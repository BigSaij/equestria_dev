 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."

 tarrin.47.d:0 "Grogar stood upon the balcony of the highest tower in Tambelon, and surveyed His realm. The bright sun shone upon the scorching sands of the Zebhara desert. He remembered how this land had once been fertile and green. Now, it was a wasteland. Perhaps one day, flowers would blossom here again.\n\n"M'lord," came a sound from behind him, and He turned. It was Bray, a donkey who had prepared the returning ritual and was His most loyal assistant. "The six goats who aided me wish to speak to you." Grogar nodded, so Bray bowed and left. Soon, the six heroes entered the balcony and knelt before Him. He already knew their names: Gore, Randy, Oskar, Giles, Abram and Rachel.\n"Rise," He commanded, and they did so. "You have proven yourself to be competent and cunning. Therefore, you shall become my advisors. Your first task is to tell me what has happened to the world while I was gone."\n"The world has gone to ruin," Rachel explained. "The lesser races have failed to find unity and squabble amongst themselves. Some of your monsters still roam the land to this day, as nobody has managed to exterminate them yet. The fools are obsessed with technology rather than magic."\n"So are you," said Randy and bleated in amusement.\n"Silence!" Grogar commanded. "If we plan to reclaim our world, then we must be better than the barbarians. I shall tolerate no infighting or tinkering with useless gadgets. Do you understand?"\n"B-but m'lord," Rachel complained, "I retrieved your bell with a telesco-"\n"Quiet! You no longer need the aid of technology. It is time for goats to once more become the masters of magic.""

 eaw_debug.4.d:0 "Grogar entered the vast vaults beneath Tambelon. The many creatures imprisoned there sensed His presence and went silent in an instant. He looked at them and remembered all he had planned to do with them, before that accursed pony, Gusty, had banished him to the Realm of Darkness.\n\nNow, he could finally fulfill those plans.\n\nHe kept walking and entered into the lower levels, where His previous creations were kept. They were all beautiful in their own way, even the failed experiments that barely lived, suffering constantly. Learning experiences had a beauty of their own, and Grogar kept them to remind himself of His failures. But the most beautiful creatures were the successful ones. He was especially proud of hydras, a creature he had made to rival His ancient enemy, the dragons. Yet there were many other fine creatures too. Some had been created by other goats, His finest apprentices. It's a shame Gusty's army had slaughtered so many of them, but he was thankful they had never discovered the vault. Otherwise, every single monster here would've been callously killed by the foolish ponies.\n\nNow it was time to release many of these captive monsters, and to put the animals to use. The might of Tambelon would slowly but surely be rebuilt. New terrible monsters would be made, and the world would learn to fear goats again."

 eaw_debug.5.t:0 "The Natural Order"
 eaw_debug.5.d:0 "Tin Zinan couldn't help but feel helpless. Out of nowhere, demonic goats had appeared out of the desert, accompanied by terrifying beasts. There was little they did to resist, and those brave ones who did quickly perished. His people, the folk of Azir, were driven out of their homes and herded like cattle into a vast, dark city which appeared like a desert mirage. There, they were all forced to work, no matter their rank. Chieftains laboured alongside servants. They were all equal in slavery now.\n\nTin Zinan had been a slave once. And he had sworn to never be one again.\n\nDay and night, they all toiled in a workshop, where they were instructed to make large plates of crystal-infused armour for the beasts. They were forced to use the most basic tools and were allowed little rest and few provisions. Tin Zinan couldn't stand for this. He had to show that zebras like him would never accept slavery. Death was preferable to it.\n\nHe stood up on a workbench and proclaimed to all other slaves: "My fellow Azirians! A most terrible fate has befallen us. Yet do not despair! Hope lives on in our hearts. One day, we shall break free from our shackles! We must never fully submit, but always use little acts of resistance to defy our evil masters. Sabotage the armour, work as slowly as possible, go on hunger strike, do anything you can to show that you are free zebras!"\n\nThe other slaves cheered and chanted his name, and a riot started as they began to break tools and dismantle the plates they had made. But it did not last long. Soon, the doors broke open and ravenous chimeras and manticores poured inside. A terrible slaughter began. Zebras screamed as they were torn apart by claws and teeth and eaten alive. Tin Zinan did his best to fight back, but it was all in vain.\n\nOn the following day, Tin Zinan and a dozen other rebellious slaves returned to the workshops. Their bodies had been biomantically modified: Mouths had been replaced with small feeding holes and their rear legs had been removed, forcing them to crawl like maggots.  It was a warning to all slaves that resistance would be punished most severely."

 eaw_debug.6.t:0 "Worrisome News"
 eaw_debug.6.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle was sipping her morning coffee while reading the news. She frowned as she saw an article talking about a famed archaeologist who had gone missing. The name was familiar to her, as she had attended his presentation about the mysterious ruins he had studied in Azir. His family was begging for any information about his whereabouts. She felt sorry for them and hoped he would be found soon, alive and well.\n\nWhile the desert of Azir was still fresh on her mind, she spotted another, tiny article talking about it. There was a brief summary of strange rumours coming out of the region with nothing substantial to support them. But it was strange coincidence that these rumours had appeared around the same time when the archaeologist had gone missing. Could there be a connection?\n\nPerhaps she was just being paranoid as always. But a part of her wanted to investigate the matter. If anything, she wanted to bring closure to the archaeologist's family."
 eaw_debug.6.a:0 "Maybe there's something more to this?"
 
 eaw_debug.7.t:0 "Investigation"
 eaw_debug.7.d:0 ""Do not worry, darling, detective Rarity will unravel the mystery!"\nTwilight frowned. "Is the costume absolutely necessary?"\n"Why yes, of course!" Rarity said, wearing a black trench coat and a fedora. "I must channel the persona of Shadow Spade to get fully immersed in the role of a detective."\nTwilight rolled her eyes. "If you say so." She turned to the door of the archaeologist's apartment and unlocked it with a key given by his family. The two ponies entered and looked around. "Hm, nothing seems out of the ordinary," Twilight mumbled.\nRarity took a closer look, narrowing her eyes and inspecting the furniture. "That is because you do not look with the eyes of a detective. Aha!" Her horn glowed and she levitated a strand of white hair. "According to your description, the missing individual did not have a white tail, coat or mane, yet I found this!"\n"That's... strange, but doesn't really prove anything. Let's keep looking, I guess."\n"Yes, the more clues the better!"\nNext they inspected the archaeologist's office table. There were various notes about previous expeditions, but nothing about Azir. "Strange," Twilight said. "I think there's some papers missing, but they're not here."\n"Tsk tsk! Again, think like a detective. What if there's a hidden compartment?"\n"...Why would he hide notes about his studies?"\nRarity leaned closer at the table and knocked at the wood with her hoof, listening closely at the sound. "Quiet, I'm trying to hear a hollow sound." After several knocks, her eyes widened and she rubbed the surface, looking for a seam. Once she found it, she used magic to pull up a lid which revealed concealed papers. "Here they are!"\nTwilight was flabbergasted as Rarity gave the papers to her. "You found them! They're all about his final survey at Azir!" She quickly skimmed over the papers and even found a few drawings. One of them depicted a strange black sphere of crystal."

 eaw_debug.8.t:0 "The Missing Goat"
 eaw_debug.8.d:0 "After investigating the archeologist's apartment, Twilight and Rarity interviewed his neighbours. When the two asked about the last time they had seen him, they all mentioned the same curious detail: A strange sound similar to multiple goats bleating which had come from his apartment. It was strange, but when Twilight studied the white strand of hair Rarity had found, she deduced that it had indeed belonged to a goat. Something very strange had happened in the apartment.\n\nGoats were few and far between, but not something the Mane Six hadn't seen before. Fluttershy had once met an assertiveness trainer known as Iron Will, who had hired several goat assistants. Because of his personal connections to this elusive race, Twilight decided to send a telegram to Asterion, asking him if he could provide them with any useful information.\n\nTurns out, he could.\n\nA response soon arrived. One of Iron Will's most important assistants, Randy the Showgoat, had gone missing after meeting a certain pony archaeologist. While Iron Will did not know what had happened to him, he did know that Randy had travelled to Equestria to visit the archeologist. Clearly, Randy had been in the apartment. But why? Why were goats interested in some desert ruins that had recently been found?\n\nTwilight realized that there was only one way to find out. She'd have to visit the ruins in person and uncover their mystery with the help of her friends."

"Besides, we're far better prepared than last time we ventured across a desert."\n"Tell me about it!" Pinkie said and drank from a comically large flask.\n"Careful with that, we need to save up for the return trip," Applejack warned.\n"How much farther must we continue?" Rarity asked, walking under the shadow of an umbrella that was held by Fluttershy.\nTwilight examined a map and a compass. "We're almost there! If my calculations are correct, that is. But they usually are!"\n"Looks like you're right," Rainbow said and pointed at the distance. "Someone's coming!"\n\nThe six ponies looked ahead and saw a large creature rapidly approaching. It did not look like a mirage.\n"Um... did you mean something?" Fluttershy asked nervously.\nApplejack squinted her eyes. "The heck is that? I don't like the look of it one bit."\n\nAs the creature got close enough, it spread its wings and took flight. It soared above them, covering the sun, and then dived.\n"Well, that, uh... that's a manticore!" Twilight exclaimed, and moments before the beast descended upon them, she created a magical forcefield around the group. The manticore slammed onto it, and immediately started clawing at it, roaring ferociously."

But I can't hold this forcefield forever!" Twilight said.\n"It looks very angry!" Fluttershy noted. "I need to calm it down!"\n"...You sure that's a good idea?" Rainbow asked. "What if I just-"\n"Everypony, back off. Twilight, lower the shield!" Fluttershy ordered. Somewhat hesitantly, the others obeyed. "Now, mister manticore, I-"\nThe beast immediately swung its claws at her, but she was pushed out of the way by Rainbow Dash. "W-wait, why didn't it listen to me?" Fluttershy asked, visibly shocked. "Maybe it's not in the mood for talking," Rainbow replied. "AJ, you know what to do!"\nApplejack nodded and pulled out a gun. "It's good we're well prepared, eh?" As the beast approached, she loaded it, took aim and fired.\n\nThe manticore was taken aback by the flash of light, grimaced at her, then fell limp and collapsed onto the sand. Rainbow covered Fluttershy's eyes. There was a moment of deafening silence.\n\nIt was broken by Pinkie. "Wow, nice shot!"\n"Heh, thanks, I've had some practice," Applejack said and put the weapon on her back. She turned to the two pegasi. "Dash, tell her I used the magical stun gun."\n"Think that'll help?" she replied sarcastially.\nFluttershy was almost sobbing. "I... I don't understand why it didn't..."\nTwilight examined the unconscious creature. "This isn't right. Manticores have never been seen in deserts."\n"Ahem... what about those creatures?" Rarity said and pointed to the horizon.\n\nDozens of beasts were approaching, creating a dust storm with their paws, claws and wings. It was a terrifying sight, and the ponies' eyes widened when they saw it. Twilight gulped. "Looks like we're going home early, girls. Gallop!""

 cityfall.999.d:0 "After the fall of the goatocracy, a genocide of an incomprehensible scale took place as the former slaves massacred their rightful masters across the entire world. Goats fled into hiding, forming secluded and isolated communities which were often persecuted.\n\nOne region where a noticeable population of goats remained was Goatlestan. Thousands of goats live here among the verdant hills in isolated villages. The dominant zebra population has, for the most part, left them alone thanks to the rugged terrain of the area, allowing the goats graze on grass in peace.\n\nBut the goats never forgot. Here, the memory of Grogar remained strong while it faded elsewhere in the world. They awaited his return for millenia, praying and never losing hope.\n\nWhen the monstrous horde of the Father arrived, they were overcome by euphoria. Grand celebrations were held in the hills as the goats rejoiced. They had waited for this day for countless generations. Thousands flocked to Tambelon, eager to join the ranks of the reforged goatocracy. The local zebras were swiftly put in chains and punished for their ancestors' crimes.\n\nThe old saying had proven to be true and wise: "Wait and hope.""
