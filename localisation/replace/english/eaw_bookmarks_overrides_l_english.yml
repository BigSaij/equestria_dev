 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of Harmony"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Choose a nation of your liking on the map."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Fall of The Empire"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. The Griffonian Empire has collapsed, leaving only fear and uncertainty in the minds of the avaricious and power-hungry griffon race. Emperor Grover V has faced secession across his old domain, republican and socialist revolutions, and the loss of the Idol of Boreas to the cyclops Arimaspi, and little expect him to survive the next few years. As revolutionaries across the continent prepare to challenge the monarchies of old, and the ponies of the East prepare for war - chaos will soon engulf Griffonia once again."
 AFTERMATH_NAME:0 "Fallout of the Storm"
 AFTERMATH_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. The conquests of the Storm King, a mad yeti from the southern lands, has left much of the continent of Zebrica in ruins. Nations struggle to pick up the pieces left behind as, in the chaos, old political troubles return to the surface seeking a new chance to rise. Even beyond the wrath of the Storm, the changing world brings with it danger to the many nations that have long stood the test of time; though the struggle is over, one thing is certain. Conflict is coming."
