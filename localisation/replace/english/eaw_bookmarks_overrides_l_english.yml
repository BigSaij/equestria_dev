They were all beautiful in their own way, even the failed experiments that barely lived, suffering constantly. Learning experiences had a beauty of their own, and Grogar kept them to remind himself of His failures. But the most beautiful creatures were the successful ones. He was especially proud of hydras, a creature he had made to rival His ancient enemy, the dragons. Yet there were many other fine creatures too. Some had been created by other goats, His finest apprentices. It's a shame Gusty's army had slaughtered so many of them, but he was thankful they had never discovered the vault. Otherwise, every single monster here would've been callously killed by the foolish ponies.\n\nNow it was time to release many of these captive monsters, and to put the animals to use.

There was little they did to resist, and those brave ones who did quickly perished. His people, the folk of Azir, were driven out of their homes and herded like cattle into a vast, dark city which appeared like a desert mirage. There, they were all forced to work, no matter their rank. Chieftains laboured alongside servants. They were all equal in slavery now.\n\nTin Zinan had been a slave once. And he had sworn to never be one again.\n\nDay and night, they all toiled in a workshop, where they were instructed to make large plates of crystal-infused armour for the beasts. They were forced to use the most basic tools and were allowed little rest and few provisions. Tin Zinan couldn't stand for this. He had to show that zebras like him would never accept slavery. Death was preferable to it.\n\nHe stood up on a workbench and proclaimed to all other slaves: "My fellow Azirians! A most terrible fate has befallen us. Yet do not despair! Hope lives on in our hearts. One day, we shall break free from our shackles! We must never fully submit, but always use little acts of resistance to defy our evil masters. Sabotage the armour, work as slowly as possible, go on hunger strike, do anything you can to show that you are free zebras!"\n\nThe other slaves cheered and chanted his name, and a riot started as they began to break tools and dismantle the plates they had made. But it did not last long. Soon, the doors broke open and ravenous chimeras and manticores poured inside. A terrible slaughter began. Zebras screamed as they were torn apart by claws and teeth and eaten alive. Tin Zinan did his best to fight back, but it was all in vain.\n\nOn the following day, Tin Zinan and a dozen other rebellious slaves returned to the workshops. Their bodies had been biomantically modified: Mouths had been replaced with small feeding holes and their rear legs had been removed, forcing them to crawl like maggots.

She felt sorry for them and hoped he would be found soon, alive and well.\n\nWhile the desert of Azir was still fresh on her mind, she spotted another, tiny article talking about it. There was a brief summary of strange rumours coming out of the region with nothing substantial to support them. But it was strange coincidence that these rumours had appeared around the same time when the archaeologist had gone missing. Could there be a connection?\n\nPerhaps she was just being paranoid as always. But a part of her wanted to investigate the matter.

She turned to the door of the archaeologist's apartment and unlocked it with a key given by his family. The two ponies entered and looked around. "Hm, nothing seems out of the ordinary," Twilight mumbled.\nRarity took a closer look, narrowing her eyes and inspecting the furniture. "That is because you do not look with the eyes of a detective. Aha!" Her horn glowed and she levitated a strand of white hair. "According to your description, the missing individual did not have a white tail, coat or mane, yet I found this!"\n"That's... strange, but doesn't really prove anything. Let's keep looking, I guess."\n"Yes, the more clues the better!"\nNext they inspected the archaeologist's office table. There were various notes about previous expeditions, but nothing about Azir. "Strange," Twilight said. "I think there's some papers missing, but they're not here."\n"Tsk tsk! Again, think like a detective. What if there's a hidden compartment?"\n"...Why would he hide notes about his studies?"\nRarity leaned closer at the table and knocked at the wood with her hoof, listening closely at the sound. "Quiet, I'm trying to hear a hollow sound." After several knocks, her eyes widened and she rubbed the surface, looking for a seam. Once she found it, she used magic to pull up a lid which revealed concealed papers. "Here they are!"\nTwilight was flabbergasted as Rarity gave the papers to her. "You found them! They're all about his final survey at Azir!" She quickly skimmed over the papers and even found a few drawings. One of them depicted a strange black sphere of crystal."

It was strange, but when Twilight studied the white strand of hair Rarity had found, she deduced that it had indeed belonged to a goat. Something very strange had happened in the apartment.\n\nGoats were few and far between, but not something the Mane Six hadn't seen before. Fluttershy had once met an assertiveness trainer known as Iron Will, who had hired several goat assistants. Because of his personal connections to this elusive race, Twilight decided to send a telegram to Asterion, asking him if he could provide them with any useful information.\n\nTurns out, he could.\n\nA response soon arrived. One of Iron Will's most important assistants, Randy the Showgoat, had gone missing after meeting a certain pony archaeologist. While Iron Will did not know what had happened to him, he did know that Randy had travelled to Equestria to visit the archeologist. Clearly, Randy had been in the apartment. But why? Why were goats interested in some desert ruins that had recently been found?\n\nTwilight realized that there was only one way to find out.

But they usually are!"\n"Looks like you're right," Rainbow said and pointed at the distance. "Someone's coming!"\n\nThe six ponies looked ahead and saw a large creature rapidly approaching.

At least they had learned that something was seriously wrong: the Zebhara desert was usually largely devoid of life, but now it was teeming with all kinds of monsters like the Everfree Forest itself. But if they wanted to find out what had happened, they'd need to go home and devise a new plan.\n\nTwilight was already busy with this while travelling on a ship to Equestria. Just before they arrived at the port of Baltimare, her eyes lit up and she exclaimed "Eureka!". She quickly explained her idea to her friends: as travel by land was so difficult and dangerous, an airplane could be used instead. It was better than flying into the desert alone, and safer from possible flying monsters like manticores, especially if it was armed with weapons. An airplane could fly straight into the desert and find the source of the monsters from above, even taking pictures if necessary. Most of the ponies agreed that it was a good idea, except for Rainbow Dash who claimed she could fly by herself with ease.

Now, however, he had fulfilled his destiny and started a new life in Tambelon, the ancient capital of goatkind. His father had told many myths about it before he had died, yet none of them could quite prepare him to live there. Goats were everywhere, living alongside monsters and slaves who fulfilled all menial jobs and assisted their masters whenever needed. Randy would never again have to be anyone's assistant ever again. This thought made him bleat quite happily.\n\nGoats were free to do whatever they wished, as long as it did not harm other goats (those who broke this fundamental law were turned into biomantically twisted, shapeless abominations, condemned to eternal suffering). Some goats chose a life of leisure and luxury, but usually got bored of it and picked some duty to fulfill like the others did. Some became biomancers, others studied the mysteries of the universe, some became slave- or beastmasters. Randy decided to put his organization skills to use and became a manager. He would assign tasks for slaves to fulfill and helped organize the running of society in Tambelon. While goats saw him as an outsider, they knew he was one of the Six who had participated in the ritual to liberate Tambelon, and was thus deeply respected. He soon proved himself capable, too, helping everything run smoothly. He did not receive wages, as he received everything necessary for a comfortable life for free.

Was that really what you did as a job?"\nHe frowned. "Well, yes, but I had to be very specific about what to eat. I had to thoroughly examine texts and only read articles that contained forbidden words or phrases."\n"Well, sounds like you could put some of your skills to use at the archive! How does that sound?"\nHe smiled. "I... suppose I could try it out. Sorry for my accent, I'm not used to speaking goatish. What's your name? I'm Abram."\n"I'm Mary. You're one of the six?!

Every day we must remember all this and thank Him. In return, we may receive His blessing, if we remain humble and obedient. Think of all the impure heathens in the world who deny the rule of the Father. They will never have a chance of being blessed. Instead, they shall be cursed and punished, made into slaves, their bodies twisted and broken as needed. For them, we shall feel no pity. This is the Path of Now and Forever: the mastery of goatkind, the goatocracy, to ensure eternal freedom and peace.\n\nMany of you lived for countless generations, for countless millenia, among heathens, myself included. Yet we remained faithful, never losing hope, knowing that one day the Father would return, when the time was right. And our faith has been rewarded, for the Father is back with us. Now the paradise of old shall return. Yet there is much work to be done. Many heathens remain arrogant and unpunished.

Our Father requires many monuments dedicated to his eternal glory. You heathens of course think this is nonsense, that your work is unimportant, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The more He is glorified, the stronger He becomes. One day you all will accept Him as your own Father, too, and abandon all thoughts of resistance, sabotage, or rebellion.

The goat nimbly dodged the flying tool, then narrowed his eyes. His horns began to glow, and the angry slave's body suddenly cracked and twisted. She let out a gurgling screech of agony as the nerves in her body snapped. Her body continued to convulse and change shape even as the screaming ended. Finally, nothing was left of her except a shapeless lump of flesh and bones.

They awaited his return for millenia, praying and never losing hope.\n\nWhen the monstrous horde of the Father arrived, they were overcome by euphoria. Grand celebrations were held in the hills as the goats rejoiced. They had waited for this day for countless generations. Thousands flocked to Tambelon, eager to join the ranks of the reforged goatocracy. The local zebras were swiftly put in chains and punished for their ancestors' crimes.\n\nThe old saying had proven to be true and wise: "Wait and hope.""

 cityfall.1000.t: "Grandfather of the Desert"
 cityfall.1000.d: "As the goat biomancers led their monstrous armies through the deserts of what the lesser races called Zarantia, they encountered an old monster variant which Grogar had once created: the Tatzlwurm. The goats were swift to take control of some of these creatures so the creation template could be reconstructed, having been lost in the chaos of the rebellion many millenia ago.\n\nThe tatzlwurm was a great addition to the goatocracy's ever expanding arsenal. The worms were perfectly adapted to the desert, and were ravenous by nature. With the template recovered, tatzlwurms could be created en masse once again."

 cityfall.1001.t: "Terror Of The Skies"
 cityfall.1001.d: "When the goats first saw one, they could not believe their eyes. A living roc, soaring across the sky, its wings spread wide. It was an enormous, carnivorous bird of prey that had once been created by Grogar. It was thought no living specimens existed, but this assumption proved to be false. The goats swiftly captured some wild rocs and brought them to Tambelon, as the template required for their creation had been lost. Grogar was pleased to see one of his prized creations had been saved from oblivion.\n\nRocs are fearsome creatures and have iron-sharp claws, capable of tearing apart the pathetic flying machines of the sub-goat races. Soon enough, the skies will belong to the goats once again."

 cityfall.1002.t:0 "Raining Rocks"
 cityfall.1002.d:0 "In the rocky Abyssinian mountains, the goats discovered another of their old creations: the slingtail. It was a reptilian creature with a strong tail which it used to throw rocks over long distances to hunt its prey. They were an ancient weapon from a primordial war against dragonkind, yet had survived in the wild for millenia. Some specimens were swiftly captured so the creation template could be recreated.\n\nThe slingtail's unique ability would give the monstrous army much needed ability to strike at long range, especially at heavily armoured or flying targets. It was proof of ingenius design, as the creature was still useful against the enemies of goatkind, even if they were very different than before."

 cityfall.1003.t:0 "Wrath Of The Guardian"
 cityfall.1003.d:0 "Southeastern Zebrica had been devastated by unchecked magic which had turned the entire region into an overgrown humid swamp. Grogar dreamt of fixing this problem and undoing the damage, reverting the region back to its original climate. However, this would require the seizure of the Golden Temple located in the middle of the peninsula. Unfortunately, a magical spirit guarded the building, feeding off its power. When the goats and their beasts tried to enter the temple, its priesthood conducted a rtual summoning the spirit, which they called the "Thunder Tiger". A gargantuan storm formed in an instant, scouring the golden city with lightning and killing everything in it, destroying and damaging buildings which included the temple itself.\n\nWith the temple destroyed, it would take decades or even centuries to conduct climate restoration in the region. It is an unfortunate setback, but there is little that even Grogar himself could do about it."
