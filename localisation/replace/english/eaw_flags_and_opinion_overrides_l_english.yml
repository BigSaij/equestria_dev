ASS_DONKEY_DESC:0 "§gBray is the most faithful servant of Grogar, and the architect of his return. He is an Asstyrian donkey who was born as a lowly commoner. Much of his adult life was spent as a caravan guard, but everything changed when he discovered a crystal ball buried in the sands of Zebhara.\n\nThe sphere observed him and influenced him, learning about him as he carried it along. Bray was unable to resist its magical power, so he became attached to the ball and hid it from others. Soon enough, Grogar contacted him through it as he needed a loyal servant to aid with the summoning ritual.\n\nBray followed the instructions closely and allowed himself to become a mere extension of Grogar's will. Whatever personality he once had is now gone, and he is nothing more than a obedient puppet of flesh and bone.§!"

biomancy_decisions_desc:0 "Biomancy as an art has been forgotten by the disgusting lesser races, and even the goats have to relearn its secrets. Yet the Overgoat remembers. He is the greatest teacher one could pray to have. In His presence, there are no such things as secrets.\n\nCurrently, we have §P[?ouroboros]§! units of living biomass."
WIT_make_manticores_desc:0 "Manticores are medium-sized creatures. The template is primarily based on a lion, with the addition of leathery wings, sensitive bat ears and a large scorpion tail. They have oversized paws for improved close combat efficiency. The wings allow it to rapidly approach enemies, and its large mouth allows it to swallow smaller creatures whole. Its sting is highly venomous, capable of killing the victim within seconds."
WIT_make_chimeras_desc:0 "Chimeras are medium-sized creatures. They are one of the oldest creatures designed by goatkind, being a shining example of biomantic amalgamation. The frontal section comes from a saber-toothed tiger, the rear section comes from a goat, and the tail is constructed out of a snake. Therefore the chimera has three heads, allowing it greater vision and cognitive power. The inclusion of a goat's head means the creature is fully sapient. Furthermore, it is enhanced with an ability to breathe fire, a feature made possible thanks to close study of dragon cadavers. The only notable design flaw of the creature is the fact that its three heads sometimes fail to cooperate."
WIT_make_hydras_desc:0 "Hydras are large creatures. The design of the template is based on dragons, the enemies of goatkind. It is a reptilian creature that has four heads with elongated necks and sharp snapping jaws. The creature also has abilities of rapid regeneration, enabling it to regrow lost heads and other body parts. It lacks the ability to fly like a dragon, but instead is designed to use methods of ambush to surprise the foe. Marshes with their murky water are ideal hiding places for a hydra. Like with the chimera, the heads do not always work together. It was the last and greatest example of multi-headed creature design."
WIT_make_pigs_desc:0 "Pigasi are small creatures. The template is an upgraded version of an older, pre-banishment design developed to fight against flying races. The original design was abandoned for being too ineffective, but the new one is specifically developed to counter aircraft. The template is simple, merging avian wings into a pig. A pigasus is too small and agile to be easily hit by large flying machines, while its enhanced metal-piercing tusks and hooves can cause significant damage to planes. Nevertheless, pigasi are primarily effective in large numbers due to their size and lack of ranged offensive abilities."
WIT_train_biomancers_desc:0 "Grogar cannot yet be everywhere at once, so lesser goat biomancers are needed on the field to heal damaged creatures and maintain control over them. However, being on the frontline is a dangerous duty. Because most goats have forgotten their abilities, the only way to replenish casualties is by training them to become biomancers. It takes time, and apprentices need an ample supply of biomass for practice, but it is the only way to restore the ancient knowledge of the goats."
WIT_multiply_biomass_desc:0 "Units of biomass have the natural ability to reproduce. Through biomantic acceleration, the growth speed of new units can be greatly increased, even if it is a painful experience for the targets. While inefficient, it remains the most reliable method of producing additional units of biomass."
WIT_harvest_biomass_desc:0 "Areas of untamed wilderness are ideal for gathering biomass which can be used for the creation of monsters. The lesser races have also domesticated some animal species and tainted them, but such livestock can still be considered usable biomass. Inhospitable regions, such as large urban areas, provide lower harvest yields while rural regions provide higher ones."

crystal_related_decisions_desc:0 "Crystals are magic in its purest and most raw form. They grow naturally in places where magical ley lines of the earth overlap, and are most commonly found in underground caves. However, this growth is very slow, so goats invented a new, faster method of creating crystals."
WIT_mana_batteries_desc:0 "The goats learned long ago that the innate magical energy of sapient beings could be condensed into crystals. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do so without killing the target. Of course, as long as there are enough non-goats to spare, it is a small price to pay for a powerful container of raw energy."
WIT_craft_armour_desc:0 "The lesser races have been thoroughly corrupted by technology, and have created new and terrible weapons of steel and sulphur. While they are powerful, they cannot rival the power of crystals. Slaves shall be put to work to create crystal-infused plates of armour to protect beasts from the pathetic toys of subgoats."

biomancy_decisions_2_desc:0 "Biomancy can be used for more than mere artistry of the flesh. It can be used as a weapon against the savage, sub-goat races. Their bodies will bend to the will of Grogar, or they will break.\n\nCurrently, we have enough magical power to cast §C[?magical_power]§! spells.\n\nCurrent §LFear Factor§! is [Root.fear_factor_dynamic_loc]."
WIT_harvest_magic_desc:0 "Every sapient creature on the planet has inherent magical power. Some, like unicorns, can channel it efficiently and use it to cast spells, while others may have more passive magical abilities. The end result remains the same: All creatures provide an excellent source of magical energy. With the Bewitching Bell, Grogar can drain it on a massive scale and ascend closer to godhood."
WIT_blood_rain_desc:0 "Turning water into blood is one of the simplest biomantic cantrips. With multiple casters combining their power, it can be applied on a massive scale. This can be used to turn the vapor in rainclouds into blood, resulting in a crimson torrent below the clouds. Blood rain has a strongly demoralizing effect on the lesser races who are likely to be horrified by it."
WIT_cancer_desc:0 "Cancer cells appear naturally in the bodies of living beings, whose immune systems usually eliminate them. However, with biomancy it is possible to cause increased cellular malfunctions to overwhelm the immune systems of the targets. The tumours will then slowly but surely terminate their life functions. It is a relatively ineffective spell, yet spreads widespread terror among the targets due to the negative reputation of the disease."
WIT_weakness_desc:0 "While it is practically impossible to directly control the bodies of thousands of living beings, biomancy can still be used to cause widespread albeit weak effects on biological structures. One example is the weakness spell, causing rapid muscle atrophy which greatly weakness the targets."
WIT_parasprites_desc:0 "Despite their small size, parasprites are some of Grogar's most effective creations. Derived from insects and purposefully designed to look visually appealing, parasprites are often easily adopted as pets by foolish sub-goats who feed them. They can then quickly reproduce asexually and form entire swarms which consume everything edible. Famine often follows parasprite infestations."
