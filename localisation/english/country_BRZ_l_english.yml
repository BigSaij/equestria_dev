# General remarks for writers: 
# Please use International (Standard/Oxford) English, also called British English. Do not use dialects (American, Canadian etc.).
# As Bronzehill is a Herzlander (German) speaking nation, you might want to use some German words for flavour or immersion. Please do this rarely and only for single words that represent important concepts (examples: Volksreligion (= People's religion) for Luxembark or Wehrsportspiele (=Military/Defence sport games) for Loudbark). If you do not speak German, ping HerrB on discord to help you out.
# Some parts of Bronzehill speak also Dogish (Khuzdul). However, Dogish words should only be used exceptionally rarely, if at all. Please ping HerrB on discord to confirm that the lore fits. Please remember that Dogish is a minority language even among the dogs of Bronzehill, only spoken by ~25% of the population, with ~95% (also) speaking Herzlander.

 BRZ_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Many griffons in Griffenheim have invested in Bronzehill, leaving very few local-owned mines, farms and factories. While this has helped develop Bronzehill's industrial capabilities, it has caused worry among locals who fear for their County's stability and soveignty.

An orphan too young to rule, a regency has been established to govern in his stead, leaving the young griffon as a powerless figurehead. However, unlike with Grover V the regents aren't selfish and corrupt fools. Not only that, but Grover VI is not sickly or weak, but has a sharp and curious mind as well as a natural talent for leadership. He has great potential, but only time will tell if it will be fulfilled.\n\nShould his Regent allow it, His Majesty Grover VI shall be crowned in Griffonstone upon his eighteenth birthday in 1021."

 # General Events
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger in the Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."

 # Industrial story events
 bronzehill_industrial.1.t:0 "The Ravensburg Dam"
 bronzehill_industrial.1.d:0 "For years, the dogs of Ravensburg had waited for this moment. The great dam near the city had finally been finished, half a year behind schedule. With it, the new industrial park, planned by Bronzekreuz and Griffenheim to provide over ten thousand new jobs in the area, could finally be powered. Many dogs and griffons had come to this momentous occasion, cheering when Count Ignatius Bronzetail cut the red band and gave the signal to start the turbines on the dam.\n\nHowever, among the wider political scene of Bronzehill, the whole project had been a rather contentious affair. While it was hard to deny that the industrial park, dubbed the \"Grover V Industrial Park\", would bring many opportunities for Bronzehill's shaken economy, it was also almost completely owned by various companies from Herzland, mostly from Griffenheim. The dam that powered the whole park was owned by Krähe-Stahl, a large industrial conglomerate from Griffenheim. The Socialist Party of Bronzehill had called the project an \"act of outright economic exploitation, supported by the government in Bronzekreuz\". The HKP and the NU had used slightly softer tones, but had likewise shown scepticism towards the planned ownership of the park. Among some circles, a future expropriation of these companies was already seen as inevitable.\n\nFar away, in an office in Griffenheim, several griffons toasted on the new project. They didn't find it necessary to personally come to Bronzehill, but they surely loved the thought about how many idols would flow into their deep, deep pockets."
 bronzehill_industrial.1.a:0 "Is this the future for Bronzehill?"
 
 bronzehill_industrial.2.t:0 "An Argument in the Family"
 bronzehill_industrial.2.d:0 "The door burst open and an angry looking Barnaby galloped into Ignatius' office. Ignatius looked up, calmly, but with a stern look on his face upon the sudden iterruption.\n\n\"Father, have you really signed EVEN MORE contracts with that maar-damned Krähe-Stahl?\" The crown prince fixated his father with his eyes, his anger and disappointment clearly visible. \"Bronzehill is becoming more and more a colony of these businessgriffs! Do you really think that the people will not notice? All the major parties condemned how the Grover V Industrial Park was organized, and here you are doing more of the same?\"\n\nIgnatius let out a sigh. \"My dear son and crown prince, even you are not allowed to burst into my office and yell at me. If I do something, I usually have a good reason for it. But I see from your look that perhaps you haven't gotten it.\" Ignatius pointed to a chair in front of the desk. \"So, please, sit down and listen. You will eventually come to rule this country, and so I should indeed explain this to you. Bronzehill's economy isn't doing well. You perhaps do not know the old prosperity, in the times of before the revolution tore everything asunder. Back then, Bronzehill was the blast furnace of the empire, with the forges of the dogs delivering the finest metals to every corner of it. The Bronzehillian economy was in excellent shape, one of the best of in these times. Then came the revolution, and everything fell apart. But these companies are interested in Bronzehill's ores. They want Bronzehill to once more become the forge of the empire, or what is left of it. We desperately need these investments. I will not bow to some dogs from the streets that seem to know everything better.\"\n\nBarnaby said nothing for a while, but he shook his head. \"I can tell you, father, the dogs from the streets have more power than you assume.\""

 # Introduction story events
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.t:0 "The Chairdogship"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius and crown prince Barnaby sat together in the drawing room of Bronzekreuz Castle. The old castle had been the residence of the Bronzetail family ever since Bronzehill was founded in 792 ALB and had been built partially underground. Diamond dogs had lived underground since time immemorial over in Diamond Mountain, and when the ancestors of Bronzehills population fled and found a new home here, they partially continued this tradition. The drawing room in the castle was one of the underground rooms, only dimly lit by the chandaliers on the ceiling.\n\n\"Barnaby, my son, as you are probably aware, I have decided to call the Bronzehill council. The crisis that has overtaken Griffenheim has severely impacted Bronzehill as well. Our nation mournes, as do we, therefore it is neccessary to show unity.\" Barnaby wagged his tail in approval. \"But this is not enough. I have also decided that you, my prince, should get the chairdogship in the council. It is only good if the people of Bronzehill see you take responsibility, and I think, you are ready for it.\"\n\n\"I see your point and agree with it. I will lead the council and look for that the council has only the best interest of Bronzehill in mind. Have you decided yet whom to invite?\"\n\nA servant brought in a plate of meatballs. Ignatius and Barnaby ate silently for a while, before Ignatius answered:"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.a:0 "\"No. I will need to arrange some meetings.\""
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.t:0 "The Old Reformer"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.d:0 "Ignatius had decided to meet Winston Copperhill in his club in Bronzekreuz. In one of back rooms of this club they could discuss political matters in a private atmosphere, far away from nosey listeners. The waiter of the club had brought them strong Hindian tea as well as a plate of ham slices, before being told to prevent anydog from entering.\n\nLord Winston Copperhill, 62 years old, widower and father of three, was an established figure in the political landscape of Bronzehill. Born in the better times of Grover IV, Copperhill saw the ineffective regency for Grover V with horror, before seeing everything collapsing in the revolution of 978. At the time, Copperhill had been a Hussar in Bronzekreuz Hussars. His regiment however did not saw fighting, but was tasked to protect Bronzehills cities. None-the-less, the revolution left a deep impression on Copperhill, who just a few years later decided to abandon him career in the army in favour of a political one. It was in part due to his influence that Count Georgie, Ignatius father, passed the \"Georgian reforms\", which introduced the city councils and allowed the formation of political parties, albeit with some restrictions. Copperhill immediately got to work, becoming a founding member of the Harmonic-Conservatives, the HKP. In 989, he became the second chairdog of the HKP, a role that he filled out dutifully for the last 18 years. As chairdog, he continued to advocate for both democratic and harmonic reform, calling for the establishment of a Bronzehillian parliament. The HKP under him also advocates for greater autonomy for Bronzehill, with Copperhill denouncing the businessgriffs investing in Bronzehill for their exploitative practices. In all of this, the Copperhill, nicknamed \"the old reformer\", had found a enthusiastic young follower, crown prince Barnaby, who was in turn nicknamed \"the young reformer\". Ignatius however had been wary of this friendship in the past, seeing the enthusiasm of his son for democracy with scepticism.\n\nAfter two hours of discussion, touching various political issues, Copperhill had secured a place for him and some of his party colleges in the Bronzehill Council. Ignatius did not tell him that Barnaby would be chairdog, and Copperhill had not mentioned it either, but the old dog probably already knew."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.a:0 "How much reform does Bronzehill need, and how much would break it?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.t:0 "An Usual Guest"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.d:0 "Bronzekreuz Castle may not have been the biggest castle, but it surely had its fair share of secrets. Barnaby had spent much of his youth exploring the secret rooms you could find in the underground parts of the castle, from unused wine cellars over rusty armouries to dilapidated meeting rooms, where you could find old war plans hanging on the walls. As a cub, this had been a lot of fun for him and his sister Margaret, but now it came in useful for more serious purposes. He had invited an usual guest into the castle, and they both had agreed that their conversation should better remain private.\n\nIn one of the old meeting rooms, Barnaby and Rosey Luxembark sat on old chairs around an even older table. Rosey Luxembark, 46 years old, was the current chairdog of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill (SPB). While her party was tolerated, if only barely, much of her writings had officially been banned from Bronzehill for \"inciting political violence\". Yet, for all the supposed radicalism, the SPB was still a special case in the socialist movement, for openly supporting the Griffenstone dynasty and the empire. However, Luxembark still envisioned a major shift in political power, as in her writings, she saw the monarchy in more of a figurehead position. The real power, she argued, should be vested in the workers, organized into workers councils and owning their workplaces. The worker councils should then be organized into a wider political party, which would form the national government. Luxembark also openly criticized the Archonates, as she saw them as not serving their communities, rather, she argued, the Archons demanded their communities to serve them, which she saw as an inversion of how things should be. Despite these ideas for grant political reform, she still saw a place for the nobles and archons to continue even in her vision, albeit only as figureheads. She claimed that this \"institutional continuity\" would serve the workers movement to stay away from radicalism and violence, which she condemned.\n\nBarnaby and Luxembark discussed the current prospects of the SPB and the workers movement. It had been Barnaby's idea that maybe Luxembark could also be invited into the Bronzehill council, to serve as a voice for the workers. Luxembark seemed open to the idea. The workers movement would still need the streets, but the council could serve as a good platform as well."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.a:0 "Barnaby and Luxembark parted in good spirit, but each with their own thoughts."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.t:0 "A Word with Loudbark"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.d:0 "It was quite unusual for the Count of Bronzehill to visit the barracks in Barkgenz, but Loudbark had ensured him that there they would find an opportunity to speak without needless listeners. However, while Ignatius had hoped to find Loudbark alone, apparently for the Unterwachtmeister his deputy Lassie Goldcoat did not count as such. But otherwise, Loudbark had kept his word, as he led Ignatius to a bunker just off the military area, where they could discuss undisturbed.\n\nRufus Loudbark, 29 years old and former Unterwachtmeister in the Garde-Artillerie-Regiment, was the chairdog of the National Union for the Salvation of Bronzekreuz, just called National Union (NU) for short. Despite his young age, he had already quite the time in the military, joining at just 18 years old as an infanterist in the guards. As simple soldier he joined the NU, back then mostly an organization in the military. However, his oratory skill had brought him far, and after taking the chairdogship of the NU three years ago the party has grown massively. Loudbark also swayed parts of the peasantry to his side, as well as a share of military minded nobles and even clergy, focusing on \"bread and butter\" issues. With choosing Lassie Goldcoat has his deputy, an escaped slave from Diamond Mountain and one of the few dogs without military background in leading positions, he further reinforced that image of the NU as a mass movement. However, in all of this, the NU has not abandoned its military ideals. The party still argues for the massive expansion of Bronzehills military, and also for greater autonomy from Griffenheim. In this regard Loudbark especially denounced the businessgriffs from the Herzland \"making profits off the common dog\".\n\nIgnatius was uneasy about Loudbark's influence on Bronzehill, but there was no denying that he was a rising star in the political scene. With some of the old nobles already supporting the NU, it would have its fair share of influence in the Bronzehill council."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.a:0 "Is militarism really an answer?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.t:0 "Up in the Hills"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.d:0 "The shack looked exactly how he remembered it, poor, dirty and generally in disrepair. How many years had it been? At least four, maybe five. Kimball Barking-Sun looked at his old home, here in the village he was born. Kaza-Narag was not a special village, one of many coal mining villages in the upper mountains of Bronzehill. Once a week large trucks arrived to carry away the coal mined, in exchange for food and other necessities. But they were never generous. How was this not slavery? Had they even escaped the mountain tyrant, the slaver of Diamond Mountain, or had they just exchanged his rule for that of his minions?\n\nBut Barking-Sun was not here for nostalgia. No, pressing issues were on the agenda. An opportunity how it could only ever happen once a century had opened. From his spies, Barking-Sun knew of the meeting between Luxembark and the crown prince. If Ignatius would dismiss Barnaby's proposal - which he would do, as minion of the mountain tyrant - Barking-Sun would finally find his opening to oust Luxembark as chairdog of the SPB and wrangle control of the party for himself. And then, the real task begun, namely to overthrow the rule of the nobles and archons in Griffenheim and to free Grover VI, for that he could embrace the spirit of his ancestor. Finally, the old wrong could be corrected, the misfortune of Grover II overcome. And if everything would go according to his plan, the rule of the mountain tyrant could finally be ended for good, with Grover VI leading the creatures of Griffonia to true liberty. Four Grovers later than it should have been.\n\nBut for all these lofty plans, he needed the support of the mining dogs. They knew him, and they trusted him. He had worked for years here, besides them, and he knew what steered them. Things would need to start moving, for if this change was missed, how long would it be before another one would present itself?"

 bronzehill_revenge.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius had struggled to keep it together for weeks now, ever since the news of the Emperor's death had torn his world apart, and he sat listlessly behind his desk, shuffling papers back and forth when the messenger came storming in through the door, a telegram in his paw and gasping, as if he had been running all the way here.\n\n"Sir... sir..." he panted, holding out the Telegram. "News from Griffenheim... someone... someone..." the dog couldn't say more and Ignatius slowly took the letter, staring at the short message. He blinked, unable to understand the words at first. He read it over and over, as if it was written in a different language, but soon the paper fell from his paw. A... a coup? And the crown prince had been...\n\nHe unsteadily stood up, stumbling away form his desk. It couldn't be, that letter had to be wrong... it couldn't be! Not that too! Not that too! He screamed, howling in despair as he slammed his paws against the wall, pounding it furiously as he slowly sank down to his knees, whining incoherently. He didn't even comprehend what was going on as two guards came into the room, pulling him away from the wall as he kept slamming his now bleeding paws into it, nor could he understand them when they tried to reach through to him.\n\nIn the end, Count Ignatius was dragged out of his office and brought to the hospital, even as the news spread from the palace to the city and from the city to the country. Not enough that the emperor was dead, someone had murdered his son as well. The lineage of Grover, their savior, has gone, it was snuffed out, and in its place the military had taken control over in Griffenheim."

The dogs soon advanced from the outskirts to the center of the city until they reached the palace where the Imperial Guard fought ferociously before being killed thanks to the Guard refusing surrender. After the palace was taken, the dogs cheered as they secured the Emperor from the clutches of the Imperials holding him under their regency. Soon after, the remaining soldiers surrendered in mass in order to avoid their own deaths and were given fair treatment after the battle ended."

Despite the ruthlessness of the dogs, many of the Imperial army fought a ferociously against Bronzehill and ended up getting gun down on sight after much deliberation by various soldiers. Eventually whatever remnants soon evacuated the city in small groups or deserted the frontlines from the harsh bloodshed and futility of fighting. In the end, the city was taken with heavy casualties by Bronzehill troops and was in ruins as well. However, hours after the fighting, some of the civilians that were previously hiding in the rubble were coming out to see the city taken over by the dogs. Soon after, many civilians started hugging what they saw as their liberators and thanked them for saving them as the madness has finally ended."

 BRZ_count_ignatius_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th December 965, Sandstone House, Bronzehill\n\n§YBiography§!: Count Ignatius has ruled Bronzehill since the death of his father Count Georgie in 997. When he was five years old, he travelled to the Imperial City to see Grover V's coronation and was enamoured by the splendour. He returned to the city many times and studied there at Emperor's College, gaining a degree in politics.\n\nHe became a close friend of the Emperor, who attended his wedding to Izzy Bones-Iron, daughter of the Lord Gems. With her he has had two children, Barnaby and Margaret.\n\nDuring his rule he has been a competent administrator and a beloved defender of Bronzehill and the Emperor, however his policies on supporting Griffon industry over Bronzehill's own has led to the formation of several communist organisations in Bronzehill. And while he has the full support of the Bronze Council, there are those who question his ability to lead effectively should Bronzehill be faced by a disaster such as the Republican Uprising during his father's reign.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

His village was Dogish-speaking, something which is looked down upon in wider Bronzehill, and he recieved only token education as a child. At the age of 14 years, he started to work in the coal mines, where he formulated his ideology, based on a combination of folk stories and communist agitation which had spread into the mines. After joining a underground trade union, he learned to read and write in secret, while also becoming a local agitator and organizator.\n\nBarking-Suns political believes, especially with respect to the Griffonstone dynasty, are controversial among not only the wider socialist community (which rejects many of his views outright), but even inside of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill. However, through dedication and hard work, he has won his place in the party - and after overthrowing the \"liberal\" Luxembark, he can finally put his theory into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

Her family had liberal political believes and promoted a universal education, with her learning literature from an early age. Her father used his modest prosperity to enable Rosey and her five brothers to study in the prestigious universities of southern Herzland. Rosey enrolled to study economics, engineering, sociology and biology.\n\nDuring her studies, she became a socialist writer. She then decided to switch to study law, to work as lawyer and journalist for the socialist movement. Back in Bronzehill, she was a founding member of the Socialist Party, becoming its second chairman after August Barken. Among fellow socialists, her pro-monarchy views are a continuous topic of controversy, especially her idea of \"institutional continuity\" for achieving true communism. However, few griffons and dogs of Herzland can deny her commitment to the workers movement, democratic reform and socialist theory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

After five years, he was transferred to the artillerists and got a promotion, but only to Unterwachtmeister.\n\nDuring his time in the military, Loudbark joined the National Union, which was initially mostly aimed at soldiers. He quickly rose through the party ranks due to his oratory skill. After becomeing its chairdog in 1004, he has extended the party's platform and promoted the populist Lassie Goldcoat to be his deputy, appealing also to rural and nationalist dogs.

He grew up as a member of Bronzehill's elite during the peaceful reign of Emperor Grover IV. He was one of a few Diamond Dogs who went to the military academy in Helheim and was commissioned as a Leutnant in 966.\n\nAfter a time as a member of the Imperial Guard, he was granted a seat on the Bronze Council in 971 and was a close advisor to the Count. He was often controversial with his desire for social reform and his support of local Bronzehill businesses over Imperial ones. He was a founding member of the Harmonic Conservative Party and sort to bring greater representation of the common hound into the Bronze Council.\n\nDuring the Republican Uprising he was temporary promoted to Oberstleutnant, although did not participate in the fight to restore the Emperor to the throne. The event however convinced him that the only way to ensure the safety of the Emperor is to make Bronzehill strong and ready to fight. A rallying call that has put him at odds with many even in his own party. But his stubbornness and oratory talent have kept him at the forefront of politics.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Flake"
