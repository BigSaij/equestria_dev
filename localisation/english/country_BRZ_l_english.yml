# General remarks for writers: 
# Please use International (Standard/Oxford) English, also called British English. Please do not use American English.
# As Bronzehill is a Herzlander (German) speaking nation, you might want to use some German words for flavour or immersion. Please do this rarely and only for single words that represent important concepts (examples: Volksreligion (= People's religion) for Luxembark or Wehrsportspiele (=Military/Defence sport games) for Loudbark). If you do not speak German, ping HerrB on discord to help you out.
# Some parts of Bronzehill speak also Dogish (Khuzdul). However, Dogish words should only be used exceptionally rarely, if at all. Please ping HerrB on discord to confirm that the lore fits. Please remember that Dogish is a minority language even among the dogs of Bronzehill, only spoken by ~25% of the population, with ~95% (also) speaking Herzlander.
# Thank you! - HerrB

 ## Industrial
 
 # Starting
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Finish the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The \"Grover V Industrial Park\" is the name given to large industrial park near Ravensburg. It is almost ready to be opened, but the dam to generate the electricity had been plagued by problems for the last month. It is time to put in the effort and finish this."
 
 BRZ_paving_the_roads:0 "Paving the Roads"
 BRZ_paving_the_roads_desc:0 "Now that the new industrial park is open, we have to make the most out of it. The roads around Ravensburg could use some better paving, so that goods can flow in and out of the industrial park. We will get to work."
 
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers:0 "Invite Griffenheim Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers_desc:0 "While the Grover V Industrial Park surely is a good investment, we need to be prepared for any future trouble. We will invite engineers from Griffenheim to work and live in Ravensburg, so that we can keep the park operational if a catastrophy like 978 would shake the empire again."
 
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Contracts with the Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "Why should we stop here? With the Grover V Industrial Park starting to be a success story, this can only mean good things for the Bronzehill economy. Our dear Count Ignatius will sign even more contracts will companies from Griffenheim."
 
 # Shared
 
 # Autonomist side
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Nationalize the Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "It was utter insanity to allow the park to be operated in the way it was. Herzlander companies bought out more and more of the Bronzehillian economy, and our government only watched it happen. We will fix that, starting with the park itself."
 
 # Loyalty side
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl:0 "Negotiations with Krähe-Stahl"
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl_desc:0 "Now that the political situation is somewhat under control, we can resume our long task of resolving Bronzehill's economic crisis. A first step in this is to negotiate with Krähe-Stahl, one of the main operators of the Grover V Industrial Park."
 
 ## Political Initial
 
 # Introduction
 BRZ_call_the_bronzehill_council:0 "Call the Bronzehill Council"
 BRZ_call_the_bronzehill_council_desc:0 "The death of our dear emperor Grover V has caused a major political crisis in Bronzehill. Count Ignatius therefore will convene the Bronzehill Council, to deliberate the way how to go forward."
 
 BRZ_tea_with_copperhill:0 "Tea with Copperhill"
 BRZ_tea_with_copperhill_desc:0 "One of the most prominent politicians in Bronzehill, Lord Winston Copperhill is the leader of the Harmonic-Conservative Party (HKP). As one of the influencial figures in Bronzehill, Count Ignatius wants to meet the Lord in private."
 
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest_desc:0 "Count Ignatius is not the only one who is interested in potential councillors. Barnaby had an idea of his own, and has invited an unusual guest into Bronzehill Castle, to discuss some things that Ignatius doesn't need to know about - for now at least."
 
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark:0 "A Word with Loudbark"
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark is the chairdog of the militarist and populist National Union, and fully lives up to his name. But in this matter, Count Ignatius preferes a more calm environment, for some things need to be discussed discretely."
 
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills:0 "Up in the Hills"
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills_desc:0 "Not all power in Bronzehills comes from the palace. Even though the Count rules absolute, there are plenty of dogs who hold little loyalty to him. And one of them had just found out very interesting details to think about."
 
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg_desc:0 "The prelate of Bronzehill, located in Ravensburg, is normally only concerned with religious matters. However, the current prelate Gunhild also has expressed some concerns about the political climate of Bronzehill. Count Ignatius will certainly listen."
 
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas:0 "Barnaby's Ideas"
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas_desc:0 "The final list of councillors is almost complete. All the political factions in Bronzehill have found their place in the council. Or have they? Crown Prince Barnaby think that Ignatius has forgotten something, but Barnaby has already an idea."
 
 BRZ_the_councils_opens:0 "The Council Opens"
 BRZ_the_councils_opens_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council has been called. Count Ignatius will open the council with a speach to the councillors, and then Prince Barnaby will oversee the deliberation of the council. And at the end, surely, the Council will make a united statement in support of Ignatius and the regent in Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_a_change_of_course:0 "A Change of Course"
 BRZ_a_change_of_course_desc:0 "We have decided to accept the vote of the Bronzehill Council. Count Ignatius will step back, but now the Bronzehill Council needs to find a way out of the political crisis."
 
 BRZ_old_loyalties:0 "Old Loyalties"
 BRZ_old_loyalties_desc:0 "We have decided to dismiss the vote of the Bronzehill Council. The dogs will prove their loyalty to the emperor not by trying to overthrow his regency, but by fighting along them for the glory of the empire."
 
 # Regent in Exile path
 
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile:0 "The Regent in Exile"
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has become regent in Griffenheim, much to the dismay of the nobility, including Count Ignatius. Bronzehill will not stand by this theocratic madness, but instead support Gabriela Eagleclaw, who has vowed to wrangle the regency of Eros and to rehabilitate the nobility."
 
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter:0 "Trip to Readewetter"
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter_desc:0 "If we want to support Gabriela in overthrowing the Archon and taking the regency, we need to formalize our alliance as soon as possible. Count Ignatius will personally travel to Readewetter to meet Gabriela and to discuss further details."
 
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp:0 "Work with the HKP"
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp_desc:0 "In contrast to the radicals from the Socialists or the National Union, the Harmonic-Conservatives are not a fundamental thread to Bronzehill. While their reform agenda might be uncomfortable to some, in this situation they are our best bet to coax back some of the support we have lost."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command:0 "Purge the High Command"
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command_desc:0 "The high command has shown a disturbingly close relationship with Loudbark’s National Union. In the current political climate, these connections could easily become a thread to our rule. We will retire the worst offenders, while promoting new staff from the loyal nobility."
 
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate:0 "Help from the Prelate"
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Gunhild is not too happy that we have thrown our support behind Gabriela – as appointee from Eros, she argued in favour of his regency. However, Gunhild knows her position, as well as the current political climate. We will work together to curb the ongoing socialist agitation."
 
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights:0 "Loyalty of the Knights"
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights_desc:0 "Much like Gunhild, Grandmaster Lucky from the Knights of Bronzekreuz has shown a preference for Eros. We will need to remind the Knights that they have sworn an oath to us. To further bind them to our cause, we will send them to hunt the last socialist agitators that continue to be a thorn in our side."
 
 BRZ_gather_noble_support:0 "Gather Noble Support"
 BRZ_gather_noble_support_desc:0 "The nobles of Bronzehill are the fundament of our rule, now more than ever. Yet a surprising amount of nobles seems to be rather passive, instead of openly supporting the Count. We have to remind them of what is at stake here."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council:0 "Dismiss the Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_desc:0 "With our rule secured, we can finally proclaim the crisis to be over and send the councillors home. They have been an obstacle to our goals for long enough."
 
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry:0 "Trade with Strawberry"
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry_desc:0 "After we have favoured Gabriela over Eros, our trade with Griffenheim has predictably taken a hit. However, our alliance with Strawberry also includes various economic treaties. It is high time we act on these treaties and bring our economy back on track."
 
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts:0 "Renegotiate Industrial Contracts"
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts_desc:0 "At the time we negotiated with Krähe-Stahl and other companies from Griffenheim over future investment in Bronzehill, nodog could have seen coming that we would break with Griffenheim. But it has happened, and now we have to secure our economy. We will approach them to renegotiate some of the clauses in our investment pacts."
 
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support:0 "Rebuild Popular Support"
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support_desc:0 "This whole affair has cost us a fair bit of popular support. But with the political crisis mostly over, we can focus on rebuilding the trust of the common dog."
 
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares:0 "Shuffle Industrial Shares"
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares_desc:0 "Not all companies that we have investment agreements with are from Griffenheim. In fact, a fair share of them is from Strawberry, which already is one of the richer parts of Herzland. With some targeted laws and regulations, we will shift our support to the companies that are compatible with our new alignment."
 
 BRZ_in_denfence_of_tradition:0 "In Defence Of Tradition"
 BRZ_in_denfence_of_tradition_desc:0 "It is important to remember for every dog that we fight for a just cause: Against theocratic radicalism and for the trusted rule of the nobility. We will spread the message across Bronzehill, so that every dog can see why we stand against Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors:0 "Invite Yale Professors"
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors_desc:0 "Bronzehill’s academia is quite small in comparison to the intellectual centres in Herzland. To improve our research efforts, we will invite griffon professors from Greenback and Yale. If we give out generous grants, hopefully a sufficient number will join us so that our academia gets a noticeable boost."
 
 # Loyalty to Griffenheim path
 
 BRZ_the_rightful_regent:0 "The Rightful Regent"
 BRZ_the_rightful_regent_desc:0 "Our bonds to Griffenheim will not be shaken, regardless of whom the wise griffons of Grover's court choose as regent. The dogs of Bronzehill are there to serve the emperor, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim:0 "Envoy to Griffenheim"
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "We have thrown our full support behind the rightful regent, but this does not solve our political crisis at home yet. When we send an official envoy to Griffenheim it will not only show the empire our admiration, but also serve as a warning to our political opponents at home."
 
 BRZ_gather_the_knights:0 "Gather the Knights"
 BRZ_gather_the_knights_desc:0 "Grandmaster Lucky of the Knights of Bronzekreuz has already expressed interest in taking on the problem with the socialists in our country. We have long been hesitant, but in our new situation, we need decisive action. Grandmaster Lucky can deliver that."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility:0 "Unite the Nobility"
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility_desc:0 "We should not forget that a fair few nobles in the council seemed to favour the notion of a Bronzehill regency. But now that the matter is decided, we need to unite the nobles behind us. Division makes us weak in the face of our political opponents that still hide in the shadows."
 
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies:0 "Clear Military Hierachies"
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies_desc:0 "One of the most pressing issues for us is the loyalty of the army – Loudbark seems to have infiltrated the army rather successfully. We should ask in Griffenheim for some army advisors, which would bolster our command structure and coincidentally also make it secured against a future takeover attempt."
 
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB:0 "Outlaw the SPB"
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB_desc:0 "This farce has been going on for long enough. We have tried to handle the socialist movement by making some reforms while banning their more dangerous ideas, yet it has not come to fruition. Now, we will make the hammer come down and outright ban the Socialist Party."
 
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages:0 "Spread Loyalist Messages"
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages_desc:0 "Every dog should know that what we aspire to is to help and support the emperor. This is the least common denominator for every dog in Bronzehill, and we will base our propaganda efforts on it. The idea of a Bronzehill-led regency is just crazy-talk by dangerous people."
 
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim:0 "Invite Advisors from Griffenheim"
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim_desc:0 "Bronzehill’s industry is still lacking, and the ongoing political crisis has shaken our administration as well. What could be more natural to ask our overlord to help us out? Griffon advisors will make everything easier, while also helping to control any lingering unrest."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist:0 "Dismiss the Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist_desc:0 "The crisis is over, finally. The Bronzehill Council has been a thorn in our side instead of being helpful, but now we have gathered enough political strength to send them home. Boreas bless them, and farewell."
 
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity:0 "A True Show of Unity"
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council was originally intendent to show the united support of the dogs for the emperor. This worked rather mediocre, to be polite. However, with the political crisis over, we are finally ready to unite behind the emperor and his regent. Our bond will never be broken."
 
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs:0 "Most Loyal and Faithful Dogs"
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs_desc:0 "The newfound unity of the dogs will also make itself known in the army. If we fight, we fight for the emperor, and we will fight proudly under his flag."
 
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim:0 "Reinvigorate Trade with Griffenheim"
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim_desc:0 "Despite our strong bonds, the economic relation with Griffenheim has been lacking lately, mostly due to their own economic troubles. But with the empire slowly getting back on track, our trade relationship should deepen again. If we do it right, Bronzehill’s economy will gain a good boost out of this."
 
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park:0 "The Grover V Memorial Park"
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park_desc:0 "Grover V was truly a great emperor. A grand park in Bronzekreuz will be constructed to honour and remember him. This will both serve as a nice addition to our city, being a place to relax and enjoy, and also as a reminder for all dogs that we are the most loyal subjects of his majesty."
 
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire:0 "The Forge of the Empire"
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire_desc:0 "In the old times, before it all came crashing down in the revolution, Bronzehill was known as the “Forge of the Empire”. We dogs are well versed in how to extract and refine the treasures of the earth, be it metals or gems. While we might have a long way to go before our old glory can be reclaimed, we will make our efforts known."
 
 # Barking-Sun path
 
 BRZ_barking_suns_coup:0 "Barking-Sun's Coup"
 BRZ_barking_suns_coup_desc:0 "With the Bronzehill Council in deadlock, Barking-Sun has finally made his move and overthrown the government with the help of his loyal mining dogs. The Count has fled, but resistance to our rule remains. Our great task begins here."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_army:0 "Secure the Army"
 BRZ_secure_the_army_desc:0 "The Army is the institution most hostile to our new government. But when Barking-Sun can appeal to the mining dogs, he can also sway the common soldier. As for the commanders... we need to destroy the old command structure of the army as quickly as possible, to secure a future for our regime."
 
 BRZ_target_the_national_union:0 "Target the National Union"
 BRZ_target_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is our greatest political enemy. Now that we have taken control of Bronzekreuz, we can finally move to destroy them once and for all. Down with the reaction!"
 
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp:0 "Disband the HKP"
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp_desc:0 "The Harmonic-Conservative Party is a group of weaklings, pseudo-reformers and double-faced reactionaries. Their claims of peace and liberty are lies to deceive the working class, for they want to keep the old oppressors in their lofty positions. Our revolution has made them terrified, and rightfully so: They are the next to go."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge the Nobles"
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have already seen from where the wind is blowing and have abandoned their estates. However, others are fighting in the shadows or openly defy our rule. Here, any temperance would be our downfall, we have to strike fast and hard."
 
 BRZ_hunt_the_count:0 "Hunt the Count"
 BRZ_hunt_the_count_desc:0 "Ignatius, the old Count of Bronzehill, has fled the capital as our revolution broke out. His whereabouts is currently unknown, an unacceptable security risk for our government. We will start a great hunt to either force him to flee our borders or, even better, to have him executed."
 
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy:0 "Mobilize the Economy"
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy_desc:0 "We have the high goal of marching on Griffenheim and saving Grover VI from his ill advisors and deceptive nobles. However, for that we need guns, cannons and other war material. We will have to fully mobilize the economy of Bronzehill and Barking-Sun has just the right ideas on how to do it."
 
 BRZ_liberation_corps:0 "Liberation Corps"
 BRZ_liberation_corps_desc:0 "The ''Befreiungskorps'' (Liberation Corps) are special units staffed with only the most loyal supporters of Barking-Sun, mostly his old comrades from the mines. They will be essential for conquering Griffenheim. May they live up to their name!"
 
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication:0 "Principle of Total Dedication"
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication_desc:0 "The Principle of total dedication is quite simple: Everything for the emperor. We work, fight and die for him. There can no thought but his liberation on our minds. This is our duty, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_industrial_independence:0 "Industrial Independence"
 BRZ_industrial_independence_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill is still entangled in trade with Griffenheim and other parts of Herzland. With nothing but traitors to the emperor surrounding us, we cannot accept this, but we need to work extra hard to ensure our industrial independence."
 
 BRZ_new_academia:0 "New Academia"
 BRZ_new_academia_desc:0 "The academic system of Bronzehill needs a total makeover. We need to focus our research efforts on the things that matter to us, namely how to best defeat the false regent in Griffenheim. Otherwise, we need to cull research that is not on our political line."
 
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy:0 "Barking-Sun's philosophy"
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy_desc:0 "Barking-Sun is not much of an academic writer, but he surely has a clear view of the world. With the help of some academic that have proven their loyalty, Barking-Sun will publish a book for every good dog to carry around. As it is printed with a red cover, it will soon enough be known as the ''little red book''."
 
 # Luxembark path
 
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate:0 "The Outsider Candidate"
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate_desc:0 "To the surprise of everyone, Rosey Luxembark has won the race for chancellorship. The more established political parties are still in utter confusion how she got here, but our new government has a clear task: To reform Bronzehill so that the workingdogs can finally take their fair share."
 
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs:0 "A Government for the Workingdogs"
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs_desc:0 "The SPB always was the true defender of working rights in Bronzehill. We have stood up for the common dog when others hid behind promises of reform or populist lies. Now that we have the strings of power in our paws, we can truly bring forth a government for the workingdogs."
 
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles:0 "Curtail the Nobles"
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have reacted with concern to Luxembark’s chancellorship, with some even calling for openly resisting her rule. With cannot stand. While we don’t intend to abolish their titles, we need to curtail their political power so that they can no longer threaten our plans to reforge the economy."
 
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws:0 "Reverse the Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "For a long time, the operations of the SPB and the socialist movement were hamstringed by a series of laws dubbed the ''socialist laws'', which outlawed our organizations and writings. However, with this, the reactionaries have set a legal precedent, which we can now turn on its head. From now on, reactionary propaganda is banned in Bronzehill."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union:0 "Purge the National Union"
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is a collection of militarists, reactionaries and imperialists, in short, the anti-thesis to our government. And of course, their chairdog Rufus Loudbark has tried to turn the army against our government ever since it came to be. But with the new anti-reactionary laws at paw, we can finally shatter their movement."
 
 BRZ_replace_the_count:0 "Replace the Count"
 BRZ_replace_the_count_desc:0 "Until now, Count Ignatius has accepted our government, if only barely. However, there can be little doubt that he intends to overthrow our government as soon as he gets the opportunity. While Rosey Luxembark does not intend to abolish the monarchy, we could just force Ignatius to abdicate in favour of Barnaby, who is much less of a threat to our government."
 
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils:0 "Introduce Worker Councils"
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils_desc:0 "One of the key program points is the establishment of worker councils, which would serve as a democratic root for the socialist party. However, let us not put our hind paws in the front. For now, the worker councils will not directly take over the economy, but serve as counsel for the factory workers."
 
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs:0 "Expropriate the Oligarchs"
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs_desc:0 "The businessgriffs from Herzland, but also various domestic nobles and businessdogs have formed an oligarchical power structure that controls Bronzhill’s economy. We cannot stand for this. We will expropriate the worst cases and levy heavy taxes on the rest, so that our government can gain back control over our economy."
 
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog:0 "March of the Working Dog"
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog_desc:0 "The ''March of the Workingdogs'' is a famous political song from Bronzehill, adapted by us as the new anthem. United we stand, for the common good. Singing this song, we will march on Griffenheim and bring forth a new era of socialist cooperation and workers democracy."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry:0 "Sway the Peasantry"
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The agrarian population of Bronzehill is large and consists of many destitute dogs and griffons. Yet, they have not heart our call and stayed apathetic to our government’s reforms. We have to go on the offensive and listen to their issues, so that the every dog can stand united."
 
 BRZ_worker_self_organization:0 "Worker Self-Organization"
 BRZ_worker_self_organization_desc:0 "First results from the expropriation of nobles are in, and the results are astounding. It is clear that factories work better if the workers can decide themselves how to organize. They don’t need bosses to shove them around, for they have the most experience of how things really work."
 
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Expand Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "The University of Bronzekreuz is still young, but it is expanding rapidly. Bronzehill needs new talent; it needs researchers, engineers, teachers and other professionals to be able to stand up to Griffenheim. We will put in another massive expansion round for the university, to hopefully attract new talent from back home and abroad."
 
 ### IDEAS ###
 # Industry
 BRZ_imperial_industry:0 "Imperial Owned Industry"
 BRZ_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Many griffons in Griffenheim have invested in Bronzehill, leaving very few local-owned mines, farms and factories. While this has helped develop Bronzehill's industrial capabilities, it has caused worry among locals who fear for their County's stability and soveignty. The issue will have to be addressed in some form, lest the whole nation ends up in the ownership of foreigners."
 # Military
 BRZ_pacifism:0 "Pacifism"
 BRZ_pacifism_desc:0 "Many of the nation's dog population can track their descent from escaped slaves, that fleed from the cruelty of their eastern cousins in Diamond Mountain. The Grover dynasty has accepted them with open claws, and while they are fierce defenders of the Emperor, they prefer to solve their issues with a peaceful and logical method."
 BRZ_underground_fortifications:0 "Underground Fortifications"

 # General Events
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger in the Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."

 # Industrial story events
 bronzehill_industrial.1.t:0 "The Ravensburg Dam"
 bronzehill_industrial.1.d:0 "For years, the dogs of Ravensburg had waited for this moment. The great dam near the city had finally been finished, half a year behind schedule. With it, the new industrial park, planned by Bronzekreuz and Griffenheim to provide over ten thousand new jobs in the area, could finally be powered. Many dogs and griffons had come to this momentous occasion, cheering when Count Ignatius Bronzetail cut the red band and gave the signal to start the turbines on the dam.\n\nHowever, among the wider political scene of Bronzehill, the whole project had been a rather contentious affair. While it was hard to deny that the industrial park, dubbed the \"Grover V Industrial Park\", would bring many opportunities for Bronzehill's shaken economy, it was also almost completely owned by various companies from Herzland, mostly from Griffenheim. The dam that powered the whole park was owned by Krähe-Stahl, a large industrial conglomerate from Griffenheim. The Socialist Party of Bronzehill had called the project an \"act of outright economic exploitation, supported by the government in Bronzekreuz\". The HKP and the NU had used slightly softer tones, but had likewise shown scepticism towards the planned ownership of the park. Among some circles, a future expropriation of these companies was already seen as inevitable.\n\nFar away, in an office in Griffenheim, several griffons toasted on the new project. They didn't find it necessary to personally come to Bronzehill, but they surely loved the thought about how many idols would flow into their deep, deep pockets."
 bronzehill_industrial.1.a:0 "Is this the future for Bronzehill?"
 
 bronzehill_industrial.2.t:0 "An Argument in the Family"
 bronzehill_industrial.2.d:0 "The door burst open and an angry looking Barnaby galloped into Ignatius' office. Ignatius looked up, calmly, but with a stern look on his face upon the sudden iterruption.\n\n\"Father, have you really signed EVEN MORE contracts with that maar-damned Krähe-Stahl?\" The crown prince fixated his father with his eyes, his anger and disappointment clearly visible. \"Bronzehill is becoming more and more a colony of these businessgriffs! Do you really think that the people will not notice? All the major parties condemned how the Grover V Industrial Park was organized, and here you are doing more of the same?\"\n\nIgnatius let out a sigh. \"My dear son and crown prince, even you are not allowed to burst into my office and yell at me. If I do something, I usually have a good reason for it. But I see from your look that perhaps you haven't gotten it.\" Ignatius pointed to a chair in front of the desk. \"So, please, sit down and listen. You will eventually come to rule this country, and so I should indeed explain this to you. Bronzehill's economy isn't doing well. You perhaps do not know the old prosperity, in the times of before the revolution tore everything asunder. Back then, Bronzehill was the blast furnace of the empire, with the forges of the dogs delivering the finest metals to every corner of it. The Bronzehillian economy was in excellent shape, one of the best of in these times. Then came the revolution, and everything fell apart. But these companies are interested in Bronzehill's ores. They want Bronzehill to once more become the forge of the empire, or what is left of it. We desperately need these investments. I will not bow to some dogs from the streets that seem to know everything better.\"\n\nBarnaby said nothing for a while, but he shook his head. \"I can tell you, father, the dogs from the streets have more power than you assume.\""
 bronzehill_industrial.2.a:0 "What price are we willing to pay?"
 
 # Introduction story events
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.t:0 "The Chairdogship"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius and crown prince Barnaby sat together in the drawing room of Bronzekreuz Castle. The old castle had been the residence of the Bronzetail family ever since Bronzehill was founded in 792 ALB and had been built partially underground. Diamond dogs had lived underground since time immemorial over in Diamond Mountain, and when the ancestors of Bronzehills population fled and found a new home here, they partially continued this tradition. The drawing room in the castle was one of the underground rooms, only dimly lit by the chandaliers on the ceiling.\n\n\"Barnaby, my son, as you are probably aware, I have decided to call the Bronzehill council. The crisis that has overtaken Griffenheim has severely impacted Bronzehill as well. Our nation mournes, as do we, therefore it is neccessary to show unity.\" Barnaby wagged his tail in approval. \"But this is not enough. I have also decided that you, my prince, should get the chairdogship in the council. It is only good if the people of Bronzehill see you take responsibility, and I think, you are ready for it.\"\n\n\"I see your point and agree with it. I will lead the council and look for that the council has only the best interest of Bronzehill in mind. Have you decided yet whom to invite?\"\n\nA servant brought in a plate of meatballs. Ignatius and Barnaby ate silently for a while, before Ignatius answered:"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.a:0 "\"No. I will need to arrange some meetings.\""
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.t:0 "The Old Reformer"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.d:0 "Ignatius had decided to meet Winston Copperhill in his club in Bronzekreuz. In one of back rooms of this club they could discuss political matters in a private atmosphere, far away from nosey listeners. The waiter of the club had brought them strong Hindian tea as well as a plate of ham slices, before being told to prevent anydog from entering.\n\nLord Winston Copperhill, 62 years old, widower and father of three, was an established figure in the political landscape of Bronzehill. Born in the better times of Grover IV, Copperhill saw the ineffective regency for Grover V with horror, before seeing everything collapsing in the revolution of 978. At the time, Copperhill had been a Hussar in Bronzekreuz Hussars. His regiment however did not saw fighting, but was tasked to protect Bronzehills cities. None-the-less, the revolution left a deep impression on Copperhill, who just a few years later decided to abandon him career in the army in favour of a political one. It was in part due to his influence that Count Georgie, Ignatius father, passed the \"Georgian reforms\", which introduced the city councils and allowed the formation of political parties, albeit with some restrictions. Copperhill immediately got to work, becoming a founding member of the Harmonic-Conservatives, the HKP. In 989, he became the second chairdog of the HKP, a role that he filled out dutifully for the last 18 years. As chairdog, he continued to advocate for both democratic and harmonic reform, calling for the establishment of a Bronzehillian parliament. The HKP under him also advocates for greater autonomy for Bronzehill, with Copperhill denouncing the businessgriffs investing in Bronzehill for their exploitative practices. In all of this, the Copperhill, nicknamed \"the old reformer\", had found a enthusiastic young follower, crown prince Barnaby, who was in turn nicknamed \"the young reformer\". Ignatius however had been wary of this friendship in the past, seeing the enthusiasm of his son for democracy with scepticism.\n\nAfter two hours of discussion, touching various political issues, Copperhill had secured a place for him and some of his party colleges in the Bronzehill Council. Ignatius did not tell him that Barnaby would be chairdog, and Copperhill had not mentioned it either, but the old dog probably already knew."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.a:0 "How much reform does Bronzehill need, and how much would break it?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.t:0 "An Usual Guest"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.d:0 "Bronzekreuz Castle may not have been the biggest castle, but it surely had its fair share of secrets. Barnaby had spent much of his youth exploring the secret rooms you could find in the underground parts of the castle, from unused wine cellars over rusty armouries to dilapidated meeting rooms, where you could find old war plans hanging on the walls. As a cub, this had been a lot of fun for him and his sister Margaret, but now it came in useful for more serious purposes. He had invited an usual guest into the castle, and they both had agreed that their conversation should better remain private.\n\nIn one of the old meeting rooms, Barnaby and Rosey Luxembark sat on old chairs around an even older table. Rosey Luxembark, 46 years old, was the current chairdog of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill (SPB). While her party was tolerated, if only barely, much of her writings had officially been banned from Bronzehill for \"inciting political violence\". Yet, for all the supposed radicalism, the SPB was still a special case in the socialist movement, for openly supporting the Griffenstone dynasty and the empire. However, Luxembark still envisioned a major shift in political power, as in her writings, she saw the monarchy in more of a figurehead position. The real power, she argued, should be vested in the workers, organized into workers councils and owning their workplaces. The worker councils should then be organized into a wider political party, which would form the national government. Luxembark also openly criticized the Archonates, as she saw them as not serving their communities, rather, she argued, the Archons demanded their communities to serve them, which she saw as an inversion of how things should be. Despite these ideas for grant political reform, she still saw a place for the nobles and archons to continue even in her vision, albeit only as figureheads. She claimed that this \"institutional continuity\" would serve the workers movement to stay away from radicalism and violence, which she condemned.\n\nBarnaby and Luxembark discussed the current prospects of the SPB and the workers movement. It had been Barnaby's idea that maybe Luxembark could also be invited into the Bronzehill council, to serve as a voice for the workers. Luxembark seemed open to the idea. The workers movement would still need the streets, but the council could serve as a good platform as well."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.a:0 "Barnaby and Luxembark parted in good spirit, but each with their own thoughts."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.t:0 "A Word with Loudbark"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.d:0 "It was quite unusual for the Count of Bronzehill to visit the barracks in Barkgenz, but Loudbark had ensured him that there they would find an opportunity to speak without needless listeners. However, while Ignatius had hoped to find Loudbark alone, apparently for the Unterwachtmeister his deputy Lassie Goldcoat did not count as such. But otherwise, Loudbark had kept his word, as he led Ignatius to a bunker just off the military area, where they could discuss undisturbed.\n\nRufus Loudbark, 29 years old and former Unterwachtmeister in the Garde-Artillerie-Regiment, was the chairdog of the National Union for the Salvation of Bronzekreuz, just called National Union (NU) for short. Despite his young age, he had already quite the time in the military, joining at just 18 years old as an infanterist in the guards. As simple soldier he joined the NU, back then mostly an organization in the military. However, his oratory skill had brought him far, and after taking the chairdogship of the NU three years ago the party has grown massively. Loudbark also swayed parts of the peasantry to his side, as well as a share of military minded nobles and even clergy, focusing on \"bread and butter\" issues. With choosing Lassie Goldcoat has his deputy, an escaped slave from Diamond Mountain and one of the few dogs without military background in leading positions, he further reinforced that image of the NU as a mass movement. However, in all of this, the NU has not abandoned its military ideals. The party still argues for the massive expansion of Bronzehills military, and also for greater autonomy from Griffenheim. In this regard Loudbark especially denounced the businessgriffs from the Herzland \"making profits off the common dog\".\n\nIgnatius was uneasy about Loudbark's influence on Bronzehill, but there was no denying that he was a rising star in the political scene. With some of the old nobles already supporting the NU, it would have its fair share of influence in the Bronzehill council."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.a:0 "Is militarism really an answer?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.t:0 "Up in the Hills"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.d:0 "The shack looked exactly how he remembered it, poor, dirty and generally in disrepair. How many years had it been? At least four, maybe five. Kimball Barking-Sun looked at his old home, here in the village he was born in. Kaza-Narag was not a special village, just one of many coal mining villages in the upper mountains of Bronzehill. Once a week large trucks arrived to carry away the coal mined, in exchange for food and other necessities. But they were never generous. How was this not slavery? Had they even escaped the mountain tyrant, the slaver of Diamond Mountain, or had they just exchanged his rule for that of his minions?\n\nBut Barking-Sun was not here for nostalgia. No, pressing issues were on the agenda. An opportunity how it could only ever happen once a century had opened. From his spies, Barking-Sun knew of the meeting between Luxembark and the crown prince. If Ignatius would dismiss Barnaby's proposal - which he would do, as minion of the mountain tyrant - Barking-Sun would finally find his opening to oust Luxembark as chairdog of the SPB and wrangle control of the party for himself. And then, the real task begun, namely to overthrow the rule of the nobles and archons in Griffenheim and to free Grover VI, for that he could embrace the spirit of his ancestor. Finally, the old wrong could be corrected, the misfortune of Grover II overcome. And if everything would go according to his plan, the rule of the mountain tyrant could finally be ended for good, with Grover VI leading the creatures of Griffonia to true liberty. Four Grovers later than it should have been.\n\nBut for all these lofty plans, he needed the support of the mining dogs. They knew him, and they trusted him. He had worked for years here, besides them, and he knew what steered them. Things would need to start moving, for if this change was missed, how long would it be before another one would present itself?"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.a:0 "Grover VI is our only hope in this world."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.t:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.d:0 "The temple of Boreas in Ravensburg shone in white marble. An impressive building, built around an ancient sacred altar for Boreas, and the home of the prelate for Bronzehill. Here, Ignatius was awaited by prelate Gunhild, a griffon priestess from Griffenheim, whom Erov VII had sent to oversee the parishioners of Bronzehill.\n\nThe Archonates was not overly strong in Bronzehill, but Gunhild had made the best of her position. She had positioned herself loyal to Ignatius and send her priests to praise the rule of the Bronzetail dynasty. Yet, she also tried to argue the case for Griffenheim, always trying to preach against the movements that demanded more autonomy for Bronzehill. With these messages, she had found Ignatius approval, and even though he was concerned about the influence of the archons in the wider empire, he deemed her at least an ideological ally. Gunhild was in particular concerned with the growing influence of the socialists, which she condemned as traitors to the gods. Gunhild had also done a lot to build good relations with the nobility of Bronzehill, and of course to Grandmaster Lucky, the Grandmaster of the Knights of Bronzekreuz. All this gave her some political sway, but she had never attempted to claim a more influencial political role.\n\nIgnatius and Gunhild sat in her residence. Gunhild had prepared some snacks herself, a great honour considering her status, and while eating they discussed the political developments. Ignatius had considered given her a seat in the council, but ultimately decided that it was best if the clergy would stay neutral. Maybe Gunhild had expected something, but she didn't ask."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.a:0 "Can we trust the clergy in times of need?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.t:0 "Finishing the List"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.d:0 "Like a few weeks prior, Ignatius and Barnaby sat in the drawing room of Bronzehill Castle. Before them was a long list, the collection of potentiall councillors. While Ignatius reserved himself the right to make the final call, he wanted to see what priorities his son would set, and so they vividly discussed each of the candidates. Most of the nobles on the list were set; they were too indispensable and pass over them would just be a political faux pass. Yet, with the political figures on the list, the choices weren't so clear. Both Copperhill and Loudbark had provided a number of candidates that they claimed to deserve a seat, but some of these names would need to be cut to not give the politicians to much power in the council.\n\nAs they argued, Barnaby also had a different thought in mind. It seemed almost inevitable that both the HKP and the NU would end up with the same number of councillors, just to save political face. And here he would need to argue to his father, as he know that Ignatius was also weary of Loudbark.\n\n\"Father, I want to bring a different idea on the table. I know that we are both concerned that Loudbark could sway the council into making decisions that... would be unpleasant to work with. But what if we brought in another candidate? Like Luxembark?\" Ignatius' ears pinned back upon hearing that name, but he didn't say anything. \"Including her and maybe one or two of her friends would make controlling Loudbark easier. And it would also serve as a much needed guesture to the working dogs of Bronzehill, that we have not forgotten they exist.\"\n\nBarnaby tried his best to tempt Ignatius to consider the idea, but Ignatius just fixated him with his eyes. After a while, Barnaby ran out of ideas of what to tell, and so they remained silent for a minute. Finally, Ignatius answered him:"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.a:0 "\"May I personally dislike her, maybe you have a point.\""

"News from Griffenheim... someone... someone..." the dog couldn't say more and Ignatius slowly took the letter, staring at the short message. He blinked, unable to understand the words at first. He read it over and over, as if it was written in a different language, but soon the paper fell from his paw. A... a coup? And the crown prince had been...\n\nHe unsteadily stood up, stumbling away form his desk. It couldn't be, that letter had to be wrong... it couldn't be! Not that too! Not that too! He screamed, howling in despair as he slammed his paws against the wall, pounding it furiously as he slowly sank down to his knees, whining incoherently. He didn't even comprehend what was going on as two guards came into the room, pulling him away from the wall as he kept slamming his now bleeding paws into it, nor could he understand them when they tried to reach through to him.\n\nIn the end, Count Ignatius was dragged out of his office and brought to the hospital, even as the news spread from the palace to the city and from the city to the country. Not enough that the emperor was dead, someone had murdered his son as well. The lineage of Grover, their savior, has gone, it was snuffed out, and in its place the military had taken control over in Griffenheim."

[BRZ.GetLeader] went so far as to suggest that Bronzehill should take the regency, claiming that the only beings who could truly rule the Empire justly in the name of the Emperor are those whose loyalty to the Emperor is unquestionable.\n\nGriffenheim and Strawberry have denounced the move as a great betrayal to the Empire."

Heavy casualties were mounting for the dogs as they did mass berserker charges against machine gun emplacements, however their ferociousness terrified Imperial soldiers with some deserting. Eventually, the dogs were able to penetrate deeper in the city thanks to continued artillery and air support. The dogs soon advanced from the outskirts to the center of the city until they reached the palace where the Imperial Guard fought ferociously before being killed thanks to the Guard refusing surrender. After the palace was taken, the dogs cheered as they secured the Emperor from the clutches of the Imperials holding him under their regency. Soon after, the remaining soldiers surrendered in mass in order to avoid their own deaths and were given fair treatment after the battle ended."

Eventually whatever remnants soon evacuated the city in small groups or deserted the frontlines from the harsh bloodshed and futility of fighting. In the end, the city was taken with heavy casualties by Bronzehill troops and was in ruins as well.

When he was five years old, he travelled to the Imperial City to see Grover V's coronation and was enamoured by the splendour. He returned to the city many times and studied there at Emperor's College, gaining a degree in politics.\n\nHe became a close friend of the Emperor, who attended his wedding to Izzy Bones-Iron, daughter of the Lord Gems. With her he has had two children, Barnaby and Margaret.\n\nDuring his rule he has been a competent administrator and a beloved defender of Bronzehill and the Emperor, however his policies on supporting Griffon industry over Bronzehill's own has led to the formation of several communist organisations in Bronzehill. And while he has the full support of the Bronze Council, there are those who question his ability to lead effectively should Bronzehill be faced by a disaster such as the Republican Uprising during his father's reign.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

His village was Dogish-speaking, something which is looked down upon in wider Bronzehill, and he recieved only token education as a child. At the age of 14 years, he started to work in the coal mines, where he formulated his ideology, based on a combination of folk stories and communist agitation which had spread into the mines. After joining a underground trade union, he learned to read and write in secret, while also becoming a local agitator and organizator.\n\nBarking-Suns political believes, especially with respect to the Griffonstone dynasty, are controversial among not only the wider socialist community (which rejects many of his views outright), but even inside of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill. However, through dedication and hard work, he has won his place in the party - and after overthrowing the \"liberal\" Luxembark, he can finally put his theory into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

Her father used his modest prosperity to enable Rosey and her five brothers to study in the prestigious universities of southern Herzland. Rosey enrolled to study economics, engineering, sociology and biology.\n\nDuring her studies, she became a socialist writer. She then decided to switch to study law, to work as lawyer and journalist for the socialist movement. Back in Bronzehill, she was a founding member of the Socialist Party, becoming its second chairman after August Barken. Among fellow socialists, her pro-monarchy views are a continuous topic of controversy, especially her idea of \"institutional continuity\" for achieving true communism. However, few griffons and dogs of Herzland can deny her commitment to the workers movement, democratic reform and socialist theory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

He quickly rose through the party ranks due to his oratory skill. After becomeing its chairdog in 1004, he has extended the party's platform and promoted the populist Lassie Goldcoat to be his deputy, appealing also to rural and nationalist dogs.

He was often controversial with his desire for social reform and his support of local Bronzehill businesses over Imperial ones. He was a founding member of the Harmonic Conservative Party and sort to bring greater representation of the common hound into the Bronze Council.\n\nDuring the Republican Uprising he was temporary promoted to Oberstleutnant, although did not participate in the fight to restore the Emperor to the throne. The event however convinced him that the only way to ensure the safety of the Emperor is to make Bronzehill strong and ready to fight. A rallying call that has put him at odds with many even in his own party. But his stubbornness and oratory talent have kept him at the forefront of politics.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Flake"
