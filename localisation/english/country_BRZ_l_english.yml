# General remarks for writers: 
# Please use International (Standard/Oxford) English, also called British English. Please do not use American English.
# As Bronzehill is a Herzlander (German) speaking nation, you might want to use some German words for flavour or immersion. Please do this rarely and only for single words that represent important concepts (examples: Volksreligion (= People's religion) for Luxembark or Wehrsportspiele (=Military/Defence sport games) for Loudbark). If you do not speak German, ping HerrB on discord to help you out.
# Some parts of Bronzehill speak also Dogish (Khuzdul). However, Dogish words should only be used exceptionally rarely, if at all. Please ping HerrB on discord to confirm that the lore fits. Please remember that Dogish is a minority language even among the dogs of Bronzehill, only spoken by ~25% of the population, with ~95% (also) speaking Herzlander.
# Thank you! - HerrB

 ## Industrial
 
 # Starting
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Finish The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The \"Grover V Industrial Park\" is the name given to large industrial park near Ravensburg. It is almost ready to be opened, but the dam to generate the electricity had been plagued by problems for the last month. It is time to put in the effort and finish this."
 
 BRZ_paving_the_roads:0 "Paving The Roads"
 BRZ_paving_the_roads_desc:0 "Now that the new industrial park is open, we have to make the most out of it. The roads around Ravensburg could use some better paving, so that goods can flow in and out of the industrial park. We will get to work."
 
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers:0 "Invite Griffenheim Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers_desc:0 "While the Grover V Industrial Park surely is a good investment, we need to be prepared for any future trouble. We will invite engineers from Griffenheim to work and live in Ravensburg, so that we can keep the park operational if a catastrophy like 978 would shake the empire again."
 
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Contracts With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "Why should we stop here? With the Grover V Industrial Park starting to be a success story, this can only mean good things for the Bronzehill economy. Our dear Count Ignatius will sign even more contracts will companies from Griffenheim."

 # Autonomist side
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Nationalize The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "It was utter insanity to allow the park to be operated in the way it was. Herzlander companies bought out more and more of the Bronzehillian economy, and our government only watched it happen. We will fix that, starting with the park itself."
 
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production:0 "Increase Domestic Food Production"
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production_desc:0 "In the past, most of Bronzehill's food was imported from wider Herzland, as we focused on mining and refining ores. With our trade relationships with other Herzland nations souring in the wake of our new political situation, we need to increase domestic production."
 
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy:0 "Diversify Bronzehill's Economy"
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy_desc:0 "Our economy needs to be able to stand more autonomous. It is not enough for us to focus on iron and steel anymore, if we can't reliably trade it for other goods. Our focus should be to diversify our industry, and luckily for us, the now nationalized Grover V industrial park can be used to do that."
 
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net:0 "Build A Social Safety Net"
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net_desc:0 "There is still a lingering economic crisis in Bronzehill, and many dogs still are destitute. Our help to these dogs will be doubly beneficial: Not only will we get more better fed, thus more productive workers, but also increased domestic demand, something that will help our economy to prosper again."
 
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust:0 "The Bronzehill Steel Trust"
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust_desc:0 "There are many steel producers in Bronzehill, and not a small amount of them are either still in the claws of businessgriffs or freshly nationalized. Yet, they are struggling as our exports are not doing great. Unifying them into a steel trust, the "Vereinigte Stahlwerke", will help us profit from our steel again."
 
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "Much of our steel industry is still held by private investors, both domestic and foreign. This can no longer stand! The workers demand that we give them control, so that the rich capitalists profit of their work no longer. Instead, the steel industry will be combined into the "Kombinat Kaza-Gull"."
 
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds:0 "Increase Engineering Funds"
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds_desc:0 "Our domestic production still suffers from a lack of industrial engineers. Our production methods are outdated, our industrial sectors run off old machinery and our output is trailing other nations in Herzland. Giving new funds to train and attract engineers can only help us here."
 
 BRZ_underground_factories:0 "Underground Factories"
 BRZ_underground_factories_desc:0 "Diamond dogs have a long history of living underground. While we in Bronzehill have partially adapted to the griffon way of live, we still can use the plenty of caves to create more room for factories. Coincidentally, these factories are also quite well protected against bombs from the air."
 
 BRZ_economic_planning_office:0 "Economic Planning Office"
 BRZ_economic_planning_office_desc:0 "For Bronzehill to have a strong and stable domestic industrial sector, we need to invest in proper management and planning. With the right ideas of land use, we can fetch some more factory locations from our limited lands."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_strong_and_free:0 "Bronzehill Strong And Free"
 BRZ_bronzehill_strong_and_free_desc:0 "With the reforms to our industry, we can proudly proclaim that Bronzehill no longer needs to hide about its industrial progress. Proudly we march into the future, free from foreign influence, strong from our own work."
 
 # Shared
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget:0 "Expand The Rural School Budget"
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget_desc:0 "Our education system still doesn't reach many of the small villages in Bronzehill, particularly in the mountains. Already under Count Georgie, the Rural School Program was initiated to alleviate the situation. Even though things have improved, the program still suffers from insufficient funding and a lack of teachers. It's high time to change that."
 
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers:0 "Invite Electronic Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers_desc:0 "One area where Bronzehill is particularly lacking is in the new and coming sector of electronics. If we want to improve our research, we need more talent in this sector."
 
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home:0 "Our Talents At Home"
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home_desc:0 "It would be wrong to entirely ignore what talent we already have at home. We are Diamond Dogs, not Griffons, and we should make use of what we are good at. New specialists should research about our own abilities, so that we can use them best."
 
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Found The Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "Bronzehill is so poor in scientist, that we don't even have our own domestic university. But with the recent influx of talent, attracted by our various programs, we finally have everything together to found our very own university for research and education, here in our capital."
 
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system:0 "Modernize The Education System"
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system_desc:0 "Our education system still suffers from being outdated on various topics. With new capacities to educate teachers here in Bronzehill, we should make sure that these teachers have all the tools they need and a up-to-date curriculum at paw."
 
 # Loyalty side
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl:0 "Negotiations With Krähe-Stahl"
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl_desc:0 "Now that the political situation is somewhat under control, we can resume our long task of resolving Bronzehill's economic crisis. A first step in this is to negotiate with Krähe-Stahl, one of the main operators of the Grover V Industrial Park."
 
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system:0 "Liberalize The Banking System"
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system_desc:0 "Bronzehill needs investment; there can be little doubt about that. To further our economic development, we will liberalize certain laws regarding credits and securities... hopefully this will convince some banks that we are worth an investment."
 
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth:0 "Give Support To Goldtooth"
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth_desc:0 "Max Goldtooth is one of the richest, if not the richest griffons in Bronzehill. Of course he is from Griffenheim and some dogs loath him for that. But he has built a large industrial conglomerate here, has invested more than a claw full of idols into the industrial district and most importantly, he is living in Bronzekreuz. Supporting his enterprises is good for us all."
 
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength:0 "Utilize Our Strength"
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength_desc:0 "Invest in your strength, and supplant your weaknesses, this should be our motto. Yes, we dogs are not as skilled in agriculture as other species might be, but we all the more skilled in our mining business that we are famous for. Let us use that."
 
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry:0 "Industrial Cooperation With Strawberry"
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry_desc:0 "In our new position, Strawberry is getting ever more important as trading partner. Several of their investors have shown interest in forming a group to organize their investment in Bronzehill. This is something we should further, so that our economy can profit."
 
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus:0 "Krähe-Stahl Bronzehill"
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus_desc:0 "Krähe-Stahl, the famous industrial conglomerate from Griffenheim, has agreed to officially open a branch office in Bronzekreuz. We will grant them large economic freedoms in exchange for steady investment."
 
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Expand The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park might have had a slow start, but it is now showing definite signs of success. The hydroelectric power from the Ravensburg dam is used almost completely, but this cannot stop us. We will expand the park by building new power plants."
 
 BRZ_foreign_investment_management_bureau:0 "Foreign Investment Management Bureau"
 BRZ_foreign_investment_management_bureau_desc:0 "The influx of foreign investment into Bronzehill is certainly helping us out quite a lot. But we need to keep track of who does what and for which purpose, otherwise we will end in economic chaos. Also, the investors still need to pay taxes to us."
 
 BRZ_urbanize_the_south:0 "Urbanize The South"
 BRZ_urbanize_the_south_desc:0 "The fertile strip of land in our south, from Hundsfeld to Ravensburg, is starting to become the economic lifeblood of Bronzehill. This is good, and we should encourage it, therefore we should expand the cities in the area."
 
 BRZ_prospering_together:0 "Prospering Together"
 BRZ_prospering_together_desc:0 "Bronzehill doesn't stand alone in Herzland, but is part of a vast network of trade routes and mutual investments. Good, we say! We shall prosper together with the rest of Herzland, just as all dogs within our nation also shall prosper together."
 
 BRZ_drill_for_oil_under_crownspike:0 "Drill For Oil Under Crownspike"
 BRZ_drill_for_oil_under_crownspike_desc:0 "Some unusual scents have been picked up by the noses of our skilled prospectors. While we are mostly concerned with gems and ores, this time we have struck oil. And in a changing industrial environment, oil is the new, black gold."
 
 ## Imperial Industrial
 
 BRZ_rebuild_the_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild The Imperial Economy"
 BRZ_rebuild_the_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "After our conquest of Griffenheim, the bureaucracy is in tatters. Our officials from Bronzekreuz work overtime, but an Empire requires an administration on an entirely different scale from a simple county."
 
 BRZ_political_background_checks:0 "Political Background Checks"
 BRZ_political_background_checks_desc:0 "It is quite clear that we will not be able to continue without incorporation at least some parts of the old administration into our ranks. But if we do so, we should tread carefully – we should not accidentally admit traitors into our ranks."
 
 BRZ_train_new_clerks:0 "Train New Clerks"
 BRZ_train_new_clerks_desc:0 "We need more people in our administration. Many jobs there don't require extensive training, we just need dog or griffons willing to work for us. Let us fill in these easier positions, then we can think about the higher-ups."
 
 BRZ_review_the_legal_codes:0 "Review The Legal Codes"
 BRZ_review_the_legal_codes_desc:0 "An orderly society needs clear legal codes, there can be little doubt about it. However, at the moment we have a total mess of legal structures, with Bronzehill statutes and old Imperial statutes all mixed together, and nocreature knows what actually applies."
 
 BRZ_construct_the_central_office:0 "Construct The Central Office"
 BRZ_construct_the_central_office_desc:0 "Here at the heart of the Empire in Griffenheim, we will put the heart of our administration. With this massive investment, we should be able to properly administer the Empire and enforce the will of the Emperor."
 
 BRZ_the_heart_of_the_heartlands:0 "The Heart Of The Heartlands"
 BRZ_the_heart_of_the_heartlands_desc:0 "If we wish to bind all industry of the Empire together, we need a strong industrial heart to support it. However, at the moment the area around our capital looks a bit lacklustre – something that we need to change."
 
 BRZ_the_imperial_high_speed_rail:0 "The Imperial High-Speed Rail"
 BRZ_the_imperial_high_speed_rail_desc:0 "A grand rail network for the Empire is not exactly a new idea – however, in the past any and all plans were foiled by unsupportive vassals, bureaucratic hassles or simply a lack of funding. Now, we have the technology and the will to finally realize the project on a large scale."
 
 BRZ_support_the_countryside:0 "Connect The Countryside"
 BRZ_support_the_countryside_desc:0 "The Imperial High-Speed Rail is a huge success, allowing for fast transportation of goods and people between major cities. However, many areas across the Empire have few towns and cities that could ever hope to have the IHSR come to them – we need to give them our support, too."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_food_supply:0 "Secure The Food Supply"
 BRZ_secure_the_food_supply_desc:0 "Our Empire is not only growing by its borders as we reconquer our rightful lands. As peace and prosperity return to our lands, we also experience a boom of cubs, pups and foals. We need to improve our farming further, so that our nation will never go hungry."
 
 BRZ_mass_motorization:0 "Mass Motorization"
 BRZ_mass_motorization_desc:0 "Motorization in the form of trucks and trains is important, both for our military and our population. But our motorization can go so much further. We need to build up industries to supply more engines, more cars and more trains."
 
 BRZ_revitalize_the_economy:0 "Revitalize The Economy"
 BRZ_revitalize_the_economy_desc:0 "The wars in Herzland and beyond have ravaged the economy of the Empire. As we rebuild the Empire, we likewise need to rebuild its economy, to secure our long-term strength."
 
 BRZ_our_natural_talent:0 "Our Natural Talent"
 BRZ_our_natural_talent_desc:0 "Diamond dogs are known for their ability to sniff out valuable metals and gems from the mountains. We also have a long tradition of famous techniques to create the best materials out of the mined ores. We will put these skills to good use by giving many dogs of Bronzehill leading positions in our resource extraction industry."
 
 BRZ_expedition_to_the_northern_mountains:0 "Expedition To The Northern Mountains"
 BRZ_expedition_to_the_northern_mountains_desc:0 "The mountains of Cloudbury and Sunstriker, while already being exploited for some minerals, still have great potential. An expedition of diamond dogs can show us were to dig - and we will dig, a lot."
 
 BRZ_new_industrial_centres:0 "New Industrial Centres"
 BRZ_new_industrial_centres_desc:0 "In order to facilitate even more economic growth, we will create specialized industrial hubs, focused on a single industry. These new industrial centeres will allow us to profit from an industry of scale to a formerly unknown extend."
 
 BRZ_imperial_gunforges:0 "Imperial Gunforges"
 BRZ_imperial_gunforges_desc:0 "To restore the rightful Empire of our beloved emperor, we will need a variety of military equipment. The Imperial Gunforge program is aimed at creating new high-efficiency mass factories, to produce everything from rifles to tanks and airplanes."
 
 BRZ_lights_of_griffonia:0 "Lights Of Griffonia"
 BRZ_lights_of_griffonia_desc:0 "The various great cities of Griffonia, like Griffonstone, Aquila or Kathrin have all been affected by the wars to reconquer the Empire. But we should rebuild these cities, better, greater, more shining than ever before, to demonstrate to the locals that they are truly part of the Empire – and that the Emperor has their best interests at heart."
 
 BRZ_the_imperial_passport:0 "The Imperial Passport"
 BRZ_the_imperial_passport_desc:0 "Passports are a relatively new phenomenon in the Herzlands. But as soon as they took off, local fiefdoms and administrations issued all sorts of passports or identification documents, creating a total mess. In an effort to massively simplify this bloated system, we will introduce the Imperial passport, to slowly replace all others."
 
 BRZ_standardized_measurement_system:0 "Standardized Measurement System"
 BRZ_standardized_measurement_system_desc:0 "The various lands that have found their way back into the Empire still use their local units of measurement. These local units introduce all kinds of barriers to trade and economic cooperation. To fix this, we will introduce a new, standarized measurement system build on new scientific understandings: The metric system."
 
 BRZ_support_the_electronic_industry:0 "Support The Electronic Industry"
 BRZ_support_the_electronic_industry_desc:0 "The various applications of electronic devices show that this technology has limitless potential. We need more industry to produce electronics, be it radios, artificial lights or electric engines.

 ## Military Initial
 
 BRZ_military_budget_review:0 "Review The Military Budget"
 BRZ_military_budget_review_desc:0 "The current crisis in the Empire has the potential to cause strife, if not outright war. While Bronzehill has traditionally maintained only a small army, the coming times could force us to change our approach quite drastically."
 
 BRZ_home_defence:0 "Home Defence"
 BRZ_home_defence_desc:0 "If Bronzehill should really get involved in a future war, we need to focus on defending our homes from the invaders. Let us prepare defensive plans on how we could stall any possible invading force."
 
 BRZ_western_defence_line:0 "Western Defence Line"
 BRZ_western_defence_line_desc:0 "The first step in our plan to protect Bronzehill is to build a defensive line running north to south, protecting Bronzekreuz and the lands behind it. The northern mountains would be used for defence, otherwise we will build behind the river."
 
 BRZ_southern_defence_line:0 "Southern Defence Line"
 BRZ_southern_defence_line_desc:0 "The southern defence line is for the worst case scenario – an attack from Griffenheim. Luckily, we can make use of the natural lakes and rivers, running a defence line from Pfotenhausen in the West through Hundsfeld and Ravensburg until we hit the Hellquillian border on the east."
 
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies:0 "Protecting Our Skies"
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies_desc:0 "The cruelties of air warfare are beginning to show themselves in the conflicts we hear about in the wider world. As we know that many nations that surround us are also building an air fleet, we need to invest in counter measures."
 
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat:0 "The Mountain Retreat"
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat_desc:0 "We dogs are people of the mountains. While many of our cities are built above the ground, every dog can still go underground if we need to. If our situation becomes really desperate, we can decide to move our administration away from the southern flatlands into the mountain, evacuating as many dogs and griffons as possible."
 
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy:0 "Challenge Our Legacy"
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy_desc:0 "The population of Bronzehill has always viewed war with horror. Violent behaviour was associated with the crimes of the Diamond Mountain slavers, something that was shunned in Bronzehill. However, we need to remind the dogs that someday the Emperor could call us to arms again – then we should not cower away."
 
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill:0 "The Army Of Bronzehill"
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill_desc:0 "We need to review the state of our current land forces. Their equipment is as outdated as their fighting tactics – we have a long way to go before our army is truly ready for combat."
 
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns:0 "Modernize Our Guns"
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns_desc:0 "The army of Bronzehill still operates with many old guns. We should do a concentrated effort to develop newer, more powerful guns, otherwise we will fall behind in combat capability."
 
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion:0 "Cannons Are Our Passion"
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion_desc:0 "Bronzehill is famous for its metals, and not too long ago, was also one of the prime producers of cannons for the empire. Yet, we have rarely used these guns for ourselves, nor have we produced them as much since the revolution. But we should get back on track."
 
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain:0 "Our Natural Terrain"
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain_desc:0 "As diamond dogs, we live in the mountains – literally in the mountains sometimes. As such, we have developed a very fine sense of how to operate here. If our enemies can't counter this, we should use it."
 
 BRZ_proper_support_for_our_troops:0 "Proper Support For Our Troops"
 BRZ_proper_support_for_our_troops_desc:0 "With storm troops alone we won't be able to overcome the enemy. Our divisions also need various supporting elements, like engineers, field hospitals or reconnaissance. We should focus on including these in our division, to maximize efficiency."
 
 BRZ_cannons_on_wheels:0 "Cannons On Wheels"
 BRZ_cannons_on_wheels_desc:0 "Other nations have already done it, and we should follow soon: Putting our cannons on top of mightily armoured vehicles. This way, we can have firepower that is much more flexible when approaching the enemy."
 
 BRZ_rework_our_training_routine:0 "Rework Our Training Routine"
 BRZ_rework_our_training_routine_desc:0 "In peace times, it is all too common for our troops to become complacent. And for good reason, for the longest time they were just a better police force. However, now we need well trained, combat-ready soldiers, so we need to intensify our training."
 
 BRZ_update_our_tactics:0 "Update Our Tactics"
 BRZ_update_our_tactics_desc:0 "One of the most crucial things in combat is to employ the right tactics. This mostly comes with experience, however by studying the wars around us in the world, we might still be able to learn quite a bit of useful insight."
 
 BRZ_bronzehills_special_recipe:0 "Bronzehill's Special Recipe"
 BRZ_bronzehills_special_recipe_desc:0 "When the enemies approach our tanks, they will soon notice why we are called diamond dogs. No other species can claim to be so good at treating metals as we are."
 
 BRZ_electronic_support:0 "Electronic Support"
 BRZ_electronic_support_desc:0 "The advancements made in electronics have certainly impacted the way future wars will be fought. The newest invention is the so-called RADAR technology which would help us to spot enemy forces in advance. We should invest in it."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad:0 "A Bronzehill Air Squad"
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad_desc:0 "We dogs have not a natural ability to fly like the griffons do, but all the more should we be interested in the developments of airplanes. Let us establish a Bronzehill air squad by procuring a few airplanes from friendly sources in Herzland."
 
 BRZ_upgrade_our_fighters:0 "Upgrade Our Fighters"
 BRZ_upgrade_our_fighters_desc:0 "While we have procured some fighters from abroad, and also have the knowledge of building more, our fighters still don't do well in comparison to what others armies can field. An investment into research on various components will seriously enhance the capabilities of our fighters."
 
 BRZ_bombs_from_above:0 "Bombs From Above"
 BRZ_bombs_from_above_desc:0 "To be able to drop bombs on our enemies from above is an incredibly powerful tool, if used right. We need to further our knowledge on the components involved, so that our enemies may shiver in fear when they see our bombers approach."
 
 BRZ_bronzehills_air_factories:0 "Bronzehill's Air Factories"
 BRZ_bronzehills_air_factories_desc:0 "To further our air force, we need additional capabilities to building more planes. A new industrial project centred on producing planes can deliver what our army needs."
 
 BRZ_dogs_doing_dogfights:0 "Dogs Doing Dogfights"
 BRZ_dogs_doing_dogfights_desc:0 "For some unknown reason, if two pilots fight each other in the air, it is known as a "dog fight". Well, this should spurn us to become the undisputed master of these dog fights, then."

 BRZ_the_new_reichsarmee:0 "The New Reichsarmee"
 BRZ_the_new_reichsarmee_desc:0 "We have taken Griffenheim, and now we are the loyal regents of the great Emperor. But the old framework of the Bronzehill army is proving more and more insufficient – we need to reconstitute our army as the one, true Reichsarmee."

 BRZ_an_unusual_guest:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest_desc:0 "Count Ignatius is not the only one who is interested in potential councillors. Barnaby had an idea of his own, and has invited an unusual guest into Bronzehill Castle, to discuss some things that Ignatius doesn't need to know about - for now at least."
 
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark is the chairdog of the militarist and populist National Union, and fully lives up to his name. But in this matter, Count Ignatius preferes a more calm environment, for some things need to be discussed discretely."
 
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills:0 "Up In The Hills"
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills_desc:0 "Not all power in Bronzehills comes from the palace. Even though the Count rules absolute, there are plenty of dogs who hold little loyalty to him. And one of them had just found out very interesting details to think about."
 
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg_desc:0 "The prelate of Bronzehill, located in Ravensburg, is normally only concerned with religious matters. However, in times when the socialist movement openly defies the will of Boreas, it is hard to stay out of politics."
 
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas:0 "Barnaby's Ideas"
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas_desc:0 "The final list of councillors is almost complete. All the political factions in Bronzehill have found their place in the council. Or have they? Crown Prince Barnaby think that Ignatius has forgotten something, but Barnaby has already an idea."

 BRZ_the_councils_opens_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council has been called.

 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile:0 "The Regent In Exile"
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has become regent in Griffenheim, much to the dismay of the nobility, including Count Ignatius.

 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter:0 "Trip To Readewetter"
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter_desc:0 "If we want to support Gabriela in overthrowing the Archon and taking the regency, we need to formalize our alliance as soon as possible. Count Ignatius will personally travel to Readewetter to meet Gabriela and to discuss further details."
 
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp:0 "Work With The HKP"
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp_desc:0 "In contrast to the radicals from the Socialists or the National Union, the Harmonic-Conservatives are not a fundamental thread to Bronzehill.

 BRZ_purge_the_high_command:0 "Purge The High Command"
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command_desc:0 "The high command has shown a disturbingly close relationship with Loudbark's National Union. In the current political climate, these connections could easily become a thread to our rule. We will retire the worst offenders, while promoting new staff from the loyal nobility."
 
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate:0 "Help From The Prelate"
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Gunhild is not too happy that we have thrown our support behind Gabriela – as appointee from Eros, she argued in favour of his regency.

 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights:0 "Loyalty Of The Knights"
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights_desc:0 "Much like Gunhild, Grandmaster Lucky from the Knights of Bronzekreuz has shown a preference for Eros.

 BRZ_gather_noble_support:0 "Gather Noble Support"
 BRZ_gather_noble_support_desc:0 "The nobles of Bronzehill are the fundament of our rule, now more than ever. Yet a surprising amount of nobles seems to be rather passive, instead of openly supporting the Count. We have to remind them of what is at stake here."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_desc:0 "With our rule secured, we can finally proclaim the crisis to be over and send the councillors home. They have been an obstacle to our goals for long enough."
 
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry:0 "Trade With Strawberry"
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry_desc:0 "After we have favoured Gabriela over Eros, our trade with Griffenheim has predictably taken a hit. However, our alliance with Strawberry also includes various economic treaties. It is high time we act on these treaties and bring our economy back on track."
 
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts:0 "Renegotiate Industrial Contracts"
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts_desc:0 "At the time we negotiated with Krähe-Stahl and other companies from Griffenheim over future investment in Bronzehill, nodog could have seen coming that we would break with Griffenheim. But it has happened, and now we have to secure our economy. We will approach them to renegotiate some of the clauses in our investment pacts."

 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares:0 "Shuffle Industrial Shares"
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares_desc:0 "Not all companies that we have investment agreements with are from Griffenheim. In fact, a fair share of them is from Strawberry, which already is one of the richer parts of Herzland. With some targeted laws and regulations, we will shift our support to the companies that are compatible with our new alignment."
 
 BRZ_in_defence_of_tradition:0 "In Defence Of Tradition"
 BRZ_in_defence_of_tradition_desc:0 "It is important to remember for every dog that we fight for a just cause: Against theocratic radicalism and for the trusted rule of the nobility. We will spread the message across Bronzehill, so that every dog can see why we stand against Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors:0 "Invite Yale Professors"
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors_desc:0 "Bronzehill's academia is quite small in comparison to the intellectual centres in Herzland.

 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim:0 "Envoy To Griffenheim"
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "We have thrown our full support behind the rightful regent, but this does not solve our political crisis at home yet. When we send an official envoy to Griffenheim it will not only show the empire our admiration, but also serve as a warning to our political opponents at home."
 
 BRZ_gather_the_knights:0 "Gather The Knights"
 BRZ_gather_the_knights_desc:0 "Grandmaster Lucky of the Knights of Bronzekreuz has already expressed interest in taking on the problem with the socialists in our country. We have long been hesitant, but in our new situation, we need decisive action. Grandmaster Lucky can deliver that."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility:0 "Unite The Nobility"
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility_desc:0 "We should not forget that a fair few nobles in the council seemed to favour the notion of a Bronzehill regency. But now that the matter is decided, we need to unite the nobles behind us. Division makes us weak in the face of our political opponents that still hide in the shadows."
 
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies:0 "Clear Military Hierachies"
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies_desc:0 "One of the most pressing issues for us is the loyalty of the army – Loudbark seems to have infiltrated the army rather successfully. We should ask in Griffenheim for some army advisors, which would bolster our command structure and coincidentally also make it secured against a future takeover attempt."
 
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB:0 "Outlaw The SPB"
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB_desc:0 "This farce has been going on for long enough. We have tried to handle the socialist movement by making some reforms while banning their more dangerous ideas, yet it has not come to fruition. Now, we will make the hammer come down and outright ban the Socialist Party."
 
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages:0 "Spread Loyalist Messages"
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages_desc:0 "Every dog should know that what we aspire to is to help and support the emperor. This is the least common denominator for every dog in Bronzehill, and we will base our propaganda efforts on it. The idea of a Bronzehill-led regency is just crazy-talk by dangerous people."
 
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim:0 "Invite Advisors From Griffenheim"
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim_desc:0 "Bronzehill's industry is still lacking, and the ongoing political crisis has shaken our administration as well.

 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist_desc:0 "The crisis is over, finally. The Bronzehill Council has been a thorn in our side instead of being helpful, but now we have gathered enough political strength to send them home. Boreas bless them, and farewell."
 
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity:0 "A True Show Of Unity"
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council was originally intendent to show the united support of the dogs for the emperor. This worked rather mediocre, to be polite. However, with the political crisis over, we are finally ready to unite behind the emperor and his regent. Our bond will never be broken."
 
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs:0 "Most Loyal And Faithful Dogs"
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs_desc:0 "The newfound unity of the dogs will also make itself known in the army. If we fight, we fight for the emperor, and we will fight proudly under his flag."
 
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim:0 "Reinvigorate Trade With Griffenheim"
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim_desc:0 "Despite our strong bonds, the economic relation with Griffenheim has been lacking lately, mostly due to their own economic troubles. But with the empire slowly getting back on track, our trade relationship should deepen again. If we do it right, Bronzehill's economy will gain a good boost out of this."
 
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park:0 "The Grover V Memorial Park"
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park_desc:0 "Grover V was truly a great emperor. A grand park in Bronzekreuz will be constructed to honour and remember him. This will both serve as a nice addition to our city, being a place to relax and enjoy, and also as a reminder for all dogs that we are the most loyal subjects of his majesty."
 
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire:0 "The Forge Of The Empire"
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire_desc:0 "In the old times, before it all came crashing down in the revolution, Bronzehill was known as the "Forge of the Empire". We dogs are well versed in how to extract and refine the treasures of the earth, be it metals or gems. While we might have a long way to go before our old glory can be reclaimed, we will make our efforts known."

 BRZ_barking_suns_coup_desc:0 "With the Bronzehill Council in deadlock, Barking-Sun has finally made his move and overthrown the government with the help of his loyal mining dogs. The Count has fled, but resistance to our rule remains. Our great task begins here."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_army:0 "Secure The Army"
 BRZ_secure_the_army_desc:0 "The Army is the institution most hostile to our new government. But when Barking-Sun can appeal to the mining dogs, he can also sway the common soldier. As for the commanders... we need to destroy the old command structure of the army as quickly as possible, to secure a future for our regime."
 
 BRZ_target_the_national_union:0 "Target The National Union"
 BRZ_target_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is our greatest political enemy. Now that we have taken control of Bronzekreuz, we can finally move to destroy them once and for all. Down with the reaction!"
 
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp:0 "Disband The HKP"
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp_desc:0 "The Harmonic-Conservative Party is a group of weaklings, pseudo-reformers and double-faced reactionaries. Their claims of peace and liberty are lies to deceive the working class, for they want to keep the old oppressors in their lofty positions. Our revolution has made them terrified, and rightfully so: They are the next to go."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge The Nobles"
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have already seen from where the wind is blowing and have abandoned their estates. However, others are fighting in the shadows or openly defy our rule. Here, any temperance would be our downfall, we have to strike fast and hard."
 
 BRZ_hunt_the_count:0 "Hunt The Count"
 BRZ_hunt_the_count_desc:0 "Ignatius, the old Count of Bronzehill, has fled the capital as our revolution broke out.

 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy:0 "Mobilize The Economy"
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy_desc:0 "We have the high goal of marching on Griffenheim and saving Grover VI from his ill advisors and deceptive nobles. However, for that we need guns, cannons and other war material. We will have to fully mobilize the economy of Bronzehill and Barking-Sun has just the right ideas on how to do it."
 
 BRZ_liberation_corps:0 "Liberation Corps"
 BRZ_liberation_corps_desc:0 "The ''Befreiungskorps'' (Liberation Corps) are special units staffed with only the most loyal supporters of Barking-Sun, mostly his old comrades from the mines. They will be essential for conquering Griffenheim. May they live up to their name!"
 
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication:0 "Principle Of Total Dedication"
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication_desc:0 "The Principle of total dedication is quite simple: Everything for the emperor. We work, fight and die for him. There can no thought but his liberation on our minds. This is our duty, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_industrial_independence:0 "Industrial Independence"
 BRZ_industrial_independence_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill is still entangled in trade with Griffenheim and other parts of Herzland. With nothing but traitors to the emperor surrounding us, we cannot accept this, but we need to work extra hard to ensure our industrial independence."
 
 BRZ_new_academia:0 "New Academia"
 BRZ_new_academia_desc:0 "The academic system of Bronzehill needs a total makeover. We need to focus our research efforts on the things that matter to us, namely how to best defeat the false regent in Griffenheim. Otherwise, we need to cull research that is not on our political line."
 
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy:0 "Barking-Sun's Philosophy"
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy_desc:0 "Barking-Sun is not much of an academic writer, but he surely has a clear view of the world. With the help of some academic that have proven their loyalty, Barking-Sun will publish a book for every good dog to carry around. As it is printed with a red cover, it will soon enough be known as the ''little red book''."
 
 # Luxembark path
 
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate:0 "The Outsider Candidate"
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate_desc:0 "To the surprise of everyone, Rosey Luxembark has won the race for chancellorship. The more established political parties are still in utter confusion how she got here, but our new government has a clear task: To reform Bronzehill so that the workingdogs can finally take their fair share."
 
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs:0 "A Government For The Workingdogs"
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs_desc:0 "The SPB always was the true defender of working rights in Bronzehill. We have stood up for the common dog when others hid behind promises of reform or populist lies. Now that we have the strings of power in our paws, we can truly bring forth a government for the workingdogs."
 
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles:0 "Curtail The Nobles"
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have reacted with concern to Luxembark's chancellorship, with some even calling for openly resisting her rule. With cannot stand.

 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws:0 "Reverse The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "For a long time, the operations of the SPB and the socialist movement were hamstringed by a series of laws dubbed the ''socialist laws'', which outlawed our organizations and writings. However, with this, the reactionaries have set a legal precedent, which we can now turn on its head. From now on, reactionary propaganda is banned in Bronzehill."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union:0 "Purge The National Union"
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is a collection of militarists, reactionaries and imperialists, in short, the anti-thesis to our government. And of course, their chairdog Rufus Loudbark has tried to turn the army against our government ever since it came to be. But with the new anti-reactionary laws at paw, we can finally shatter their movement."
 
 BRZ_replace_the_count:0 "Replace The Count"
 BRZ_replace_the_count_desc:0 "Until now, Count Ignatius has accepted our government, if only barely. However, there can be little doubt that he intends to overthrow our government as soon as he gets the opportunity. While Rosey Luxembark does not intend to abolish the monarchy, we could just force Ignatius to abdicate in favour of Barnaby, who is much less of a threat to our government."
 
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils:0 "Introduce Worker Councils"
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils_desc:0 "One of the key program points is the establishment of worker councils, which would serve as a democratic root for the socialist party. However, let us not put our hind paws in the front. For now, the worker councils will not directly take over the economy, but serve as counsel for the factory workers."
 
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs:0 "Expropriate The Oligarchs"
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs_desc:0 "The businessgriffs from Herzland, but also various domestic nobles and businessdogs have formed an oligarchical power structure that controls Bronzhill's economy.

 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog:0 "March Of The Working Dog"
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog_desc:0 "The ''March of the Workingdogs'' is a famous political song from Bronzehill, adapted by us as the new anthem. United we stand, for the common good. Singing this song, we will march on Griffenheim and bring forth a new era of socialist cooperation and workers democracy."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry:0 "Sway The Peasantry"
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The agrarian population of Bronzehill is large and consists of many destitute dogs and griffons. Yet, they have not heart our call and stayed apathetic to our government's reforms. We have to go on the offensive and listen to their issues, so that the every dog can stand united."
 
 BRZ_worker_self_organization:0 "Worker Self-Organization"
 BRZ_worker_self_organization_desc:0 "First results from the expropriation of nobles are in, and the results are astounding. It is clear that factories work better if the workers can decide themselves how to organize. They don't need bosses to shove them around, for they have the most experience of how things really work."
 
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Expand Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "The University of Bronzekreuz is still young, but it is expanding rapidly. Bronzehill needs new talent; it needs researchers, engineers, teachers and other professionals to be able to stand up to Griffenheim. We will put in another massive expansion round for the university, to hopefully attract new talent from back home and abroad."
 
 # Barnaby path
 
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby:0 "Give Power To Barnaby"
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby_desc:0 "With Copperhill's ascendance to chancellorship, our country is now on the track of democratic and harmonic reform. Given Barnaby's close relationship with him in the past, it is best for our nation if Ignatius would step down and pass the crown to the crown prince, something that he has agreed to do."
 
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists:0 "Negotiate With The Socialists"
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists_desc:0 "The radicals from the SPB have expressed their discontent with our reform agenda and agitate against us with their radical slogans. However, the SPB also has a rather large faction of moderates, which could be won over if we prove ourselves as genuine reformers. We will listen to their demands,  as when they switch sides, the rest of the SPB will sink into irrelevance."
 
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws:0 "Labour Reform Laws"
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws_desc:0 "Our promises to the progressives and moderate socialists should not stay empty, or otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble once more. But our labour reforms are not socialist in nature, but aim to create a more just, equal and harmonious society."
 
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda:0 "Start The Reform Agenda"
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda_desc:0 "The list of problems in Bronzehill is long, and so is the list our planned reforms. With Barnaby and Copperhill at the helm, we can finally make our dreams of a better Bronzehill into a reality. Our first step is to formalize our rule by creating a cabinet with clear administrative responsibilities."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles:0 "Sway The Nobles"
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have looked with concern on all of our promises, as they fear that we will come after their privileges. And this is true, to some extent. Yet, we have to make it clear to them that this is the best they can hope for anyways. In this modernizing world, a society build purely on nobles is weak, as proven by the revolution of 978."
 
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union:0 "Undermine The National Union"
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union_desc:0 "The last place we have to bring to our side is the army. Loudbark has a tight grip on the soldiers, but our reform agenda will improve their lives too. We will go to the barracks to tell and listen, so that hopefully they will abandon their radicalism for our harmony."
 
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Deal With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "There is no way of putting it mildly: These businessgriffs, whether from Griffenheim or somewhere else in Herzland, are a stain on Bronzehill's economy and we need to do something about them. Although large-scale nationalizations run against our party principles in general, in this case there is simply no way around it."
 
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections:0 "New City Council Elections"
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections_desc:0 "Until now, the city councils were elected under a census suffrage system, where only middle and upper class residents could vote. However, we have now abandoned this system in favour of a true universal suffrage, and it is time to put this new law into practice. New city council elections will be held, open to everyone."
 
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice:0 "Our Cause For Justice"
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice_desc:0 "When we march against Griffenheim, it is not out of treason to the empire, no, it is rather in the desire to bring true justice, harmony and equality to the empire as a whole. Grover needs a good regent, who can reform the empire, not selfish nobles or lunatic theocrats."
 
 BRZ_domestic_investments:0 "Domestic Investments"
 BRZ_domestic_investments_desc:0 "Bronzehill's economy is still very weak. We need to reinvest whatever money we have, so that our economy backbone is strong enough to survive the coming troubles."

 BRZ_unite_the_reformers_desc:0 "There are many reform minded dogs and griffons in Bronzehill. With the recent council elections, we have proven to them that we are not here to talk, but to take action. We stand for what we say, and if the support us, it will not be in vain."

 BRZ_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
 BRZ_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark has claimed the chancellorship.

With the military at the forefront, our greatness is secured."
 
 BRZ_sharpen_the_socialist_laws:0 "Sharpen The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_sharpen_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "The Socialist Laws were an approach by Ignatius and his supporters to curtail the socialist movement without actually banning it. What a nonsense approach! We will solve this issue once and for all, and as a first step we will ban all remaining socialist organizations, including the SPB."
 
 BRZ_expand_rural_subsidies:0 "Expand Rural Subsidies"
 BRZ_expand_rural_subsidies_desc:0 "We cannot forget any of our supporters. Yes, the army is our main strength, but without the peasants who proudly stood against socialist agitation, we would not be where we are now. In return, we will set up new subsidies for the peasantry."
 
 BRZ_our_city_reforms:0 "Our City Reforms"
 BRZ_our_city_reforms_desc:0 "The National Union believes in democracy, we really do. However, this democracy cannot get in the way of an orderly and secure society. We will drop the census suffrage currently used by the city councils, but in turn we will ensure that only trusted candidates can stand in the council elections."
 
 BRZ_using_the_army:0 "Using The Army"
 BRZ_using_the_army_desc:0 "The army is our greatest asset, and exactly the right tool to use against the remaining socialist agitators. We will raid their hiding spots and fight their street gangs. Let's see how their puny ''militias'' will do against our armoured cars."
 
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act:0 "The Nationalization Act"
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act_desc:0 "The assets of the various Herzland companies in Bronzehill are nothing short of foreign meddling in our affairs. These businessgriffs seem to think that just because they invested a few idols they get to decide what ''their'' companies should produce or who they should employ. Well, only one solution then."
 
 BRZ_approach_the_nobles:0 "Approach The Nobles"
 BRZ_approach_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have opposed Loudbark for a long time, seeing his ideas as hazardous and populist. But the situation has changed. No longer is it about gaining political power, it is now about coming to terms with the new reality. Some nobles have already endorsed Loudbark, and we now have to convince the rest of them."
 
 BRZ_the_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 BRZ_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Our industry and our army need to be in close cooperation. After all, what is all that industry for, if not to produce what our armies need? Sure, we also need various goods for the dogs of our nation, but this is only so that these dogs can serve as soldiers, right?"
 
 BRZ_unleash_the_dogs_of_war:0 "Unleash The Dogs Of War"
 BRZ_unleash_the_dogs_of_war_desc:0 "As escaped slaves, Bronzehill has a pacifist history. For a long time, we saw war as something that would bring only harm and suffering. However, the recent changes we have made start to effectively challenge that mind-set.  If we do it right, we can unleash the dogs of war, that they may rescue the emperor."
 
 BRZ_militarization_of_the_police:0 "Militarization Of The Police"
 BRZ_militarization_of_the_police_desc:0 "What is the police for? They are your friend and helper, sure, but they are also to keep our society in order and devious elements in check. And for that, they need proper equipment and training. We will give them better guns, armoured cars and wide ranging authority to fulfil their duty."
 
 BRZ_build_the_hundsfeld_military_academy:0 "Build The Hundsfeld Military Academy"
 BRZ_build_the_hundsfeld_military_academy_desc:0 "So far, Bronzehill has no military academy of its own.

 # General Events
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger In The Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."
 bronzehill.1.a:0 "No, please no. Please..."

 bronzehill.2.t:0 "The Flower Gems"
 bronzehill.2.d:0 "It is a Diamond Dog tradition, that in the event of a death, the family and friends of the deceased are expected to gather a bouquet of precious stones known as flower gems. These stunning rocks are then crafted into a beautiful display which adorns the deceased's grave and acts as a reminder of how much they were loved and cherished.\n\nIn the wake of Grover's death, the dogs of Bronzehill have begun a migration to the capital. Each of them depositing their own collection of gems at the count's palace. Within a day this collection was impressive, within a week it was majestic, now it's overwhelming.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has commissioned the greatest artisans of the county to work together and manufacture these gems into a grand display of our dogs' devotion to the emperor. Already this display has begun to take shape, composed of a beautiful statue of Grover's likeness with a base that houses a mural which promotes the Emperor's many accomplishments.\n\nAs it nears completion, we must decide if we should send this to Griffenheim, as a solemn gift to Grover VI, or if it should remain in Bronzekreuz as a monument to our devotion and loyalty to the crown."
 bronzehill.2.a:0 "Send it to Griffenheim."
 bronzehill.2.b:0 "Display it in Bronzekreuz."

 bronzehill.3.t:0 "Bronzehill Sends a Gift"
 bronzehill.3.d:0 "In the wake of the emperor's death, our vassals in Bronzehill have presented us with a truly beautiful gift. It is a part of Diamond Dog culture, that in the event of a death, the dogs close to deceased will gather gemstones, known as flower gems, and sculp them into a memorial.\n\nThese dogs have remembered their loyalty to the crown well and have submitted their gift, crafting a truly impressive statue of Grover V constructed out of precious gems gathered by hundreds of thousands of the county's citizens.\n\nMany have called for us to place this statue in the imperial mausoleum as a sign of our gratitude for this cherished gift. While it would no doubt be a glorious addition to the emperor's tomb, it can not be ignored that this statue would fetch a rather high price amongst art collectors with the money helping to stabilise our budget."

 bronzehill.4.t:0 "Griffenheim Accepts our Gift"
 bronzehill.4.d:0 "Our gift to the imperial court has been graciously accepted with our statue being proudly displayed within the hallowed grounds of the imperial mausoleum. For generations to come, many will pass through those chambers and see our contribution to Grover V's memory presented front and centre.\n\nA thank you letter from Grover VI was received by Count Ignatius Bronzetail. In it, the young emperor thanks both the Count and his subjects for their lovely gift and he assures us all that our devotion has made these troubled times easier.\n\nIt's rumoured that the Count had this letter framed and displayed within his personal office."
 bronzehill.4.a:0 "May our bond with Griffenheim never waver."

 bronzehill.5.t:0 "Insult from Griffenheim"
 bronzehill.5.d:0 "For days, the status of our memorial to Grover V has been left in limbo. We knew for a fact that it was received in Griffenheim but information on its whereabouts weas left fuzzy as soon as it was tranfered to imperial officials. Days passed and there was no official word from the imperial court.\n\nHowever, a leading Griffenheim capitalist recently hosted a memorial ball, which our ambassador attended. In his report, our ambassador states that he discovered that our memorial was not only in the possession of this capitalist but that he had purchased it from government officials for a considerable amount of money.\n\nWhen pressured, the imperial court failed to provide a statement."

 # Industrial story events

 bronzehill_industrial.1.d:0 "For years, the dogs of Ravensburg had waited for this moment. The great dam near the city had finally been finished, half a year behind schedule. However, for now the dogs and griffons of Ravensburg celebrated the opening with large fair. Under pompous fanfare, Count Ignatius cut the red band and ceremoniously gave the signal to start operations.\n\nThe next days, the news all over the country reported about the event. Woofrey Pawner was standing in front of a kiosk and read through the headlines: "Industrial Park operational! Huge Progress for Ravensburg!" (Bronzekreuzer Bote) - "Ravensburg's Industrial Park at work! New opportunities available" (Bronzehügeler Wirtschaftswoche) - "Ravensburg dam opened! How will this affect Bronzehill?" (Harmonisches Morgenblatt) - "New Industries in Ravensburg - but all from Griffenheim" (Nationaler Beobachter) - "Count Ignatius' newest scheme in operation. But will it help him?" (Der Arbeiter). He shook his head. How could they all have so different opinions on the matter? He decided that these scribblers weren't worth this money and moved on.\n\nFar away, in an office in Griffenheim, several griffons toasted on the new project. They hadn't found it necessary to personally travel to Bronzehill, but they surely loved the thought about how many idols would flow into their deep pockets."

The Count looked up, calmly, but with a stern look on his face upon the sudden interruption.\n\n"Father, have you really signed EVEN MORE contracts with that maar-damned Krähe-Stahl?" The Crown Prince fixated his father with his eyes, his anger and disappointment clearly visible. "Bronzehill is becoming more and more a colony of these businessgriffs! Do you really think that the people will not notice? All the major parties condemned how the Grover V Industrial Park was organized, and here you are doing more of the same?"\n\nIgnatius let out a sigh. "My dear son and crown prince, even you are not allowed to burst into my office and yell at me. If I do something, I usually have a good reason for it. But I see from your look that perhaps you haven't gotten it." Ignatius pointed to a chair in front of the desk. "So, please, sit down and listen. You will eventually come to rule this country, and so I should indeed explain this to you. Bronzehill's economy isn't doing well. You perhaps do not know the old prosperity, in the times of before the revolution tore everything asunder. Back then, Bronzehill was the blast furnace of the empire, with the forges of the dogs delivering the finest metals to every corner of it. The Bronzehillian economy was in excellent shape, one of the best of in these times. Then came the revolution, and everything fell apart. But these companies are interested in Bronzehill's ores. They want Bronzehill to once more become the forge of the empire, or what is left of it. We desperately need these investments. I will not bow to some dogs from the streets that seem to know everything better."\n\nBarnaby said nothing for a while, but he shook his head.

Even more, he also had to carry the bag with his personal belongings, as he would probably not return to Hundsfeld for the next couple of months. But his new job as teacher here in the peaks payed quite well, so at least he would be able to afford a nice vacation once it was over.\n\nWhatever he had expected of the village, it was worse than he imagined. How could these dogs live in their caves without sunlight for so long? And these houses... they truly were more shacks than proper homes. The major lead him to the newly build schoolhouse. At least this looked a bit more comfortable.\n\nThe next morning, the major invited him to an official announcement that the school would open. Many dogs looked at him confused or scared. He could imagine that they had never seen a griffon before. The ceremony was in Dogish. Victor could follow along, as he was one of the few people from the south of Bronzehill who had learned it properly, yet the strong accent proved difficult even for him. After the major's speech, he passed the word to the new teacher.\n\nVictor sweated dearly, as he tried to not make mistakes in his Dogish. "Dear dogs of Barazgund. Many of you probably did not expect your new teacher to be a griffon. But make no mistake! I'm from Bronzehill as much as you are, and my family has lived near Hundsfeld for generations. I've come to teach your cubs to read and write and calculate, skills that I believe are worthy to learn for everycreature. My lectures will be in Dogish, but the reading and writing will be in Herzlander. Don't worry, I will try my best to integrate into your way of life. I'm not here to represent Griffenheim or Bronzekreuz, but to give your cubs the best start into their lives.""

 bronzehill_imperialindustrial.1.d:0 "Mara Rosefur slowly walked towards her office, afraid of what she would find today. Since Bronzehill had taken Griffenheim and [BRZ.GetLeader] had been proclaimed Imperial regent, her work had been a total mess. Many griffons around her had either died during the fighting or had been fired by the dogs for having supported the previous regent, leaving her with an impossible workload. She also had gotten a new boss, a diamond dog from Bronzekreuz, but Johanna Whitetail seemed just as overwhelmed as herself.\n\nIn the last weeks, she and her boss had made for a rather comical pair. Johanna seemed to know nothing about how things worked here in Griffenheim, and apparently had only been a minor bureaucrat in the dogs' bureaucracy. Now she was supposed to oversee the department for economic development, quite the serious promotion. In theory, this department would have over a hundred griffs working in it, but Mara was the only one left. The grant requests stacked up to the ceiling, and sooner rather than later the whole office would be taken up by unaddressed paperwork.\n\nDespite these hurdles, she liked her new boss. Her old griffon boss had always been loud and demanding, while Johanna seemed much more understanding and attentive. As she opened the door, she saw her smile across the muzzle. "Hello Mara, finally some good news! Five new griffons were sent to me to work here." Mara noticed the griffons standing behind her boss. "And I've been promised that we will get many more colleagues in the near future. Could you take them for a tour of the office?"\n\nAn hour later, Johanna visited her in her office. "When the new clerks come in, do you want to be my personal assistant? I'm still not entirely up to speed on all the matters here, and we have worked so well together for the last weeks. I could also organize a pay raise for you, for sure." Mara slowly nodded."

She was now the personal assistant to the head of department Johanna Whitetail. Together they oversaw more than hundred officials, and the number was increasing.\n\nAs she came out of the office again, she saw Johanna waving a paw. "Mara, how nice! Our new offices are truly magnificent, aren't they? But things get even better. I've gotten info, from the very top." She was now standing beside Mara, and her voice reduced to a whisper. "Our department is set to grow even larger, you know? There are rumours that we will be tasked with improving the economy on a larger scale."\n\nMara looked into her face. Johanna seemed very excited, her eyes glowing in anticipation. For a moment, Mara was reminded of her old boss, a loud, rude griffon obsessed with power. But at a closer look, Johanna was different. This was not power hunger, this was just joy. \n\n"We will probably get even more people working here. I'm therefore looking for potential head of sections. You are at the top of my list. I think we two make a good team, and you have proven that you have an excellent understanding of administrative matters. How does this sound?""

Last evening she had tasted coffee from Abyssinia for the first time. Unbelievably expensive – but her new salary allowed her such things. After shifting through some more paperwork – luckily she had gotten quite good at grasping things at first glance – she had a meeting with Johanna Whitetail, her boss.\n\n"Mara! Good that you're here. I have some big news for you. We will be responsible for the new economic development plan – the 'Imperial Economic Development Initiative', as it's now officially called. I have already plenty of ideas for that. Isn't this great?"\n\n"Hey, congratulations." Mara paused for a little bit, unsure what to answer. "I guess that we should start to make plans on what to do? I can prepare an overview of economically underdeveloped regions of the Empire, or of goods that are in high demand."\n\n"Yeah, you're always at work. And I appreciate it, too. But for now, I actually want to throw a party with our colleagues. Isn't it great to work for the Empire? Think about all the lives we can make better with our work.""

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius and crown prince Barnaby sat together in the drawing room of Bronzekreuz Castle. It was an underground room in the castle, only dimly lit by the chandaliers on the ceiling.\n\n"Barnaby, my son, as you are probably aware, I have decided to call the Bronzehill council. The crisis that has overtaken Griffenheim has severely impacted us as well. Our nation mournes, as do we, therefore it is neccessary to show unity." Barnaby wagged his tail in approval. "But this is not enough. I have also decided that you, my prince, should get the chairdogship in the council. It is only good if the people see you take responsibility, and I think, you are ready for it."\n\n"I see what you mean. At your will, I will lead the council and look for that the council has only the best interest of Bronzehill in mind. Have you decided yet whom to invite?"\n\nA servant brought in a plate of meatballs. Ignatius and Barnaby ate silently for a while, before Ignatius answered:"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.a:0 ""No. I will need to arrange some meetings.""
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.t:0 "The Old Reformer"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.d:0 "Ignatius decided that he should meet with Winston Copperhill. Though he did not share his son's enthusiasm for the veteran, or Copperhill's distaste for Griffenheim businessgriffs, his career record and accomplishments were not easily disregarded. Thus they sat together at one of the Bronzekreuz clubs, far from anydog's curious ears, sharing a plate of ham and strong Hindian tea between them. "How glad I am you found time for me, Copperhill. How are the pups doing?"\n\n"You haven't invited me here to discuss our children, nor for old war stories, Ignatius. Clearly there is something of greater importance going on, and since I am a busy dog, we should get to it at once." As usual, Winston had little appreciation for decorum, small talk, and wasting time, which the Count could certainly appreciate.\n\n"Very well then. Obviously you heard of it by now — the Emperor has passed away, just as we believed he was about to recover." It still tugged at the heartstrings. "You know what happened last time, you were there and seen it all for yourself. We owe our freedom to griffons, and we'll do anything to keep it that way. To pre-empt any sort of potential instability, I have decided to convene the Bronzehill Council, and you should be present there, though I might not agree if you decide to bring along some friends." Copperhill was hardly a firebrand, but some in his clique were not to Ignatius' sensibilities.\n\nCopperhill kept his expression deliberately impassive, taking a considerable time with the tea. At last, he spoke: "You'll understand if I do not turn out to be your enthusiastic supporter, but I'll gladly accept your invitation. The Emperor's passage has been a... difficult time for everydog, but we cannot mourn forever. This is a great opportunity to enact some positive changes not just for Bronzehill, but for the Empire at wide." Surprisingly optimistic for the old dog, but he wasn't willing to acquiesce just yet. After some further discussion, Copperhill had given the Count some names to consider. Ignatius did not mention that Barnaby would be the chairdog, and since Copperhill had not mentioned it either, chances were good he already knew."

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.t:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.d:0 "Bronzekreuz Castle may not have been the biggest castle, but it surely had its fair share of secrets. Barnaby had spent much of his youth exploring the secret rooms you could find in the underground parts of the castle, and now it came in useful for a quite serious purpose. He had invited a usual guest into the castle, and they both had agreed that their conversation should better remain private. And so, in one of the hidden meeting rooms, Barnaby and Rosey Luxembark sat on old chairs around an even older table.\n\nRosey Luxembark decided to open. "I honestly have to say, this invitation was something I did not expect. And I guess your father would also not expect it?" Barnaby gave a slow nod. "He doesn't exactly have the best opinion on the SPB, I would say." She let out a chuckle.\n\n"He has not, indeed. But this is more important than just his opinion. The workers deserve representation."\n\n"For a price, I assume?"\n\n"To respect the Council would already be quite a good price, I think." Barnaby sighed. "But this is indeed not all. As you can probably imagine, Loudbark will be on the council as well. He and his militarists are a clear danger to our Bronzehill."\n\nLuxembark took a while to answer, weighing her option. "I can help with that, indeed." She let out another chuckle. "I guess it will be quite the shock for the Count when you present him this idea. Anyways, let me give you some names of people you can trust." She fumbled in her briefcase. "Woofkin, yes, Liebarknecht, as well. Not Barking-Sun. Maybe Tählpoodles?" Her words got lost while she was scribbling all over a sheet of paper.\n\nTwo hours later, Barnaby had good knowledge of most upper SPB party members. Luxembark had told some jokes of inside the party, almost forgetting whom she was speaking to. But their plan was clear - now it was on the Crown Prince to convince his father."

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.t:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.d:0 "It was quite unusual for the Count of Bronzehill to visit the barracks in Barkgenz, but Rufus Loudbark had ensured him that there they would find an opportunity to speak in private, for their meetup might be seen as controversial for the more moderate minded dog. Thus the gruff soldier led Ignatius to a nearby bunker, which was positively austere compared to his usual surroundings, but he wasn't going to complain about it. He would have raised a word about his deputy's presence, but Loudbark reassured the Count that Lassie would keep things confidential.\n\nHuddled together in a small room, Loudbark wasted little time with his usual diatribe. "I was most surprised, quite so, when I learned you wished to meet with me, my Count. Have you finally seen the folly of your ways? Have the Griffenheim vultures filched enough marrow from common dogs' bones? Grover is dead, and you know what will happen next. Unrest and insecurity, and poor Bronzehill stuck in the middle of it, with few options for itself." The deputy nodded enthusiastically to everything he said like an excited pup.\n\nIgnatius, however, had to resist the urge to smack himself in the face with both paws. "That's quite enough, Rufus. While your rhetoric might work on somedog more simpleminded, I've been singlepawedly keeping the terms of our agreement with the griffons as fair as they possibly can be." Not to say that they weren't demanding at times. "But you are right about the other thing. There must not be a repeat of 978, and to that end I think the National Union deserves a fair representation in the Bronzehill Council. We might not agree on everything, but especially now everydog must stand together."\n\nHe could almost see the gears turning in Loudbark's head. Accept and gain some actual influence in decision making, or refuse to play the eternal populist complaining from the sides? It didn't take very long. "You can't blame me for trying. We'll be joining you at the Council.""

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.d:0 "The shack looked exactly how he remembered it, poor, dirty and generally in disrepair. How many years had it been? At least four, maybe five. Kimball Barking-Sun looked at his old home, here in the village he was born in. Kaza-Narag was not a special village, just one of many coal mining villages in the upper mountains of Bronzehill. Once a week large trucks arrived to carry away the coal mined, in exchange for food and other necessities. But they were never generous. How was this not slavery? Had they even escaped the mountain tyrant, the slaver of Diamond Mountain, or had they just exchanged his rule for that of his minions?\n\nBut Barking-Sun was not here for nostalgia. No, pressing issues were on the agenda. An opportunity how it could only ever happen once a century had opened. From his spies, he had learned of the meeting between Luxembark and the crown prince, with some juicy information about her opinions on other party members. If Ignatius would dismiss Barnaby's proposal - which he would do, as minion of the mountain tyrant - he would finally find his opening to oust her as chairdog of the SPB and wrangle control of the party for himself. And then, the real task begun. Finally, the old wrong could be corrected, the misfortune of Grover II overcome. And if everything would go according to his plan, the rule of the mountain tyrant could finally be ended for good, four Grovers later than it should have been.\n\nBut for all these lofty plans, he needed the support of the mining dogs. They knew him, and they trusted him. He had worked for years here, besides them, and he knew what steered them. Things would need to start moving, for if this change was missed, how long would it be before another one would present itself?"

They are strong in their belief, standing for faith and Empire."\n\nShe surely would have continued like this for a while, but Lucky cut her off. "Prelate Gunhild, I admire how you always find the right words. But we should come to the matter of this meeting." Always straight to the point. "The socialists have proven more and more emboldend. The Count is double-minded here, sometimes trying to put them down but at other times he lets them get away with their godless posturing. And the Crown Prince is even worse."\n\n"Ignatius is a good person, but his faith is weak. He doesn't trust the Archonate as much as he should. Have I not told him long ago that these socialists needed to be dealt with properly?" She clapped her beak in disappointment. "Perhaps we need to make our support more known to him."\n\n"You are correct, as you always are. I will ready my knights to secure our dear Bronzehill from the unbelievers.""

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.d:0 "Like a few weeks prior, Ignatius and Barnaby sat in the drawing room of Bronzehill Castle. Before them was a long list, the collection of potential councillors. While the Count reserved himself the right to make the final call, he wanted to see what priorities his son would set, and so they vividly discussed each of the candidates. Most of the nobles on the list were set; they were too indispensable and pass over them would just be a political faux pass. Yet, with the political figures on the list, the choices weren't so clear. Both Copperhill and Loudbark had provided a number of candidates that they claimed to deserve a seat, but some of these names would need to be cut to not give the politicians to much power in the council.\n\nAs they argued, Barnaby also had a different thought in mind. It seemed almost inevitable that both the HKP and the NU would end up with the same number of councillors, just to save political face. And here he would need to argue to his father, as he knew that Ignatius was also weary of Loudbark.\n\n"I want to bring a different idea on the table. I know that we are both concerned that Loudbark could sway the council into making decisions that... would be unpleasant to work with. But what if we brought in another candidate? Like Luxembark?" The Count's ears pinned back upon hearing that name, but he didn't say anything. "Including her and maybe one or two of her friends would make controlling Loudbark easier. And it would also serve as a much needed guesture to the working dogs of Bronzehill, that we have not forgotten they exist."\n\nBarnaby tried his best to tempt Ignatius to consider the idea, but his father just fixated him with his eyes. After a while, Barnaby ran out of ideas of what to tell, and so they remained silent for a minute. He knew that the answer would be the final one."

Rosey Luxembark could already tell that somehow her meeting with the Crown Prince had become public - the question just remained how bad it would be. She had already regretted having spilled the beans to much in front of Barnaby. The constant party discussion had just gone on her nerves recently.\n\n"It has come to my knowledge that our chairdog, Comrade Luxembark, has had a meeting with Crown Prince Barnaby.", Barking-Sun opened. "During this meeting, she apparently felt confident to tell the young prince a variety of things. My informant has given me a list of remarks that she made with regards to our much valued comrades." He led out a smirk. "But this is not all. Furthermore, I was informed that Prince Barnaby had offered her a place in the Bronzehill Council, for the price that she would order us to stop distributing 'inflammatory material'. I would like to ask you all, is that the behaviour of a good chairdog? Is that what loyalty to our movement looks like?"\n\nThe meeting went on for a bit. Luxembark tried to defend her meeting with Barnaby as best as she could, while dismissing the "remarks" that Barking-Sun had found out about as baseless slander. However, in the end, she saw no other chance then to call a leadership vote, otherwise the party would never unite behind her anymore. As could be expected, her rival decided to challenge her in that vote.\n\nAnd with a margin of 7-5 votes, the party leadership board voted in favour of Barking-Sun.

"Before you answer anything, I will tell you that I still not approve of the motion. It will be overruled by decree of the Count. The Council will of course complain. But there is no other way now."\n\nWhile the Crown Prince looked miserable, he still tried to give an answer. "My father, I respect your decision. You are the Count. But I want to say at least that the forces I ostensibly unleashed were already there. Many of our institutions are weary of how our relationship with Griffenheim works. And who tells us that it will not end in another catastrophe?"\n\n"I can tell you, it will not. The Griffenheim court is different from how it was 50 years ago. They will figure something out. Our place is to serve the emperor, not trying to overthrow is regent in a useless endeavour."\n\nThe next day, Count Ignatius gave a statement to the Bronzehill Council.

 bronzehill_council.3.d:0 "Kimball Barking-Sun finally made his move.\n\nThe Bronzehill Council had been in deadlock for month at this point, but others have not been as slacking. Early in the morning, a well-organized attack on Bronzekreuz cut the city from the communication lines. Simultaneously, subversive elements in the army derailed an early response plan, while all across the country the mining dogs formed militias to patrol the streets.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the Bronzetail family was tipped off and had decided to spend the days in the summer residence near Bellen. While their estate was quickly assaulted and taken, the Count and his family had already fled into the woods.\n\nAt ten o'clock, a radio message from Barking-Sun could be heard on all channels. "Dogs of Bronzehill! I am speaking to you from Bronzekreuz to tell you that our comrades from the SPB have taken over the government. While the reaction will try to dislodge this act of revolution, we will stand our ground and fight. And then, we will march on Griffenheim to free Grover from those who wish to harm him, so he may lead us to freedom like Grover II once did.""

Of course, quite a few councillors were invited from such an influential institution. Some of them had party loyalties to follow, but a surprising number of these councillors were not aligned to a party, or if they were, interpreted their party membership quite liberal. As such, a natural question arose: Who would get the support from most of them?"

In response to the pressure from the left, the National Union has started to organize counter-protests, and as can be expected, the two groups eventually clashed. The Bronzehill police have all paws full trying to contain the escalating violence, but the situation eventually has now come before the Bronzehill Council. How will the councillors react?"

 bronzehill_council.6.d:0 "When the vote over the "Bronzehill Regency" was announced, most nobles argued against it. It was quite clear that any upheaval to the Bronzehill political landscape could only come at their expense, and so the nobles were naturally closer to Ignatius position. However, the vote passed, and slowly but surely most nobles have realized that the future of Bronzehill would lie in the paws of the parties, not the Bronzekreuz court. With fears about socialism on the rise, both Copperhill and Loudbark have positioned themselves to offer an alternative."

Yet, the few students that do exist in Bronzehill are relatively well connected, and many other young dogs will follow them whenever they would organize protest actions. Like many youth movements, these actions have a left-leaning political tone, supporting the SPB, however not entirely.  As most of the students come from well-off families, a number of them also tend to support the more mild approach of reform from the HKP. Naturally, Rosey Luxembark and Winston Copperhill are trying their best on court these potential supporters."

 bronzehill_loyalist.1.t:0 "A Trip to Readewetter"
 bronzehill_loyalist.1.d:0 "Sitting in his chair in Bronzekreuz castle, Ignatius tried to recapitulate the last few days. All in all, his visit of Gabriela had been quite successful. Upon arriving in Readewetter, was honoured by the Strawberry guards and welcomed by the Countess herself. At the first evening, Gabriela had organized a small ball in his honour. Under the dulcet sounds of the Strawberrian court orchestra, he danced with various noble ladies from the duchy.\n\nThinking about the ball brought his mind to Barnaby. Despite his insistence, his son had excused himself from accompanying him on this trip. How much more would have Barnaby needed this ball! He was 23 now and still unmarried. At this age Ignatius had already had two pups... would he even see his grandpups?\n\nCutting off this rather unpleasant train of thought, he focused again on his trip to Strawberry. The next day, Gabriela and he had the conversation that he had wanted to have. Bronzehill would support her in her effort to wrangle the regency from Eros, and in the meantime the two countries would work closely together to make the most of their combined efforts. Over the next days, he had already made some contacts with Strawberrian investors, who had shown quite the interest of taking over shares of Griffenheim companies.\n\nHis thoughts began to wander again. He liked Gabriela, he really did. She had the right ideas. Eros was so... populist and extreme at times, always coated in religious phrasing. Nonsense. All nonsense. Gabriela would do a much better job, surely."

The dogs of Bronzehill would support her in her endeavour to fight Eros for the regency, and all they demanded in return was some industrial cooperation now and that she would strengthen the position of the nobility in the empire. It was quite nice to hear that Ignatius agreed with her on Eros – the old griff might have outmanoeuvred her in Griffenheim, but she would let not stand."

While this was announced only as an event for industrial cooperation and a "meeting between friends", our spies confirmed that they both have indeed agreed upon a military pact: Should Gabriela attack us, the dogs would join her.

 bronzehill_loyalist.7.t:0 "Boreas' Will"
 bronzehill_loyalist.7.d:0 "Ignatius was wandering around in Griffenheim. The city had been devastated by the war, but the fighting had stopped before the soldiers had reached the Imperial Palace or the Temple of Boreas. And the last one was his goal right now.\n\nHe had never been an overly religious dog. The Trinity was watching over griffons and dogs alike, but their supposed servants would rather meddle in politics instead of providing for their parishioners. Archon Eros had laid claim to the regency and tried to turn the whole empire into being subservient to the temples. But he was gone now...\n\nAnd other questions had arisen instead. It had been Bronzehill's army, his loyal dogs, who had taken the centre of the empire. It was now him who could wander through the city, while his soldiers patrolled the streets. This had truly been an unexpected turn of events – who would have thought that small, poor Bronzehill would have been the one to break through the final defence of the Reichsarmee?\n\nThere must have been some reason for that, Ignatius thought. Arcturius had guided the dogs through their battles, and he had favoured them over the griffons. But Boreas, the highest of the trinity, must have told Arcturius to lead the dogs the way. Here, in his temple, now devoid its priest, he would come to an answer.\n\nThis was his question now. Had Boreas told him that the dogs, that he would be the better regent? Or had he just gave the dogs the strength to save the emperor, as the griffons would have failed? He would need to decide, and decide soon."

And for a moment, all the previous agreements seemed to be in question again. Ignatius has taken his sweet time without messaging us, but now it seems he has decided to honour our pact. The dogs have transferred all territory outside Bronzehill to us and formally declared their loyalty."
 bronzehill_loyalist.8.a:0 "The dogs will get medals galore."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.9.t:0 "Bronzehill's Betrayal"
 bronzehill_loyalist.9.d:0 "The Archon was defeated. What should have been our triumph became our embarrassment has the dogs have taken Griffenheim before us. According to the agreements between Gabriela and Ignatius, the dogs should now transfer Griffenheim to us, together with the regency. But it seems that Bronzehill has now taken a different turn... quite a different turn indeed. Count Ignatius has decided to claim the regency for himself, and now demands our subjugation!

 bronzehill_loyalist.11.d:0 "In a letter to Count Ignatius, Gabriela Eagleclaw has accepted his request for submission.

 bronzehill_loyalist.11.a:0 "She will be welcome here."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.12.t:0 "Another Meeting"
 bronzehill_loyalist.12.d:0 "How things could change, thought Gabriela. Who could have seen this coming? That Ignatius of all people would betray her? He was still a good conversationalist, but she could not help but feel uncomfortable in his presence. Who would have known that he could be so assertive?\n\nYesterday, she had taken the train from Readewetter to Griffenheim. She had to admit, Ignatius had welcomed her warmly, but she was unsure if this made things better or worse. But then, then... she could visit Grover. Her sweet, sweet nephew, how dearly she had missed him. He was so smart. And he had grown quite a bit since she had seen him last.\n\n'Hello Auntie', Grover had said, 'how nice that you are also here. Ignatius has said that he will be my regent, but that you will advise him and me. That's good, right? I like him, but he is very formal.'\n\nShe sighed. It was right that she had submitted to Ignatius. She wouldn't lead the empire, true, but in the end, Grover was all that mattered, right?"
 bronzehill_loyalist.12.a:0 "Ignatius might do a good job after all."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.13.t:0 "Visiting Gunhild"
 bronzehill_loyalist.13.d:0 ""How nice that you have found the way to me, my Lord. I offer you Boreas' blessing, for that your rule may strengthen the faithful and shatter the godless. My acolyte will serve the dinner soon. Do you wish to join me in prayer to Boreas, who sanctions our rule? I invite you to honour the Trinity, for that the Gods find pleasure in our work."\n\nCould she never let go of her unctuous drivel, Ignatius thought. It was already beginning to annoy him again. But he kept up the play and answered in a measured tone: "Prelate Gunhild, I am also most glad to meet you again. I cannot visit your temple as often as I wish," – what a blatant lie, he thought – "but in times like these I am all the more pleased when I can find the opportunity. For the good of Bronzehill, we need to stand together and overcome what divides us."\n\nA little while later, Gunhild and he were sitting at a lavishly laid table. He had to admit, she was not frugal, maybe she even wished to impress him. During the meal, they only made light conversation, but as they got to the dessert, he decided it was time to come to the topic of this meeting.\n\n"As you know, the socialists are spreading lies and unrest to wherever they go. It should be our common goal to stop their efforts, so that the governance of the country is not disturbed. Therefore, I would like to ask you if you would be willing to join me in a common campaign to counter their agitation."\n\n"My Count, it was a folly to not accept Eros as regent. The temples are the strongest defender against the godless. But this decision has been made, and now we have to do what we must. For that, I will join your efforts, for evil must be fought wherever it arises.""
 bronzehill_loyalist.13.a:0 "I hope that's sorted now."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.14.t:0 "Finding An Understanding"
 bronzehill_loyalist.14.d:0 "The griffon on the other side of Ignatius' desk looked very much not happy. "These... policies, if enacted, could seriously hurt Bronzehill's economy." Their bottom line. "I understand that the political situation is difficult, but surely it would be better for everycreature if the economy would not experience the same troubles, right? In the name of the Bronzehügeler Industrieverein, I would like to express my deepest concerns."\n\n"It is understandable that some investors might be concerned about the impact of the proposed measures." Ignatius answered. "Yet, I'm afraid, there is no other way. It is more than likely that Bronzehill will need to stand against Griffenheim, even if hopefully not for long. Under these circumstances the current arrangements are simply no longer viable."\n\n"But why should we be so hasty here? Nogriff wants to interfere in the matter of higher politics." They only did this all the time, Ignatius thought. "We from the Industrieverein simply want everydog and everygriff to prosper. I think that we should look over our agreements again." The pain her face was clearly visible. This would cost them many idols either way. "For sure we can figure something out, together."\n\nAfter three hours of intense haggling, the outlines of a new industrial plan for the country took form. It had not been easy, but Bronzehill's economy would be much more independent in the future."

 bronzehill_loyalist.15.t:0 "A Thought Close To Heart"
 bronzehill_loyalist.15.d:0 "Tradition.\n\nHow many dogs would feel the same as him upon hearing that word? Probably not too many, Ignatius had to admit. But wasn't it a wonderful thing? Everything in life had a tradition. From humble things like clothing and food, all the way up to the big questions of governance. It gave security, it gave confidence, it gave stability.\n\nBronzehill had gone through trying times, truly, but now things were starting to come back together. The alliance with Strawberry stood strong, the internal forces that tried to tear Bronzehill apart had been contained and the public mood had swung back to his side. How did he do this? By looking at what truly mattered: Tradition.\n\nIgnatius smiled. It was time to prepare for war, but nothing in life could be as worth fighting for as the tradition of the Empire."

 bronzehill_loyalist.16.t:0 "An Envoy From Bronzekreuz"
 bronzehill_loyalist.16.d:0 "Today, an envoy arrived from Bronzekreuz. She brought good news, but also a petition for help.\n\nAfter the death of Grover V, Bronzehill went through a political crisis. Many dogs wanted for Bronzehill to become more autonomous – and they even went so far as to suggest that our government should be overthrown in favour of their own regency. However, being the voice of reason, Count Ignatius has overruled these plans, and with this envoy renews his pledge of loyalty towards the Emperor and our regency.\n\nBut this pledge also comes with a request for help. The political forces that have given the Count so much trouble have not given up yet, and he hopes for our support to suppress the troublemakers. We would be foolish not to send him what little he needs, so we have already send the envoy back, so that she can deliver some funds to our loyal dogs."

 bronzehill_loyalist.17.t:0 "A Parade For Unity"
 bronzehill_loyalist.17.d:0 "The parade came down the street, covered in Imperial flags. The music could be heard from a mile away, as the army orchestra of the Kaisergarde played one triumph march after the other. Griffenheim had sponsored airplanes for the parade, their loud noise being the only thing to overpower the music whenever they dashed over the city, leaving trails in yellow, orange and black.\n\nWoofrey Pawner stood behind the guard rails. The dogs around him where ecstatically waving the troops as they marched. He had to admit, it was hard to not get drawn into the enthusiasm, and so he also waved with the little Imperial flag that police had distributed before the event. Masses were a strange thing, really.\n\nA few hours later, he sat at the table in his house, together with his wife Barkah. She had decided that she didn't want to see the parade, but that didn't mean she wouldn't be curious. "Tell me, how was it? Had they really these flying metal boxes? They didn't crash down, or? I don't trust these things. Griffons can do a lot with their enchantments, but why don't they use their wings, as Eyr intended?" She shook her head.\n\nWoofrey scratched his ear with his hind paw. "Well, yes, they had airplanes. And they seemed to fly very stable. I don't think they rely on magic, though. But they left trails of colour, it was pretty amazing, I have to admit. But they were also loud, very loud. Eh... otherwise, they had music. The orchestra from the Kaisergarde. It was pretty good. Too many marching songs for my taste. But... eh... perhaps fitting for the parade?"\n\n"I still don't know what to make of this. I mean, yes, we should all support the emperor. But don't you think that our Count has become a bit strict lately? I hope that this all cools down again. We dogs serve the emperor, but these businessgriffs, I tell you... I don't like them.""

 bronzehill_loyalist.18.d:0 "It was a quiet day, as if made for this sombre occasion. The opening ceremony for the Grover V Memorial Park was not bombastic, like other celebrations these days, but it was made to honour a late Emperor, and this meant respect and thoughtfulness. Even after this long time, the dogs still mourned.\n\nCount Ignatius opened the ceremony. "Dogs of Bronzehill! This park here is to remind us of a great Emperor, Grover V. His son Grover VI, long may he life, now sits on the golden throne in Griffenheim, where [GRI.GetLeader] acts as his faithful regent. But on this day, we remember the Emperor that has passed on, embraced by Boreas' benign wings. Let us now pray, as Prelate Gunhild prepares the offerings to the Gods, that they may look favourably upon our deeds."\n\nAt his command, the griffoness prepared the offerings. As a number of juicy steaks burned to give to the gods, she spoke the sermon: "Boreas, highest of the gods, hallowed be your name! You gave us intellect, for that we may make wonders for your honour. Eyr, god of the family, hallowed be your name! You gave us bodies, for that we may work in your praise. Arcturius, god of war, hallowed be your name! You gave us strength, for that we may fight for your glory! Gods of the Trinity, look on our work, and give your divine blessing to our monument. This park will hereby be devoted to Grover V, blessed be his name, so we may remember him forever in our heart. Pray, dogs and griffons, who wander through here, for that your hearts may remain pure and loyal, ready to serve the Griffonstone dynasty, now and forever. For that is the will of the gods."\n\nAfter the offerings, the Count gave another speech before the park was finally opened officially. The dogs and griffons spread through the green to look at the various statues of Grover V that adorned the park."

 bronzehill_autonomist.1.d:0 "The news from Bronzehill were troublesome in recent times. After the coup by Kimball Barking-Sun, the former county had taken a radical turn, and the new ruler seemed to purge any institution of the old state.\n\nThe former Count had been forced to flee his residence during the revolution, but so far he had stayed in Bronzehill, in the hopes that loyal elements of the army or bureaucracy would allow for his restauration, or that the Empire would intervene on his behalf. However, now it seems that the Barking-Sun had started a targeted search to dispel the last remnants of monarchist resistance, and if Ignatius didn't want to be captured, he finally had to abandon his old home. His son, Prince Barnaby, had retreated deeper into the mountains together with some loyal followers, but it seemed unlikely that they could risk an open rebellion any time soon.\n\n[THIS.GetLeader] welcomed Ignatius warmly. "My friend, I am sorry for you. While Bronzehill might be ruled by godless revolutionaries for now, there can be little doubt that the Empire shall return one day. I promise you that once this day comes, you will be reinstated in your old titles."\n\n"I am most thankful for your kind words. However, the dogs that I sought to guide and protect have failed me, and I have no aspirations to return to Bronzekreuz. I believe that the lands are better to be ruled by the Emperor directly. For my part, I have no higher wish than to serve the him. Might the other dogs have gone crazy, I know my duty, and I will fulfil it to the best of my ability.""

"Either we strike now or never."\n\nAnother knight took his sword and rammed it into the ground. "This is all so stupid. We are probably sitting in the same cave that they sat before us, and now we prove to be even more coward then they have been. If we do it now, they army might still join us. We have waited too long already."\n\nSurrounded by the knights sat a single, old griffoness. Most would have not associated her with the noble priest that preached the sermon in Ravensburg. Prelate Gunhild had lost some of her feathers, together with most of her eloquent style. "The socialists are the spawn of Maar. We need to squash their heads in for their crimes against the Gods! Trying to arrest me – me, that I'm the representative of Boreas himself. These godless sinners need to go – all of them. If my old friend here" – she looked over to the Grandmaster – "had not warned me in time, only the Gods know what these creatures would have done to me."\n\nFinally, Grandmaster Lucky moved. "You are all maddogs. An attack right now would be suicide. Their government will fail as soon as Griffenheim moves; then we can come out of our caves to serve..."

Seeing the many loyal dogs, ready to serve the Emperor just like he was, filled him with proud. The dogs still had their spirit – together, they would free Grover, who would lead them to true liberty. Inspired by the moment, Barking-Sun stopped. His entourage looked to him in confusion, but he just barked that they should get him a microphone.\n\n"My loyal dogs! The hour approaches. Not for long, and our loyalty will be tested on the battlefield. The reactionaries will throw their griffons against our lines, hoping to stop our advance so that they may keep the Emperor chained forever. But I believe in you. I have heard great things about your training, and I can see on your faces that you are ready to march against the enemy. But don't become complacent! The fight will be hard, long and bloody."\n\nBarking-Sun stopped for a moment, collecting himself. "And now I ask you: Are you ready to fight?" A loud 'Yes' echoed form the soldiers.

I can understand why you would find the new government to be unusual for Bronzehill, but these changes where necessary. We are not here to pursue a radical change of course."

 # Ignatius regency
 
 bronzehill_ignatius.1.t:0 "A Curious Inquiry"
 bronzehill_ignatius.1.d:0 "Wagon after wagon of food and drinks arrived at the palace. The number of servants seemingly had increased even more, and all across the palace the rooms looked cleaner than ever. As Grover wandered around his palace, he could see some griffons furiously scrubbing a tapestry depicting Grover II's crusade. As long as he could remember, it had always looked rather dire – possibly due to its location in some far flung wing of the extensive palace – but now the colours were vibrant again as if it was freshly knotted.\n\nThe general business had caught onto him, and he decided to inquire from his regent what this was all about. He found Ignatius in the great hall, where he was busy debating with some strange looking merchants. From what he understood, they debated with Ignatius in Aquileian – Grover had started to learn this language already, but he wasn't good enough yet to follow the conversation. He decided to make himself known by slapping Ignatius' hind paw with his wings.\n\nIgnatius almost made a roll backwards as he noticed his Emperor. "Grover, my Emperor! What brings me the honour of your presence?" Seemingly confused, he looked around. "And may I ask where your nanny… where Johanna is?"\n\nGrover rolled his eyes. "I've left her in my room. But now tell me, what's going on here? Why do the servants clean tapestry in wings nogriff will ever wander? And what is all the food for?"\n\n"Ah yes. I would have told you in due time, but I can also tell you now. There's going to be a grand ball here in Griffenheim, with nobles and other seigneuries invited from all over your Empire. Great, isn't it? We still have to prepare quite a few things – including you getting a new ball dress to show off.""

 bronzehill_ignatius.2.d:0 "Ignatius could not deny being slightly nervous. Various guests had already arrived, those that had the highest ranks and would stay in Griffenheim palace for the event. He had memorized a lot of names, and so far his mind had not betrayed him. But the ball in total would have over 2000 noble families invited – while he would maybe not shakes paws with all of them, here he would need to rely on the help of the palace servants.\n\nBut the first day, and even more so the first evening, had been reserved for the truly high nobility. Ignatius had commissioned a dance suite that would be performed by the palace orchestra. Grover had shown off his new dress – excessively fashionable and expensive, as would be expected from an Emperor. The palace kitchen had presented various delicacies, and Ignatius had seen with a smile that Grover seemed to enjoy the variety in food. Hopefully he didn't demand to get those every day now, as this would be capable of draining an unhealthy amount of state funds.\n\nGrover. Right. Yesterday, the young boy had made a very favourable impression. But it also had gotten quite late, and it showed today. Ignatius had allowed this, because after all, the highest nobility was the most important one, and also Grover seemed to genuinely have fun. But today he would need to be more careful. The ball would go on for three more days, and the Emperor would need to be at least somewhat awake for the closing ceremony.\n\nSnapping out of this short moment of recollection, Ignatius moved to welcome more guests. Maybe Grover wasn't the only one who should get more sleep."

 bronzehill_ignatius.3.d:0 "Ignatius sat in his office in Griffenheim palace, pondering the events of the last week. The ball that he held had certainly improved his position among his fellow nobles. It now seemed that they would accept and indeed support him as Imperial regent. He smiled. The Empire would enjoy the stability of noble rule. And eventually, Grover would grow up and Ignatius would retire, but the Empire would continue onwards, with the nobles as a bastion of stability.\n\nBut was it all so easy? Some eerie thoughts creeped into Ignatius head. He started to think about the revolution of 978, and all the misfortune that had led to it. Even though he hated the thought, it seemed undeniable that the noble regency council for poor Grover V had played a part in the events. These nobles had not had the best interested of their subjects at heart.  What a disgrace! Even remembering it was painful for him.\n\nA sudden realization sent a shiver across Ignatius' body. Was he about to make the same mistake? Giving out the power to nobles, and they would just indulge in excesses? Even the possibility of him being the cause of another revolution made him whimper. Never! No, this could not stand.\n\nFor some reason, he always had assumed that all nobles would be like the ones he knew from Bronzehill, modest, temperate and loyal to the Emperor. But as he recalled the ball and examined the nobles' behaviour under this aspect, he realized an uncomfortable truth: For the Empire as a whole, he would need to take precautions..."

He sighed. Any further denial was simply ignorant. His fellow nobles were unable to restrain themselves, to carry out the task that the Gods had given them with dignity and wisdom. Instead, there was greed everywhere, as well as arrogance and cruelty. \n\nHis paw began to shake. Had he not tried everything? Had he not been a good enough example? How many efforts had he undertaken, trying to get the nobility of the Empire to act like one! This is how they repaid him for his efforts to rebuild the rightful order? What a show of disgrace. What... what could he have done differently? What should he have done to prevent this?\n\nHe let out a whimper, and took not long until wept bitterly. Luckily, no servant could hear him in this moment of weakness. His whole project in life, to prove that the nobility could and would rule for the good of everycreature – it had failed miserably, and now he had to deal with the consequences.\n\nAfter a while, his grief had been replaced by a grim determination. Fine! The nobles don't want to rule for good? Then they should not rule at all! From now on, he would centralize power around Griffenheim and the Emperor. The court was something he could oversee personally, and then he would need to write laws to stop the excesses elsewhere. It would not be an easy task, but it could be done, and, by Boreas, it would be done!"

 bronzehill_ignatius.6.d:0 "Ignatius sat in a restaurant in Skyfall, in a cosy backroom that only the barkeeper knew of. On the other side of the table sat a griffon, which was visibly less comfortable than Ignatius. He was the manager of the one of Skyfall's largest banks. Not the owner – by royal decree all business owners who had supported the "false republic" had been expropriated. Their former staff, such like this griffon, now had to wait for orders from the Imperial government on what would be done with the assets.\n\nFor some, the Imperial government would come in the form of the regent himself. After having exchanged a few pleasantries, Ignatius decided to cut straight to the business. "Would you have an estimate of the liquid assets of the bank for me? I guess I should have consulted the books before I met you, but I couldn't find the time." Ignatius showed a smile. Of course he had consulted the books. "Just so that we know what we are dealing with here."\n\n"I have some overview, yes. Of course, the exact numbers are hard to all remember, right?" The griffon tried give a smile, but failed. "But the vault should contain roughly 6 million idols, and papers of a value of maybe 6 million more. Although their value is hard to know for sure at this moment. Furthermore, the bank holds artwork and alike for around 2 million idols."\n\nIgnatius nodded. The griffon was honest, or at least knew that any tomfoolery at this moment would be suicidal. "A healthy liquidity for sure. Skyfall's traders always knew how to make a profit. A shame that they decided to not share it with the Emperor. But this is of no importance anymore. Their riches will be used for the good of Empire. You can now prepare the transfer of all assets into the Imperial treasury."

My travels were most pleasant, and my estates had bountiful harvests. The Empire is prospering under your guidance. It seems to me, that your regency of the Empire is truly blessed by the Gods. May I congratulate you on your latest successes?"\n\nIgnatius showed a slight smile. The exchange of pleasantries went on for a while, as was usual for conversations between nobles, particularly during official invites. Eventually, a servant served a light snack, and the conversation could come to the heart of the matter.\n\n"Now, my lady, may I ask if you have considered my proposition? Your record of service to the Empire is surely impressive, and I would be most grateful if the Empire could rely on your support again." Lady Diana tilted her head. "As I said in my letter, I can offer you to oversee the department of agriculture in the Imperial administration. The task in this is twofold: To organize the food supply across the Empire, but also to make sure that the landed estates, the true pillar of the Imperial rule, are heard in their needs. And I cannot imagine somegriff better suited for this position that you are."\n\n"Your words hold truth, Regent Ignatius. In the last thirty years that I’ve managed my estates, I have learned a thing or two about agriculture, and also have made contact with many of my peers. When I got your offer, I was therefore already decided to accept it. I will gladly serve the Empire once more.""

 bronzehill_ignatius.8.t:0 "A New Archon"
 bronzehill_ignatius.8.d:0 "Ignatius sat before his desk and shuffled through some conversations. The abrupt end to Eros’ regency had left the Archonate of Boreas without an Archon. So far, he had just stalled any efforts to elect a new one… but no more. In the last weeks, he instead had invited several high-ranking clergy members into the palace, and visited more around Herzland. And now he felt ready that the new election could come.\n\nTraditionally, the elections of a new Archon were a highly secretive affair. Only the highest members of the Archonate were invited, and then choose one of their own as new representative of their god. This gave the Archonates a considerable amount of independence – they were not beholden to the Emperor or the Empire. The Temples they oversaw formed a parallel structure to the Imperial government, with the tithes they collected being their own to manage as they pleased.\n\nBut now there was an opening. The Archonate of Boreas was the highest among them, and its top position being vacant left the entire temple structure in a limbo state, which had weakened them already. The new Archon would be elected shortly, and officially the ceremony was as secret as always. But Ignatius had made sure that all of the griffons involved knew the position of the Emperor. And also that the continued cooperation with the government would be positively affected if his majesty’s preferred candidate would be chosen.\n\nA few hours later, a courier arrived from the Grand Temple of Boreas. The new Archon was chosen, and it was Ignatius’ favourite. She had taken the name of Agatha II. And this now opened even more possibilities. In the future, cooperation between Emperor and temples would be much smoother. And much more one-sided."

 bronzehill_ignatius.9.t:0 "A Chance Missed"
 bronzehill_ignatius.9.d:0 "Ignatius shook his head. This wasn’t working. All the time and effort and preparation he had poured into this project, only for the temples to barely move. Agatha II seemed much more comfortable with the status quo than he had hoped for. His reform propositions got blocked by the established priests, and even though he had moved Agatha into her new position just a few month ago, she was refusing to grant priesthood to his preferred appointees.\n\nHe snorted with anger. Fine then! Maybe he should have done more. But he had an Empire to run on the side, and not all of his efforts could go into just one project, regardless of how important it was. But this was still… He sighed. How could his efforts gone so wrong?\n\nBut now there was only one thing left to do, namely to call this whole operation off. The relations with the temples had been strained by his constant reform efforts, and any more interference could cause the anger to boil over. In the end, here Ignatius had to accept the loss and move on, for the better of the Empire overall."

 bronzehill_ignatius.10.t:0 "Token Reforms"
 bronzehill_ignatius.10.d:0 "The reports piled up on Ignatius’ desk. Protocols from many committee meetings, letters from and to all sorts of priests and files about temple conduct in various cases. If somedog was to look at all of this from the outside, surely they would think that sweeping reforms were enacted. The reality was much more mundane.\n\nThe Imperial regent had of course read all of these papers. He had made comments on some of them, with rather unstatesmanlike highlights such as “fire this idiot” and “Maar damn these temples”. Yet, the result was still meagre. The established structures in the end had proven to be a rather heavy obstacle.\n\nBut on the other paw, it had not entirely been for naught. After heavy pressure, the Emperor could now veto appointments to prelates to the various regions to the Empire. Also, the temples had to give the Imperial administration access to their records, which would make any future efforts of the priesthood to bribe public officials much harder.\n\nIgnatius rang a bell in his office and a servant appeared promptly. “Take these reports to the archive. I… I no longer need them.” The servant nodded and left with claws full of paper, despite not even carrying half the documents. He shook his head. Was it right to give up now? He knew the answer was yes, but it was hard to come to terms with it. The mood among the priests was deteriorating, and further reform efforts could bring about the collapse of everything achieved so far. But he had had so many plans – now they would be all buried. Maybe Grover could do another round of reform, once he had come of age."

His time and effort had not been wasted – in the future the Emperor would have a much greater say in the affairs of the Archonates. Sure, there were those who resisted his efforts, and some of the more ambitious reforms were ultimately shot down, but this was to be expected.\n\nBut why stop here? Ignatius could feel the temptation to just keep pushing, but his carefulness prevailed. Yes, most reports were positive, but the temples showed clear signs of exhaustion from reforms. If he was to keep going, the mood could flip, and all the things he achieved so far would be in question once more.\n\nRegardless, the list of reforms was impressive. The Emperor would now be officially consulted before the election of a new Archon, and while this consultation technically wasn’t binding, the temples knew they depended on good cooperation. The tithes that the people owed the temples were now collected by the Imperial bureaucracy. Officially this was a privilege the Emperor bestowed on the temples, but in reality it would soon make the temples completely reliant on the secular structures of government. And the last and greatest reforms, the temple courts responsible to punish crimes against religious law were abolished and these cases integrated into the secular court structure.\n\nWith a smile on his face, the Imperial regent pulled his seal and pressed it onto the decree before him. The hard work of months would finally come to a good end."

 bronzehill_ignatius.12.t:0 "The Great Temple Reform"
 bronzehill_ignatius.12.d:0 "Ignatius could not stop to grin as the read through the reports. One after another, the temples had budged and made way to sweeping reform. The independent Archonates of the past were done for, from now on the Emperor would hold all the strings in his claws. Not even he himself had truly believed that the temples would accept all of his reforms, but with just the right incentives – and threats – he had accomplished a masterpiece.\n\nAnd of course, the new Archon Agatha II had been a useful asset. Not because she was overly eager to reform, no, but because she was gullible and weak, like wax in Ignatius’ firm paws. Great effort and time had been poured into these reforms. He had worked day and night for the last months, with countless letters and visits to various clergy. But could there have been a greater reward then what was before him?\n\nThe most important reform was that from now on, the Emperor would appoint the Archons. While they technically still needed confirmation from a collegium of clergygriffs, this would be just a formality. Further, the temples would no longer collect a tithe, but instead they would receive idols from the Imperial treasury. The former tithes would be integrated into the Imperial tax codes, to be paid fairly by all those who owed to the gods. With their monetary independence lost, the temples could no longer hope to be able to corrupt officials of the Empire. As a third reform, the Emperor would directly appoint all prelates for the various regions of the Empire, including the right to recall them at any point, for any reason. And finally, the temple courts for religious crimes would be totally abolished, all religious laws be integrated into the Imperial code, to be overseen by the Emperor, with the secular courts taking on all those cases in the future.\n\nAs Ignatius pressed his seal into the decree before him, he could not stop to wag his tail in excitement. The Emperor would get a stable Empire, only beholden to him."

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.1.t:0 "A Different Lecture"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.1.d:0 "The wind caressed Grover's beak as he looked out of the car. A week ago, his regent had visited him after his lectures, and offered Grover "a different kind of lecture". 'Your lectures in literature, languages, math, history and the natural sciences are all important for a good ruler. But this, I believe, can be a lecture in rulership itself.'\n\nDuring the last week, Ignatius and he had cruised across the country side. They had visited various villages and took part in a variety of events. Ignatius had planned the route carefully, as in almost every larger settlement they visited, there was some event happening. In one town, it had been a 500 year anniversary, the next just had a feast celebrating a local folk hero and in a third case, it had been the birthday of the local noble. Each and every time, Ignatius had told him about the nature of the event before, and asked Grover to prepare something he wanted to say. It would only be a few words, but he would practice with his regent before, and then speak them during the event. Afterwards, Ignatius would hold a much longer speech, but the locals seemed much more interested in Grover.\n\nNow they were on the way home. Grover's reminiscence was interrupted when Ignatius asked him: "Now, my Emperor, this was your first practical lesson in rulership. What do you think was important during this week? What have you learned?"\n\nGrover took a moment before he answered. "It looked to me that they appreciated when I said something to them. So, I think, a good Emperor needs to show his subject that he cares, right? I've heard you talking a lot about how the nobility has an obligation towards the peasants they rule over to provide for them in times of need. The Emperor then has the same obligation towards all of them.""

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.2.t:0 "Emperor, Come Dance With Me"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.2.d:0 "His lectures for the day were out, and so Grover decided to simply walk through the palace. The Imperial palace was enormous in size, and flying from one side to the other could take five minutes if you included the gardens. But Grover was in no mood to fly. His last lesson had been dancing, and his head still spun about the various sequences. And of course it was not easy to balance oneself on the hind paws all the time. As his dancing teacher told him, flapping his wings for easier balancing was considered "unrefined" – and therefore not good enough for an Emperor.\n\nBut this was not the strangest part about these lectures. The dances he practiced were for pairs, and so he needed a partner. In his mind, he could have just chosen someone he liked, but his regent insisted that the Emperor dancing with the same griffoness, even if just for practice, would "send the wrong signals". What a chaos for nothing! If it was for him, he would have just chosen the daughter of some servant if the nobles would seriously lose their feathers about such trivialities. But no, instead he had to dance with a different noble chick from the court for each lesson.\n\nBut maybe it wasn't as boring for them as it was for him. Some of these girls looked quite nervous, even if it was just for some dumb lecture. And all of them were rather over styled for this mundane occasion. The more he thought about it, the more he came to the realization that for his dancing partners, it likely really was a special moment. Sure, for him they were all just some nobles, but for them, he was the Emperor...\n\nGrover clacked his beak, both annoyed and embarrassed by this thought. He had been rude to some of them for no good reason, and thinking back, in these moments they had seemed almost scared. But also, why was his life so Maar-damn complicated? Why couldn't he just practice dancing in peace?"

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.3.t:0 "A Driving Lesson"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.3.d:0 "Grover and Ignatius arrived on the military restricted area near Helheim. After he had beseeched his regent for almost half a year, Ignatius had agreed that he could drive around in a real tank. Grover had been fascinated by these armoured monsters as far back as he could think, and he always wanted to try what it felt like to operate one.\n\nOn the military area, they were welcomed by a very strict – and strong – looking griff. Grover was not sure if he should be scared, but as the soldier looked at him, he showed a wide smile. "Welcome, my Emperor. I'm Thomas Stifftail from the 3rd Imperial tank brigade. Do you want to drive a tank?" Grover nodded. "Then follow me. We got a real beauty over here, fresh from the factory. One of the really heavy ones. I wish we could get those monsters when driving into battle." He led out a quick laughter.\n\nThomas led Grover and Ignatius to a true beast of a tank. Grover flew up to the top and crawled into the tank. Here, three other griffons already waited for him. Thomas followed him shortly after, and then went on to explain Grover how such a tank operated. "So, my Emperor. You get to be the driver, as I think you'll like that. We have a free field before us, a test field were we try out new equipment. Marcus here is the gunner, Julia is the loader and Lisa the radio operator. I'm the commander, as usual. So even though you are the Emperor, you should listen what I say, right?" Thomas gave Grover a wink.\n\nAfter Thomas had explained Grover the pedals and how to look out for where he was driving, they started the tour. It was quite the experience. A lot tighter than Grover had expected, even in such a large tank, and also everything shook and jerked as they rolled over just grassland, which was quite uncomfortable. As climax, Grover was allowed to tell Marcus to fire a shot. He could feel the tank vibrating as the round left the barrel, and shortly afterwards he heard a big boom."

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.4.t:0 "Theory And Practice"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.4.d:0 ""My Emperor, would you allow me to interrupt you for a moment?" Grover, sitting on his desk over some books, looked up. "Tomorrow I and some senior administrators will hold a meeting to discuss the economic development of the Empire. I believe that it could be interesting for you to partake. As I hear, you are making great progress in your studies, but seeing the practical side of things is always a different experience altogether."\n\nGrover quickly agreed, and so the next morning, his usual lectures had to wait. Ignatius picked him up from the Royal Chambers, and together they went to the meeting. As they arrived at the meeting room, his regent introduced the participants to him: "My Emperor, this is Johanna Whitetail from the department of economic development. You have probably heard of her in your studies, as she is responsible for the IEDI plan, right? And here is Diana von Mirabelle from the department of agriculture. She is responsible for managing the food supply across the Empire, a serious task as she has to hold contact with many local nobles." The dog and griffoness bowed before the Emperor, and then the meeting could begin.\n\nWhat followed was completely different from what Grover had expected. He had either assumed some dry, sluggish scrolling throw stacks of paper or some highly ceremonial affair like when holding court, but it was neither of those. While Johanna and Diana both had brought stacks of papers, together with various diagrams, it was more a brainstorming type of meeting. Discuss what worked and worked not economically, find inefficiencies and come up with new ideas. Grover quickly found himself drawn into the discussion, and to his surprise, his ideas were not ignored or dismissed, however also not easily accepted. All the knowledge that he had learned during his studies – how many boring hours had it been – suddenly felt relevant, as he tried to remember everything he learned to make a fruitful contribution."

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.5.t:0 "The Adventures Of Prince Strongclaw"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.5.d:0 "Grover closed the book and let out a sigh. He enjoyed reading, and "The Adventures of Prince Strongclaw" had been one of his favourites during his childhood. Now he had found the time to read it once more, as a throwback to younger, easier times, or so it felt to him. But there were certain aspects that he had not remembered from reading it as a cub. Why did Prince Strongclaw go out to rescue Princess Anita from the dragons? He had always assumed it was only "what knights do", and that the two ended up marrying held little relevance to him as a child.\n\nHe got up from his armchair to lie on his bed. Love - what a strange thing for sure. He could feel that he had changed from just a two or three years back. He noticed the chicks of his court, and he wondered how things would develop. Ignatius had told him, that as the Emperor, he would need to be careful and vigilant at all times. Noble families would fight for his grace, even and especially by matters of love. 'But the duty of an Emperor always comes first', Ignatius had said. 'You might not understand it now, but in our spheres any feelings need to take a backseat to politics.'\n\nBut Ignatius warning was only half the truth, Grover figured. Some noble daughters from the court had tried to approach him, but their advances had been as boring as transpicuous. And when he felt the courage to talk to one of them on his own, they would react scared and submissive. Sure, some acted tough, but he could feel that their overwhelmed self underneath that.\n\nHe let out another sigh. Sometimes, he thought, being just a normal griff would make things easier. This was certainly one of those cases. He would surely end up marrying some griffoness, and with a bit of luck she would be friendly and good-looking. But in moments like this, he doubted that he could ever experience something like Prince Strongclaw. Princess Anita had the standing to give her prince contra, and their love was built on true respect for each other. What future wife could give him that?"

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.6.t:0 "Council For An Emperor"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.6.d:0 "Grover and Ignatius sat in the dining hall of the palace. It was a rare occasion that it was just the two of them, as normally some other nobles would join them for the privilege of dining with the Emperor. But today was an exception, not by happenstance, but because Grover had told Ignatius that he wanted to discuss something. As they sat over a plate of meatballs and cheese, the old dog looked at Grover curiously, waiting for the Emperor to start.\n\n"Ignatius, my regent, the matter I wanted your opinion on was this declaration I found when I toured the city the other day. I asked my servants to bring me a copy, so that I could take a closer look." Grover produced a scroll of paper. "Here. It states, that the Emperor, so I, 'hold council with Boreas'. Now, I try to be a pious griff for sure, but I certainly can't claim as much as is written here."\n\nIgnatius showed a smile. "My Emperor, I understand your reservations. But when we talk to the common griff, some romantic hyperbole is almost expected. As the symbol of griffonhood itself, why shouldn't the populace think that you have a more direct connection to the Gods? For them, it is the same anyways. You rule by the grace of Boreas, the priests praise you name and the knights swear their oath to both the Gods and you."\n\nGrover twisted his beak. "You make it seem like I'm the fourth among them! Romantic hyperbole for sure, but we should know measure and limit. So far, I cannot claim divine inspiration in anything – even though that would make my life quite a bit easier."\n\n"Yes, my Emperor, we all wish that some higher deity would guide us easily. But the world is more mundane than the temples claim, and we have to make our own decisions, for better or worse. And as we do so, we need to keep up the appearance in some matters. In reality, you will rather council with some nobles. What is written here is to justify the actions of the government by giving it divine backing. The message is that defying you, or the Empire, means abandoning the Gods, and this is all your citizens need to know."

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.7.t:0 "Visions Of The Past, Visions Of The Future"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.7.d:0 "It was one of Grover's quite moments that he had for himself. For today, he had decided to visit the Imperial gallery, where paintings showed scenes and griffons from the Empire of his ancestors. He slowly wandered through them. Grover I with the Idol of Boreas, Grover II as mighty warrior, Grover III as respected lawgiver and Grover IV surrounded by other nobles feasting. And then of course, his father, Grover V. Even through the artists indulgent view one could see the sickly stature of the poor griffon.\n\nIn less than a year time, it would be his turn. True, Grover V was denied his crown for longer, but he trusted Ignatius. The old dog would not deny him his birth right. Quite the contrary, Grover suspected his regent to count the days more than he did. And then? What would he do with the crown?\n\nFor a moment, Grover felt sombre, but then a wave on enthusiasm swapped over him. Enough of this nonsense! He was a great griffon, not as sickly as his father, not as fat or anaemic as his grandfather. Ignatius had made a terrific job of preparing the Empire, and now Grover would lead it to prosperity and greatness. Life opened before him, he would have a trusted panel of advisors ready to help him and he already had plenty of ideas for what he wanted to do.\n\nHe continued to wander the gallery, admiring the paintings with scenes of Grover I and II. Art really could inspire, and he felt inspired as never before. Of course, he reminded himself, he should keep Ignatius' teaching in mind – greatness was not a goal in of itself, and an overambitious Emperor could harm the Empire as much as a slacking one. But he would surely find the right balance."

 bronzehill_revenge.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius had struggled to keep it together for weeks now, ever since the news of the Emperor's death had torn his world apart. He sat listlessly behind his desk, shuffling papers back and forth when the messenger came storming in through the door, a telegram in his paw, gasping for breath as if he had ran all the way from Griffenheim.\n\n"Sir... sir..." he panted, holding out the Telegram. "News from Griffenheim... someone... someone...", he couldn't say more, and Ignatius slowly took the letter, staring at the short message. He blinked, unable to understand the words at first. He read it over and over, as if it was written in a different language, but soon the paper fell from his paw. A... a coup? And the crown prince had been...\n\nHe rose onto unsteady paws, stumbling away from his desk. It couldn't be, that letter had to be wrong... it couldn't be! Not that too! Not that too! He screamed, howling in despair as he slammed his paws against the wall, pounding it furiously as he slowly sank down to his knees, whining incoherently. He didn't even comprehend what was going on as two guards came into the room, pulling him away from the wall as he kept slamming his now bleeding paws into it, nor could he understand them when they tried to reach through to him.\n\nIn the end, Count Ignatius was dragged out of his office and brought to the hospital, even as the news spread from the palace to the city, and from the city to the country. Not enough that the emperor was dead, someone had murdered his son as well. The lineage of Grover, their saviour, was gone, it had been snuffed out, and in its place the military had taken control over Griffenheim."

 bronzehill_revenge.2.t:0 "How Much Can A Dog Endure?"
 bronzehill_revenge.2.d:0 "Ignatius had been hospitalised for days after the stress of Grover's fate took its toll on his heart, but his condition had not improved. The end of the Grover lineage had taken his will to live, and on the fifth day after the news from Griffenheim arrived, his heart beat no longer.\n\nBarnaby stood before the deathbed of his father, failing to find words for his feelings. The madgriff in Griffenheim had taken everything from him: not only his emperor and his father, but his ideals as well. What use were empty slogans about Harmony in this cruel world? How could any griff be trusted with political power if they had murdered their emperor, their own spiritual embodiment? Questions like these flew through his head as he looked upon his father.\n\nBut there was something new that grew in Barnabys stomach, something that had not been there before: some kind of stoic resolve. His father had taken the easy way out, to be united with his emperor in Boreas wings, but somebody would need to stay and take care of the worldly matters. This injustice could not stand, and he was called by fate itself to rectify it.\n\nWhile Barnaby stood on his fathers deathbed, word had spread to the Dogs of Bronzehill. Panic had broken out among them, with many seeing the recent events as evidence that the world was to end soon, or worse, that Maar himself had won over the Trinity."

 bronzehill_revenge.3.d:0 "Traditionally, in times of crisis the sitting count was to convene the Bronze Council, made up of the nobledogs of Bronzehill, as well as any dog of political influence that the count saw fit. However, Barnaby decided to ignore this tradition.\n\nOf what use would the old nobledogs be? They were indecisive, weak, and only clung to their old privileges. This was not what Bronzehill needed. In a crisis like this, action was required, as well as unity, something that the nobledogs didn't seem to understand.\n\nIn this light, Barnaby had decided to convene an entirely different sort of council: The Council of Six. The six members would be himself, Winston Copperhill, Rufus Loudbark, Lassie Goldcoat, Rosey Luxembark, and Kimball Barking-Sun. To even attempt to bring these dogs into one room was highly unorthodox, and in different times something like this would have fallen apart within mere minutes. These times were far from normal, however. The dogs in this council of six were the dogs that commanded respect from many different parts of society, and they were also the dogs that had called for action.\n\nAs the first meeting started, it seemed like tension would flare up quickly, but as Barnaby declared that they had a common obligation to bring death to the traitors in Griffenheim, the suspicion and rivalry on the dogs' faces disappeared. Only one emotion remained: the desire for revenge."

A fear that was exceptionally well founded.\n\nAs the army units of Bronzehill fought street by street, their primary target was the Imperial Palace. Dawnclaw had turned it into a fortress, but the dogs were not to be stopped by anything, bringing heavy artillery to shell anything in their path. The morale of the soldiers defending the city broke before the dogs had reached the Imperial Palace, likely in part due to the dogs having a policy of no quarter towards the followers of the "Lord Protector".\n\nAs the armies of the dogs stormed into the palace they were disappointed to find only the dead body of Ferdinand Dawnclaw, but this did not stop them from taking revenge. The dead body was shredded into mincemeat, before being brought out of the city into the woods and fed to the wild animals therein. Nothing of the body would remain, not even the blood stained into the clothes he died in.\n\nEven as the fighting had stopped, units of dogs patrolled through the streets to search for former supporters of the traitor. Anygriff suspected of having supported the previous government was executed, often in gruesome ways, as the dogs indulged their thirst for revenge."

Anyone who spreads the likeness of the unmentionable is to be seen as a devoted worshipper of Maar and to be executed immediately. The method of execution is to be left to the arresting officer, with creativity encouraged. Failing to properly condemn the crimes of Maar himself is to be seen as an act of spreading Maar worship, and any perpetrator is to be flogged publicly so that the common folk may see their lies and keep their soul pure and with Boreas.\n\nThis law has been passed by the Council of Six and takes effect immediately.""

 bronzehill_revenge.7.t:0 "The Future Of The Council"
 bronzehill_revenge.7.d:0 "The primary task of the council had always been to punish the unmentionable and to restore the glory of the Emperor. However, this task was mostly fulfilled - while the great proclamation continued to be carried out and some supporters of the maarspawn still continued to surface, it was clear that the future of the empire needed to be decided.\n\nWhen the Council of Six was formed, all former ideological differences were pushed aside in a common goal, a goal that all dogs could get behind. But now that the view shifted towards the future, differences began to resurface, and would need to be dealt with. One day, a clearly tired Barnaby decided it was time to have an open discussion about this.\n\n"My dear councillors, fate has tested us hard, but we have endured. As we speak, the empire is being rebuilt, even though the noble lineage of Griffonstone will no longer sit upon their rightful throne. Now, we need to speak of the future. What are we to do with the empty throne?"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, before Kimball Barking-Sun answered: "Count Barnaby, I never thought that I might say this, but I think the sitting Count of Bronzehill should act as regent for the future to come. In the past I could not see you as I see you now. You, and anyone in this council, has proven their undying support for our dear leader Grover VI." There was nodding among the other members of the council.\n\n"Then so it shall be. I wish I could feel grateful for this great task, but I feel as empty as the throne is. Still, I will try to do my tasks as regent dutiful and together with this council. Besides that, I would propose that the council will be written in law to consist of the sitting count as well as chairman and deputy of the three parties, the Harmonic-Conservatives, the National Union, and the Socialist Party. Other parties are not needed, as we need no griffon nonsense. \n\n"Such nonsense brings me to my next point: the griffons can not be trusted with their own self interest, that much is evident. I do not know what causes them to be so emotional and self sabotaging, but we must control them. As such it is my belief that we must enact a set of laws to keep them protected, and out of any positions where they can cause further harm. No griffon should hold political office beyond an advisory position, nor should they be able to become military officers. Were it not for the valliant griffon volunteers in the Bronzehill army I'd say they should be barred from military service whatsoever, but at very least they should be exempt from any drafting. Finally, while we can not restore the Empire for Grover's sake anymore, we can liberate the griffons from their own incompetence. I hate war as much as any Bronzehill dog, but to not act is to invite yet more disaster into the world."\n\nThe other members of the council shared an uneasy look, but their faces slowly grew firm as they nodded in agreement."

 bronzehill_revenge.99.t:0 "Doing What Must Be Done"
 bronzehill_revenge.99.d:0 "Another day went by at the Imperial court in Griffenheim. Things had calmed down from the years prior. Griffons buzzed around the court, some of the nobles, some businessgriffs, others simply workers and trade unionist.\n\nThe great throne room in Griffenheim was cast in dim light by the chandaliers hanging form the ceiling. A long velvet carpet led towards the great throne of the Griffonian Empire - but this throne was empty. Besides the throne stood a simple wooden chair, with a dog in simple cloth sitting on it. From looking at him, there was no mark that this dog held any great post in the court. Yet all the visitors of the court spoke to him in a low, serious voice, and he answered them in a similar tone. On first glance, the dog looked old, but if you observed him closer, you could see that his age was little over thirty, if even that. But his attitude was the embodiment of wisedom, paired with a sense of a dog tested by fate.\n\nThe dog on the wooden chair was Barnaby, regent of an empire without an emperor. When the dogs in the Council discussed, Barnaby barely listened, only intervening when they seemed to be unable to reach a conclusion. But Barnaby would serve his emperor, even though said emperor was dead. And after him, his son would serve as regent, then his grandson, great-grandson and so on.

Residential areas, government buildings, noble palaces, even temples. It mattered not what stood in their path: all would be torn down to make way for the only thing that the dogs could actually give to the Emperor: a dignified resting place.\n\nMany griffons protested, some even tried to defend their estates, but the dogs were not willing to play games with these and drove them out by violence if threats did not suffice.

It is the last thing that could be done to enshrine his memory. The best architects were asked to spearhead this colossal project. Many designs had been submitted but finally, after many days of searching, we have found the only design suitable for the place of his Majesty's final rest.\nThe final design showed large, square-like building. With three floors in total, each smaller than the previous, in size. Each level could be made from nothing less than a shiniest white marble. On top of the third and last floor was a spherical roof with a statue of his Majesty on top. Overall stairs-like appearance were to symbolize his Majesty's journey to the heavens and the spherical roof symbolises the paradise where Boreas and his ancestors await him. White marble symbolises his Majesty's purity and innocence.\nThe insides of the mausoleum were divided into three parts. First, the area dedicated to the visitors, divided from the next area by a wall. From there, the stairs lead to the second floor, which had a large glass floor protected from stepping on by railings at the edges. This area was dedicated as the observation room, symbols of the three temples were placed there too. Finally, from here, the visiting grievers could gaze through the floor to the third area. The third area had been sealed away to protect his Majesty's embalmed body. The Imperial crown and his closest possessions had been buried with him in there, along with the treasures and gifts from his people.

Across the pond, war memorials recounted the names of all who died to avenge the young emperor. The road got narrower the closer it got to the Mausoleum, emphasising the size of the structure.

Those sixty influential figures that sook to eliminate the unmentionable before he could kill the emperor or those that fought in his name in the immediate aftermath.

Bronzehill sent their best artists to enrich the last emperor's final resting place with the art that came from the soul of our country.

None were forgotten and their names were carved into the stone of the foundations. Now that the work had been finished, it was finally time for the ceremony. The funeral of the Grover VI.\n\nWhen the day arrived, the entire city slowed to a standstill. It was a public holiday all across Herzland, and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of citizens had arrived to take part in the proceedings. Soon the streets were filled to the brim with griffons and diamond dogs, and almost every single one of them carried a candle, lit in remembrance of the Emperor. The citizens solemnly and quietly marched to the center of the city, towards the vast memorial complex. There, countless soldiers of the new Imperial Army stood, immobile like statues, facing the mausoleum. The citizens gathered behind them and around them and waited.\n\nThe main funeral procession then departed the Imperial Palace. The path was lined with candle-holding spectators as the thousands of Imperial servants, diamond dogs, soldiers and others escorted the Emperor's coffin, chanting sorrowful religious songs. At the head of the column was regent Barnaby himself, his head hung low in sorrow. All of them were wearing black clothes.\n\nThe procession proceeded towards the mausoleum itself. The huge crowd watched in complete silence as the coffin was carried by Imperial Knights inside the darkness of the tomb-complex itself. Soon the knights returned without the coffin, and a hundred diamond dogs pushed a gigantic stone slab to seal the tomb for all eternity. There was a loud thump, and then complete, harrowing silence."

When he was five years old, he travelled to the Imperial City to see Grover V's coronation and was enamoured by the splendour. He returned to the city many times and studied there at Emperor's College, gaining a degree in politics.\n\nHe became a close friend of the Emperor, who attended his wedding to Izzy Bones-Iron, daughter of the Lord Gems. With her he has had two children, Barnaby and Margaret.\n\nDuring his rule he has been a competent administrator and a beloved defender of Bronzehill and the Emperor, however his policies on supporting Griffon industry over Bronzehill's own has led to the formation of several communist organisations in Bronzehill. And while he has the full support of the Bronze Council, there are those who question his ability to lead effectively should Bronzehill be faced by a disaster such as the Republican Uprising during his father's reign.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

His village was Dogish-speaking, something which is looked down upon in wider Bronzehill, and he recieved only token education as a child. At the age of 14 years, he started to work in the coal mines, where he formulated his ideology, based on a combination of folk stories and communist agitation which had spread into the mines. After joining a underground trade union, he learned to read and write in secret, while also becoming a local agitator and organizator.\n\nBarking-Suns political believes, especially with respect to the Griffonstone dynasty, are controversial among not only the wider socialist community (which rejects many of his views outright), but even inside of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill. However, through dedication and hard work, he has won his place in the party - and after overthrowing the \"liberal\" Luxembark, he can finally put his theory into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

 BRZ_LUXEMBARK_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th March 961, Pfotenhausen, Bronzehill.\n\n§YBiography§!: Rosey Luxembark was born in Pfotenhausen as sixth and youngest child of wood trader Mattheus Luxembark. Her family had mainline monarchist political beliefs and promoted a universal education, with her learning literature from an early age. In her youth, she saw the brutal exploitation and horrors capitalism and feudalism brought. She came to hate the tyrants, and in her young adulthood she wrote polemic after polemic against them, calling for their violent overthrow and for them to face the workers' justice--but never the Emperor. To her, the Emperor was a good griff misled by wicked advisors about the true state of his Empire, and if he found out he'd execute them all on the spot.\n\nHer father used his modest prosperity to enable Rosey and her five brothers to study in the prestigious universities of southern Herzland, where she enrolled to study economics, engineering, sociology and biology. During her studies, she learned more of the deep relationship between the Emperor and his nobility, and suffered a brief crisis of faith. As she grappled with the fact that the Emperor was simply the noble-in-chief, she came to moderate her positions. Still a socialist, she now promoted the thought that old institutions could be kept as figureheads, something that she called \"institutional continuity\". To help her fellow comrades, she decided to switch to study law.\n\nBack in Bronzehill, she was a founding member of the Socialist Party, becoming its second chairdog after August Barken. Among fellow socialists, her pro-monarchy views are a continuous topic of controversy. However, few griffons and dogs of Herzland can deny her commitment to the workers' movement, democratic reform and socialist theory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

He was accepted into the Guards, the elite unite of Bronzehill, initially as an infanterist. After five years, he was transferred to the artillerists and got a promotion, but only to Unterwachtmeister.\n\nDuring his time in the military, Loudbark joined the National Union, which was initially mostly aimed at soldiers. He quickly rose through the party ranks due to his oratory skill. After becoming its chairdog in 1004, he has extended the party's platform and promoted the populist Lassie Goldcoat to be his deputy, appealing also to rural and nationalist dogs.

He grew up as a member of Bronzehill's elite during the peaceful reign of Emperor Grover IV.

He was often controversial with his desire for social reform and his support of local Bronzehill businesses over Imperial ones. He was a founding member of the Harmonic Conservative Party and sort to bring greater representation of the common hound into the Bronze Council.\n\nDuring the Republican Uprising he was temporary promoted to Oberstleutnant, although did not participate in the fight to restore the Emperor to the throne. The event however convinced him that the only way to ensure the safety of the Emperor is to make Bronzehill strong and ready to fight. A rallying call that has put him at odds with many even in his own party. But his stubbornness and oratory talent have kept him at the forefront of politics.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Flake"

This finally gave Copperhill the opportunity to make his loyal follower the vice-chairdog of the HKP.

Becoming acolyte at just 14 years, she steadily climbed in the hierarchy, getting a stipend to study theology and finally becoming priestess at impressively young 22 years. Archon Eros followed her carrier with great interest, assigning her to various temples across Herzland. In 984, he finally sent her to Ravensburg, to serve as the Prelate for Bronzehill.\n\nHere, she soon established herself as influential political figure, spreading support for the Emperor, for the temples and for the nobility.

His business was quite successful, he started to invest also in the refining industry. The "Hüttenwerke Goudtand" grew from there, eventually becoming the largest ore mining business in the whole country.\n\nHis success has earned him both friends and enemies, as many dogs still see him as an "outsider", and despite being a dog some see him barely better than the usual businessgriff. However, by now he has lived in Bronzehill for more than 20 years, trying his best to integrate into the local culture.

Her early life was dominated by poverty, and so she joined the communist agitation groups active in the area at the early age of 14 years. She immediately turned out to be a capable agent and excellent at both disguising herself and uncovering infiltrators. However, after three years she left the agitation group to find her luck in the bigger cities of Kaza-Gull, where she joined the police. Here, her talent was quickly discovered and she was trained as a secret investigator for the police.\n\nDespite her young years, her talent is unquestionable to everybody she worked with, and now she has shown interest in building up a spy agency for the armed forces. However, as she says, she doesn't work for any ideological considerations, but purely for the thrill of planning and executing a mission – to play a game of high risk and high reward."
 # Character Note: Sweep Stake is a little bit of a dog supremacist, and not so loyal to the Griffonstone dynasty. However, as no other dog shares this

He, as well as his two siblings, all joined the police, where he quickly got a reputation of "getting stuff done". However, his approaches have not always been conventional. While he is a skilled investigator, giving honour to his family name, the operations that he commanded where often done with an unusual amount of force. But in these operations he also showed a great deal of personal courage that has earned him the respect of his fellow policedogs. Rising through the carrier ladder, he has now found himself to be the chief of the entire police, a job which he fulfils proudly.\n\nDespite that, he is not overly attached to the court in Bronzekreuz – while he receives little love from the socialists he helped oppress for such a long time, he has never personally spoken out against them, and only fulfilled the orders he was given, or so he tells."

Her family didn't have enough money to send her to university, and so Johanna decided to follow her mother's footsteps and started a career as bureaucrat.\n\nHer job was hard and unrewarding. As minor administrator she had to enforce laws that she disagreed with, the people she looked over didn't appreciate her works and her higher-ups only ever bemoaned the "trouble" that occasionally arose when she tried to follow the laws.\n\nHowever, all of this changed suddenly after the dogs of Bronzehill took Griffenheim and [BRZ.GetLeader] was made Imperial regent. She was ordered to Griffenheim and had to rebuild the department for economic development from scratch. With more freedom at paw, she showed a good talent in making friends with both her superiors and her subordinates. She also proved to have good mathematical and organizational skills, certainly necessary for the leader of an increasingly important department.\n\nAnd as her latest achievement, she was entrusted to plan and implement the "Imperial Economic Development Initiative".
