# General remarks for writers: 
# Please use International (Standard/Oxford) English, also called British English. Please do not use American English.
# As Bronzehill is a Herzlander (German) speaking nation, you might want to use some German words for flavour or immersion. Please do this rarely and only for single words that represent important concepts (examples: Volksreligion (= People's religion) for Luxembark or Wehrsportspiele (=Military/Defence sport games) for Loudbark). If you do not speak German, ping HerrB on discord to help you out.
# Some parts of Bronzehill speak also Dogish (Khuzdul). However, Dogish words should only be used exceptionally rarely, if at all. Please ping HerrB on discord to confirm that the lore fits. Please remember that Dogish is a minority language even among the dogs of Bronzehill, only spoken by ~25% of the population, with ~95% (also) speaking Herzlander.
# Thank you! - HerrB

 # Starting
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Finish The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The \"Grover V Industrial Park\" is the name given to large industrial park near Ravensburg. It is almost ready to be opened, but the dam to generate the electricity had been plagued by problems for the last month. It is time to put in the effort and finish this."
 
 BRZ_paving_the_roads:0 "Paving The Roads"
 BRZ_paving_the_roads_desc:0 "Now that the new industrial park is open, we have to make the most out of it. The roads around Ravensburg could use some better paving, so that goods can flow in and out of the industrial park. We will get to work."
 
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers:0 "Invite Griffenheim Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers_desc:0 "While the Grover V Industrial Park surely is a good investment, we need to be prepared for any future trouble. We will invite engineers from Griffenheim to work and live in Ravensburg, so that we can keep the park operational if a catastrophy like 978 would shake the empire again."
 
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Contracts With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "Why should we stop here? With the Grover V Industrial Park starting to be a success story, this can only mean good things for the Bronzehill economy. Our dear Count Ignatius will sign even more contracts will companies from Griffenheim."

 # Autonomist side
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Nationalize The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "It was utter insanity to allow the park to be operated in the way it was. Herzlander companies bought out more and more of the Bronzehillian economy, and our government only watched it happen. We will fix that, starting with the park itself."
 
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production:0 "Increase Domestic Food Production"
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production_desc:0 "In the past, most of Bronzehill's food was imported from wider Herzland, as we focused on mining and refining ores. With our trade relationships with other Herzland nations souring in the wake of our new political situation, we need to increase domestic production."
 
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy:0 "Diversify Bronzehill's Economy"
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy_desc:0 "Our economy needs to be able to stand more autonomous. It is not enough for us to focus on iron and steel anymore, if we can't reliably trade it for other goods. Our focus should be to diversify our industry, and luckily for us, the now nationalized Grover V industrial park can be used to do that."
 
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net:0 "Build A Social Safety Net"
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net_desc:0 "There is still a lingering economic crisis in Bronzehill, and many dogs still are destitute. Our help to these dogs will be doubly beneficial: Not only will we get more better fed, thus more productive workers, but also increased domestic demand, something that will help our economy to prosper again."
 
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust:0 "The Bronzehill Steel Trust"
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust_desc:0 "There are many steel producers in Bronzehill, and not a small amount of them are either still in the claws of businessgriffs or freshly nationalized. Yet, they are struggling as our exports are not doing great. Unifying them into a steel trust, the "Vereinigte Stahlwerke", will help us profit from our steel again."
 
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "Much of our steel industry is still held by private investors, both domestic and foreign. This can no longer stand! The workers demand that we give them control, so that the rich capitalists profit of their work no longer. Instead, the steel industry will be combined into the "Kombinat Kaza-Gull"."
 
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds:0 "Increase Engineering Funds"
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds_desc:0 "Our domestic production still suffers from a lack of industrial engineers. Our production methods are outdated, our industrial sectors run off old machinery and our output is trailing other nations in Herzland. Giving new funds to train and attract engineers can only help us here."
 
 BRZ_underground_factories:0 "Underground Factories"
 BRZ_underground_factories_desc:0 "Diamond dogs have a long history of living underground. While we in Bronzehill have partially adapted to the griffon way of live, we still can use the plenty of caves to create more room for factories. Coincidentally, these factories are also quite well protected against bombs from the air."
 
 BRZ_economic_planning_office:0 "Economic Planning Office"
 BRZ_economic_planning_office_desc:0 "For Bronzehill to have a strong and stable domestic industrial sector, we need to invest in proper management and planning. With the right ideas of land use, we can fetch some more factory locations from our limited lands."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_strong_and_free:0 "Bronzehill Strong And Free"
 BRZ_bronzehill_strong_and_free_desc:0 "With the reforms to our industry, we can proudly proclaim that Bronzehill no longer needs to hide about its industrial progress. Proudly we march into the future, free from foreign influence, strong from our own work."
 
 # Shared
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget:0 "Expand The Rural School Budget"
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget_desc:0 "Our education system still doesn't reach many of the small villages in Bronzehill, particularly in the mountains. Already under Count Georgie, the Rural School Program was initiated to alleviate the situation. Even though things have improved, the program still suffers from insufficient funding and a lack of teachers. It's high time to change that."
 
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers:0 "Invite Electronic Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers_desc:0 "One area where Bronzehill is particularly lacking is in the new and coming sector of electronics. If we want to improve our research, we need more talent in this sector."
 
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home:0 "Our Talents At Home"
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home_desc:0 "It would be wrong to entirely ignore what talent we already have at home. We are Diamond Dogs, not Griffons, and we should make use of what we are good at. New specialists should research about our own abilities, so that we can use them best."
 
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Found The Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "Bronzehill is so poor in scientist, that we don't even have our own domestic university. But with the recent influx of talent, attracted by our various programs, we finally have everything together to found our very own university for research and education, here in our capital."
 
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system:0 "Modernize The Education System"
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system_desc:0 "Our education system still suffers from being outdated on various topics. With new capacities to educate teachers here in Bronzehill, we should make sure that these teachers have all the tools they need and a up-to-date curriculum at paw."
 
 # Loyalty side
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl:0 "Negotiations With Krähe-Stahl"
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl_desc:0 "Now that the political situation is somewhat under control, we can resume our long task of resolving Bronzehill's economic crisis. A first step in this is to negotiate with Krähe-Stahl, one of the main operators of the Grover V Industrial Park."
 
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system:0 "Liberalize The Banking System"
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system_desc:0 "Bronzehill needs investment; there can be little doubt about that. To further our economic development, we will liberalize certain laws regarding credits and securities... hopefully this will convince some banks that we are worth an investment."
 
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth:0 "Give Support To Goldtooth"
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth_desc:0 "Max Goldtooth is one of the richest, if not the richest griffons in Bronzehill. Of course he is from Griffenheim and some dogs loath him for that. But he has built a large industrial conglomerate here, has invested more than a claw full of idols into the industrial district and most importantly, he is living in Bronzekreuz. Supporting his enterprises is good for us all."
 
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength:0 "Utilize Our Strength"
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength_desc:0 "Invest in your strength, and supplant your weaknesses, this should be our motto. Yes, we dogs are not as skilled in agriculture as other species might be, but we all the more skilled in our mining business that we are famous for. Let us use that."
 
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry:0 "Industrial Cooperation With Strawberry"
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry_desc:0 "In our new position, Strawberry is getting ever more important as trading partner. Several of their investors have shown interest in forming a group to organize their investment in Bronzehill. This is something we should further, so that our economy can profit."
 
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus:0 "Krähe-Stahl Bronzehill"
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus_desc:0 "Krähe-Stahl, the famous industrial conglomerate from Griffenheim, has agreed to officially open a branch office in Bronzekreuz. We will grant them large economic freedoms in exchange for steady investment."
 
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Expand The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park might have had a slow start, but it is now showing definite signs of success. The hydroelectric power from the Ravensburg dam is used almost completely, but this cannot stop us. We will expand the park by building new power plants."
 
 BRZ_foreign_investment_management_bureau:0 "Foreign Investment Management Bureau"
 BRZ_foreign_investment_management_bureau_desc:0 "The influx of foreign investment into Bronzehill is certainly helping us out quite a lot. But we need to keep track of who does what and for which purpose, otherwise we will end in economic chaos. Also, the investors still need to pay taxes to us."
 
 BRZ_urbanize_the_south:0 "Urbanize The South"
 BRZ_urbanize_the_south_desc:0 "The fertile strip of land in our south, from Hundsfeld to Ravensburg, is starting to become the economic lifeblood of Bronzehill. This is good, and we should encourage it, therefore we should expand the cities in the area."
 
 BRZ_prospering_together:0 "Prospering Together"
 BRZ_prospering_together_desc:0 "Bronzehill doesn't stand alone in Herzland, but is part of a vast network of trade routes and mutual investments. Good, we say! We shall prosper together with the rest of Herzland, just as all dogs within our nation also shall prosper together."
 
 BRZ_drill_for_oil_under_crownspike:0 "Drill For Oil Under Crownspike"
 BRZ_drill_for_oil_under_crownspike_desc:0 "Some unusual scents have been picked up by the noses of our skilled prospectors. While we are mostly concerned with gems and ores, this time we have struck oil. And in a changing industrial environment, oil is the new, black gold."
 
 ## Imperial Industrial
 
 BRZ_rebuild_the_imperial_bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild The Imperial Economy"
 BRZ_rebuild_the_imperial_bureaucracy_desc:0 "After our conquest of Griffenheim, the bureaucracy is in tatters. Our officials from Bronzekreuz work overtime, but an Empire requires an administration on an entirely different scale from a simple county."
 
 BRZ_political_background_checks:0 "Political Background Checks"
 BRZ_political_background_checks_desc:0 "It is quite clear that we will not be able to continue without incorporation at least some parts of the old administration into our ranks. But if we do so, we should tread carefully – we should not accidentally admit traitors into our ranks."
 
 BRZ_train_new_clerks:0 "Train New Clerks"
 BRZ_train_new_clerks_desc:0 "We need more people in our administration. Many jobs there don't require extensive training, we just need dog or griffons willing to work for us. Let us fill in these easier positions, then we can think about the higher-ups."
 
 BRZ_review_the_legal_codes:0 "Review The Legal Codes"
 BRZ_review_the_legal_codes_desc:0 "An orderly society needs clear legal codes, there can be little doubt about it. However, at the moment we have a total mess of legal structures, with Bronzehill statutes and old Imperial statutes all mixed together, and nocreature knows what actually applies."
 
 BRZ_construct_the_central_office:0 "Construct The Central Office"
 BRZ_construct_the_central_office_desc:0 "Here at the heart of the Empire in Griffenheim, we will put the heart of our administration. With this massive investment, we should be able to properly administer the Empire and enforce the will of the Emperor."
 
 BRZ_the_heart_of_the_heartlands:0 "The Heart Of The Heartlands"
 BRZ_the_heart_of_the_heartlands_desc:0 "If we wish to bind all industry of the Empire together, we need a strong industrial heart to support it. However, at the moment the area around our capital looks a bit lacklustre – something that we need to change."
 
 BRZ_the_imperial_high_speed_rail:0 "The Imperial High-Speed Rail"
 BRZ_the_imperial_high_speed_rail_desc:0 "A grand rail network for the Empire is not exactly a new idea – however, in the past any and all plans were foiled by unsupportive vassals, bureaucratic hassles or simply a lack of funding. Now, we have the technology and the will to finally realize the project on a large scale."
 
 BRZ_support_the_countryside:0 "Connect The Countryside"
 BRZ_support_the_countryside_desc:0 "The Imperial High-Speed Rail is a huge success, allowing for fast transportation of goods and people between major cities. However, many areas across the Empire have few towns and cities that could ever hope to have the IHSR come to them – we need to give them our support, too."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_food_supply:0 "Secure The Food Supply"
 BRZ_secure_the_food_supply_desc:0 "Our Empire is not only growing by its borders as we reconquer our rightful lands. As peace and prosperity return to our lands, we also experience a boom of cubs, pups and foals. We need to improve our farming further, so that our nation will never go hungry."
 
 BRZ_mass_motorization:0 "Mass Motorization"
 BRZ_mass_motorization_desc:0 "Motorization in the form of trucks and trains is important, both for our military and our population. But our motorization can go so much further. We need to build up industries to supply more engines, more cars and more trains."
 
 BRZ_revitalize_the_economy:0 "Revitalize The Economy"
 BRZ_revitalize_the_economy_desc:0 "The wars in Herzland and beyond have ravaged the economy of the Empire. As we rebuild the Empire, we likewise need to rebuild its economy, to secure our long-term strength."
 
 BRZ_our_natural_talent:0 "Our Natural Talent"
 BRZ_our_natural_talent_desc:0 "Diamond dogs are known for their ability to sniff out valuable metals and gems from the mountains.

 BRZ_expedition_to_the_northern_mountains:0 "Expedition To The Northern Mountains"
 BRZ_expedition_to_the_northern_mountains_desc:0 "The mountains of Cloudbury and Sunstriker, while already being exploited for some minerals, still have great potential. An expedition of diamond dogs can show us were to dig - and we will dig, a lot."
 
 BRZ_new_industrial_centres:0 "New Industrial Centres"

 BRZ_lights_of_griffonia:0 "Lights Of Griffonia"
 BRZ_lights_of_griffonia_desc:0 "The various great cities of Griffonia, like Griffonstone, Aquila or Kathrin have all been affected by the wars to reconquer the Empire.

 BRZ_the_imperial_passport:0 "The Imperial Passport"
 BRZ_the_imperial_passport_desc:0 "Passports are a relatively new phenomenon in the Herzlands. But as soon as they took off, local fiefdoms and administrations issued all sorts of passports or identification documents, creating a total mess. In an effort to massively simplify this bloated system, we will introduce the Imperial passport, to slowly replace all others."
 
 BRZ_standardized_measurement_system:0 "Standardized Measurement System"
 BRZ_standardized_measurement_system_desc:0 "The various lands that have found their way back into the Empire still use their local units of measurement. These local units introduce all kinds of barriers to trade and economic cooperation. To fix this, we will introduce a new, standarized measurement system build on new scientific understandings: The metric system."
 
 BRZ_support_the_electronic_industry:0 "Support The Electronic Industry"
 BRZ_support_the_electronic_industry_desc:0 "The various applications of electronic devices show that this technology has limitless potential. We need more industry to produce electronics, be it radios, artificial lights or electric engines.

 ## Military Initial
 
 BRZ_military_budget_review:0 "Review The Military Budget"
 BRZ_military_budget_review_desc:0 "The current crisis in the Empire has the potential to cause strife, if not outright war. While Bronzehill has traditionally maintained only a small army, the coming times could force us to change our approach quite drastically."
 
 BRZ_home_defence:0 "Home Defence"
 BRZ_home_defence_desc:0 "If Bronzehill should really get involved in a future war, we need to focus on defending our homes from the invaders. Let us prepare defensive plans on how we could stall any possible invading force."
 
 BRZ_western_defence_line:0 "Western Defence Line"
 BRZ_western_defence_line_desc:0 "The first step in our plan to protect Bronzehill is to build a defensive line running north to south, protecting Bronzekreuz and the lands behind it. The northern mountains would be used for defence, otherwise we will build behind the river."
 
 BRZ_southern_defence_line:0 "Southern Defence Line"
 BRZ_southern_defence_line_desc:0 "The southern defence line is for the worst case scenario – an attack from Griffenheim. Luckily, we can make use of the natural lakes and rivers, running a defence line from Pfotenhausen in the West through Hundsfeld and Ravensburg until we hit the Hellquillian border on the east."
 
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies:0 "Protecting Our Skies"
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies_desc:0 "The cruelties of air warfare are beginning to show themselves in the conflicts we hear about in the wider world. As we know that many nations that surround us are also building an air fleet, we need to invest in counter measures."
 
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat:0 "The Mountain Retreat"
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat_desc:0 "We dogs are people of the mountains. While many of our cities are built above the ground, every dog can still go underground if we need to.

 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy:0 "Challenge Our Legacy"
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy_desc:0 "The population of Bronzehill has always viewed war with horror. Violent behaviour was associated with the crimes of the Diamond Mountain slavers, something that was shunned in Bronzehill. However, we need to remind the dogs that someday the Emperor could call us to arms again – then we should not cower away."
 
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill:0 "The Army Of Bronzehill"
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill_desc:0 "We need to review the state of our current land forces. Their equipment is as outdated as their fighting tactics – we have a long way to go before our army is truly ready for combat."
 
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns:0 "Modernize Our Guns"
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns_desc:0 "The army of Bronzehill still operates with many old guns. We should do a concentrated effort to develop newer, more powerful guns, otherwise we will fall behind in combat capability."
 
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion:0 "Cannons Are Our Passion"
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion_desc:0 "Bronzehill is famous for its metals, and not too long ago, was also one of the prime producers of cannons for the empire. Yet, we have rarely used these guns for ourselves, nor have we produced them as much since the revolution. But we should get back on track."
 
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain:0 "Our Natural Terrain"
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain_desc:0 "As diamond dogs, we live in the mountains – literally in the mountains sometimes. As such, we have developed a very fine sense of how to operate here. If our enemies can't counter this, we should use it."
 
 BRZ_proper_support_for_our_troops:0 "Proper Support For Our Troops"
 BRZ_proper_support_for_our_troops_desc:0 "With storm troops alone we won't be able to overcome the enemy. Our divisions also need various supporting elements, like engineers, field hospitals or reconnaissance. We should focus on including these in our division, to maximize efficiency."
 
 BRZ_cannons_on_wheels:0 "Cannons On Wheels"
 BRZ_cannons_on_wheels_desc:0 "Other nations have already done it, and we should follow soon: Putting our cannons on top of mightily armoured vehicles. This way, we can have firepower that is much more flexible when approaching the enemy."
 
 BRZ_rework_our_training_routine:0 "Rework Our Training Routine"
 BRZ_rework_our_training_routine_desc:0 "In peace times, it is all too common for our troops to become complacent. And for good reason, for the longest time they were just a better police force. However, now we need well trained, combat-ready soldiers, so we need to intensify our training."
 
 BRZ_update_our_tactics:0 "Update Our Tactics"
 BRZ_update_our_tactics_desc:0 "One of the most crucial things in combat is to employ the right tactics. This mostly comes with experience, however by studying the wars around us in the world, we might still be able to learn quite a bit of useful insight."
 
 BRZ_bronzehills_special_recipe:0 "Bronzehill's Special Recipe"
 BRZ_bronzehills_special_recipe_desc:0 "When the enemies approach our tanks, they will soon notice why we are called diamond dogs. No other species can claim to be so good at treating metals as we are."
 
 BRZ_electronic_support:0 "Electronic Support"
 BRZ_electronic_support_desc:0 "The advancements made in electronics have certainly impacted the way future wars will be fought. The newest invention is the so-called RADAR technology which would help us to spot enemy forces in advance. We should invest in it."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad:0 "A Bronzehill Air Squad"
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad_desc:0 "We dogs have not a natural ability to fly like the griffons do, but all the more should we be interested in the developments of airplanes. Let us establish a Bronzehill air squad by procuring a few airplanes from friendly sources in Herzland."
 
 BRZ_upgrade_our_fighters:0 "Upgrade Our Fighters"
 BRZ_upgrade_our_fighters_desc:0 "While we have procured some fighters from abroad, and also have the knowledge of building more, our fighters still don't do well in comparison to what others armies can field. An investment into research on various components will seriously enhance the capabilities of our fighters."
 
 BRZ_bombs_from_above:0 "Bombs From Above"
 BRZ_bombs_from_above_desc:0 "To be able to drop bombs on our enemies from above is an incredibly powerful tool, if used right. We need to further our knowledge on the components involved, so that our enemies may shiver in fear when they see our bombers approach."
 
 BRZ_bronzehills_air_factories:0 "Bronzehill's Air Factories"
 BRZ_bronzehills_air_factories_desc:0 "To further our air force, we need additional capabilities to building more planes. A new industrial project centred on producing planes can deliver what our army needs."

 BRZ_the_new_reichsarmee_desc:0 "We have taken Griffenheim, and now we are the loyal regents of the great Emperor. But the old framework of the Bronzehill army is proving more and more insufficient – we need to reconstitute our army as the one, true Reichsarmee."

 BRZ_dogs_on_the_high_sees_desc:0 "Now that we have finally gained access to the coast we can answer the call of the high seas and restart the Imperial Navy! First up on the docket gathering the saltiest sea dogs and griffs we can find to command our fleets."
 
 BRZ_hire_more_naval_talents:0 "Upscaling the Admiralty"
 BRZ_hire_more_naval_talents_desc:0 "Integrating disparate organizations is never easy.

 BRZ_extend_our_reach_desc:0 "In this new age of combined arms warfare some of our strategists are of the opinion that dreadnaughts and super-heavy class hulls are becoming obsolete. Perhaps it is time we put our talons to the grind stone and show them the error of their ways."

 BRZ_upgrade_our_naval_cannons_desc:0 "What do you do if you apply overwhelming firepower to the problem and it persists? Well the most obvious answer is to simply use more gun!"

 BRZ_deep_sea_hunters_desc:0 "With the dominance of capital ships on the high seas only growing by the day we need to invest into more subaquatic firepower if we want to maintain naval superiority. Fortunately our canine familiarity with subterranean warfare can help us advance our subaquatic doctrines and designs."
 
 BRZ_amphibious_operations:0 "Amphibious Operations"
 BRZ_amphibious_operations_desc:0 "Semi-aquatic action! Wait a second... what do amphibious landings even look like with natural flight involved? Perhaps we should just invest in some army-wide surveys to see if we can't make this whole process more efficient."
 
 BRZ_ramp_up_plane_production:0 "Ramping Up Plane Production"
 BRZ_ramp_up_plane_production_desc:0 "Turns out collating field reports from the Imperial Airforce's pilots and manufacturing expertise from Imperium's best forge workers has allowed us to streamline production in some key areas. Perhaps, we should organize meetings like this more often..."
 
 BRZ_the_air_academy:0 "The Air Academy"
 BRZ_the_air_academy_desc:0 "Griffons were born to fly and griffons invented the airplane. Their natural instincts make them unparalleled flyers, just as they learn from us when it comes to tunneling. Luckily the ace griffs of the Imperial Airforce have a lot of old tricks they can teach these new dogs."
 
 BRZ_swimming_airbases:0 "Floating Airbases"
 BRZ_swimming_airbases_desc:0 "Our Airforce is one of our most valuable assets and the sea is an entire front that could be perfect for launching offensives, but alas there isn't a single airport in sight. Some of the engineers have been talking... What do you think about the idea of floating airbases?"
 
 BRZ_rolling_thunder:0 "Rolling Thunder"

 BRZ_combined_arms_operations:0 "Combined Arms Operations"
 BRZ_combined_arms_operations_desc:0 "Infantry. Armor. Trucks. Fighters. Bombers. CAS. All of these forces make up the might of the Reichsarmee! They would all be useless without proper co-ordination, thus it is only natural that we should invest in sprucing up our combat doctrines to include a more well rounded point of view."
 
 BRZ_faster_tanks:0 "Specialization: Engines"
 BRZ_faster_tanks_desc:0 "Despite advances in armored vehicle design we are approaching the limits of feasibility for realistic production times. It's time to specialize. Our drivers have been pleading for better engines for a while now and we have finally hear their calls, that means higher top speeds and more reliability under pressure."
 
 BRZ_heavier_tanks:0 "Specialization: Armor"
 BRZ_heavier_tanks_desc:0 "Despite advances in armored vehicle design we are approaching the limits of feasibility for realistic production times. It's time to specialize. Our tank crews deserve to fight secure in the knowledge that we value their lives above all else and so increasing overall durability and reliability of parts is paramount."
 
 BRZ_logistical_support:0 "Logistical Support"
 BRZ_logistical_support_desc:0 "Chief among the lessons we've learned on the ever-shifting frontlines of war is the importance of upkeeping our logistical supply chains. Without the hard work of our noble logistics griffs the Reichsarmee's ammo boxes would run dry and the enemy wouldn't get their free lead exports!"

 BRZ_the_search_for_adamant_desc:0 "Throughout the ages the mystery material known as Adamantium has been wielded by heroes that changed our world, but what if we could harness that power for ourselves?

 BRZ_an_unusual_guest_desc:0 "Count Ignatius is not the only one who is interested in potential councillors. Barnaby had an idea of his own, and has invited an unusual guest into Bronzehill Castle, to discuss some things that Ignatius doesn't need to know about - for now at least."
 
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark is the chairdog of the militarist and populist National Union, and fully lives up to his name. But in this matter, Count Ignatius preferes a more calm environment, for some things need to be discussed discretely."
 
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills:0 "Up In The Hills"
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills_desc:0 "Not all power in Bronzehills comes from the palace. Even though the Count rules absolute, there are plenty of dogs who hold little loyalty to him. And one of them had just found out very interesting details to think about."
 
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg_desc:0 "The prelate of Bronzehill, located in Ravensburg, is normally only concerned with religious matters. However, in times when the socialist movement openly defies the will of Boreas, it is hard to stay out of politics."
 
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas:0 "Barnaby's Ideas"
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas_desc:0 "The final list of councillors is almost complete. All the political factions in Bronzehill have found their place in the council. Or have they? Crown Prince Barnaby think that Ignatius has forgotten something, but Barnaby has already an idea."
 
 BRZ_the_councils_opens:0 "The Council Opens"
 BRZ_the_councils_opens_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council has been called. Count Ignatius will open the council with a speach to the councillors, and then Prince Barnaby will oversee the deliberation of the council.

 BRZ_old_loyalties_desc:0 "We have decided to dismiss the vote of the Bronzehill Council. The dogs will prove their loyalty to the emperor not by trying to overthrow his regency, but by fighting along them for the glory of the empire."

 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile:0 "The Regent In Exile"
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has become regent in Griffenheim, much to the dismay of the nobility, including Count Ignatius.

 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter:0 "Trip To Readewetter"
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter_desc:0 "If we want to support Gabriela in overthrowing the Archon and taking the regency, we need to formalize our alliance as soon as possible. Count Ignatius will personally travel to Readewetter to meet Gabriela and to discuss further details."
 
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp:0 "Work With The HKP"
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp_desc:0 "In contrast to the radicals from the Socialists or the National Union, the Harmonic-Conservatives are not a fundamental thread to Bronzehill.

 BRZ_purge_the_high_command:0 "Purge The High Command"
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command_desc:0 "The high command has shown a disturbingly close relationship with Loudbark's National Union.

 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate:0 "Help From The Prelate"
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Gunhild is not too happy that we have thrown our support behind Gabriela – as appointee from Eros, she argued in favour of his regency.

 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights:0 "Loyalty Of The Knights"
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights_desc:0 "Much like Gunhild, Grandmaster Lucky from the Knights of Bronzekreuz has shown a preference for Eros.

 BRZ_gather_noble_support:0 "Gather Noble Support"
 BRZ_gather_noble_support_desc:0 "The nobles of Bronzehill are the fundament of our rule, now more than ever. Yet a surprising amount of nobles seems to be rather passive, instead of openly supporting the Count. We have to remind them of what is at stake here."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_desc:0 "With our rule secured, we can finally proclaim the crisis to be over and send the councillors home. They have been an obstacle to our goals for long enough."
 
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry:0 "Trade With Strawberry"
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry_desc:0 "After we have favoured Gabriela over Eros, our trade with Griffenheim has predictably taken a hit. However, our alliance with Strawberry also includes various economic treaties. It is high time we act on these treaties and bring our economy back on track."
 
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts:0 "Renegotiate Industrial Contracts"
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts_desc:0 "At the time we negotiated with Krähe-Stahl and other companies from Griffenheim over future investment in Bronzehill, nodog could have seen coming that we would break with Griffenheim. But it has happened, and now we have to secure our economy. We will approach them to renegotiate some of the clauses in our investment pacts."
 
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support:0 "Rebuild Popular Support"

 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares:0 "Shuffle Industrial Shares"
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares_desc:0 "Not all companies that we have investment agreements with are from Griffenheim.

 BRZ_in_defence_of_tradition:0 "In Defence Of Tradition"
 BRZ_in_defence_of_tradition_desc:0 "It is important to remember for every dog that we fight for a just cause: Against theocratic radicalism and for the trusted rule of the nobility. We will spread the message across Bronzehill, so that every dog can see why we stand against Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors:0 "Invite Yale Professors"
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors_desc:0 "Bronzehill's academia is quite small in comparison to the intellectual centres in Herzland. To improve our research efforts, we will invite griffon professors from Greenback and Yale.

 BRZ_the_rightful_regent:0 "The Rightful Regent"
 BRZ_the_rightful_regent_desc:0 "Our bonds to Griffenheim will not be shaken, regardless of whom the wise griffons of Grover's court choose as regent. The dogs of Bronzehill are there to serve the emperor, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim:0 "Envoy To Griffenheim"
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "We have thrown our full support behind the rightful regent, but this does not solve our political crisis at home yet. When we send an official envoy to Griffenheim it will not only show the empire our admiration, but also serve as a warning to our political opponents at home."
 
 BRZ_gather_the_knights:0 "Gather The Knights"
 BRZ_gather_the_knights_desc:0 "Grandmaster Lucky of the Knights of Bronzekreuz has already expressed interest in taking on the problem with the socialists in our country. We have long been hesitant, but in our new situation, we need decisive action. Grandmaster Lucky can deliver that."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility:0 "Unite The Nobility"
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility_desc:0 "We should not forget that a fair few nobles in the council seemed to favour the notion of a Bronzehill regency. But now that the matter is decided, we need to unite the nobles behind us. Division makes us weak in the face of our political opponents that still hide in the shadows."
 
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies:0 "Clear Military Hierachies"
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies_desc:0 "One of the most pressing issues for us is the loyalty of the army – Loudbark seems to have infiltrated the army rather successfully. We should ask in Griffenheim for some army advisors, which would bolster our command structure and coincidentally also make it secured against a future takeover attempt."
 
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB:0 "Outlaw The SPB"
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB_desc:0 "This farce has been going on for long enough. We have tried to handle the socialist movement by making some reforms while banning their more dangerous ideas, yet it has not come to fruition. Now, we will make the hammer come down and outright ban the Socialist Party."
 
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages:0 "Spread Loyalist Messages"
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages_desc:0 "Every dog should know that what we aspire to is to help and support the emperor. This is the least common denominator for every dog in Bronzehill, and we will base our propaganda efforts on it. The idea of a Bronzehill-led regency is just crazy-talk by dangerous people."
 
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim:0 "Invite Advisors From Griffenheim"
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim_desc:0 "Bronzehill's industry is still lacking, and the ongoing political crisis has shaken our administration as well. What could be more natural to ask our overlord to help us out? Griffon advisors will make everything easier, while also helping to control any lingering unrest."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist_desc:0 "The crisis is over, finally. The Bronzehill Council has been a thorn in our side instead of being helpful, but now we have gathered enough political strength to send them home. Boreas bless them, and farewell."
 
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity:0 "A True Show Of Unity"
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council was originally intendent to show the united support of the dogs for the emperor. This worked rather mediocre, to be polite. However, with the political crisis over, we are finally ready to unite behind the emperor and his regent. Our bond will never be broken."
 
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs:0 "Most Loyal And Faithful Dogs"
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs_desc:0 "The newfound unity of the dogs will also make itself known in the army. If we fight, we fight for the emperor, and we will fight proudly under his flag."
 
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim:0 "Reinvigorate Trade With Griffenheim"
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim_desc:0 "Despite our strong bonds, the economic relation with Griffenheim has been lacking lately, mostly due to their own economic troubles. But with the empire slowly getting back on track, our trade relationship should deepen again. If we do it right, Bronzehill's economy will gain a good boost out of this."
 
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park:0 "The Grover V Memorial Park"
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park_desc:0 "Grover V was truly a great emperor. A grand park in Bronzekreuz will be constructed to honour and remember him. This will both serve as a nice addition to our city, being a place to relax and enjoy, and also as a reminder for all dogs that we are the most loyal subjects of his majesty."
 
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire:0 "The Forge Of The Empire"
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire_desc:0 "In the old times, before it all came crashing down in the revolution, Bronzehill was known as the "Forge of the Empire". We dogs are well versed in how to extract and refine the treasures of the earth, be it metals or gems. While we might have a long way to go before our old glory can be reclaimed, we will make our efforts known."

 BRZ_barking_suns_coup_desc:0 "With the Bronzehill Council in deadlock, Barking-Sun has finally made his move and overthrown the government with the help of his loyal mining dogs. The Count has fled, but resistance to our rule remains. Our great task begins here."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_army:0 "Secure The Army"
 BRZ_secure_the_army_desc:0 "The Army is the institution most hostile to our new government. But when Barking-Sun can appeal to the mining dogs, he can also sway the common soldier. As for the commanders... we need to destroy the old command structure of the army as quickly as possible, to secure a future for our regime."
 
 BRZ_target_the_national_union:0 "Target The National Union"
 BRZ_target_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is our greatest political enemy. Now that we have taken control of Bronzekreuz, we can finally move to destroy them once and for all. Down with the reaction!"
 
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp:0 "Disband The HKP"
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp_desc:0 "The Harmonic-Conservative Party is a group of weaklings, pseudo-reformers and double-faced reactionaries. Their claims of peace and liberty are lies to deceive the working class, for they want to keep the old oppressors in their lofty positions. Our revolution has made them terrified, and rightfully so: They are the next to go."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge The Nobles"
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have already seen from where the wind is blowing and have abandoned their estates. However, others are fighting in the shadows or openly defy our rule. Here, any temperance would be our downfall, we have to strike fast and hard."
 
 BRZ_hunt_the_count:0 "Hunt The Count"
 BRZ_hunt_the_count_desc:0 "Ignatius, the old Count of Bronzehill, has fled the capital as our revolution broke out. His whereabouts is currently unknown, an unacceptable security risk for our government. We will start a great hunt to either force him to flee our borders or, even better, to have him executed."
 
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy:0 "Mobilize The Economy"
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy_desc:0 "We have the high goal of marching on Griffenheim and saving Grover VI from his ill advisors and deceptive nobles. However, for that we need guns, cannons and other war material. We will have to fully mobilize the economy of Bronzehill and Barking-Sun has just the right ideas on how to do it."
 
 BRZ_liberation_corps:0 "Liberation Corps"
 BRZ_liberation_corps_desc:0 "The ''Befreiungskorps'' (Liberation Corps) are special units staffed with only the most loyal supporters of Barking-Sun, mostly his old comrades from the mines. They will be essential for conquering Griffenheim. May they live up to their name!"
 
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication:0 "Principle Of Total Dedication"
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication_desc:0 "The Principle of total dedication is quite simple: Everything for the emperor. We work, fight and die for him. There can no thought but his liberation on our minds. This is our duty, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_industrial_independence:0 "Industrial Independence"
 BRZ_industrial_independence_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill is still entangled in trade with Griffenheim and other parts of Herzland. With nothing but traitors to the emperor surrounding us, we cannot accept this, but we need to work extra hard to ensure our industrial independence."
 
 BRZ_new_academia:0 "New Academia"
 BRZ_new_academia_desc:0 "The academic system of Bronzehill needs a total makeover. We need to focus our research efforts on the things that matter to us, namely how to best defeat the false regent in Griffenheim. Otherwise, we need to cull research that is not on our political line."
 
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy:0 "Barking-Sun's Philosophy"
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy_desc:0 "Barking-Sun is not much of an academic writer, but he surely has a clear view of the world. With the help of some academic that have proven their loyalty, Barking-Sun will publish a book for every good dog to carry around. As it is printed with a red cover, it will soon enough be known as the ''little red book''."
 
 # Luxembark path
 
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate:0 "The Outsider Candidate"
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate_desc:0 "To the surprise of everyone, Rosey Luxembark has won the race for chancellorship. The more established political parties are still in utter confusion how she got here, but our new government has a clear task: To reform Bronzehill so that the workingdogs can finally take their fair share."
 
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs:0 "A Government For The Workingdogs"
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs_desc:0 "The SPB always was the true defender of working rights in Bronzehill. We have stood up for the common dog when others hid behind promises of reform or populist lies. Now that we have the strings of power in our paws, we can truly bring forth a government for the workingdogs."
 
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles:0 "Curtail The Nobles"
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have reacted with concern to Luxembark's chancellorship, with some even calling for openly resisting her rule. With cannot stand. While we don't intend to abolish their titles, we need to curtail their political power so that they can no longer threaten our plans to reforge the economy."
 
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws:0 "Reverse The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "For a long time, the operations of the SPB and the socialist movement were hamstringed by a series of laws dubbed the ''socialist laws'', which outlawed our organizations and writings. However, with this, the reactionaries have set a legal precedent, which we can now turn on its head. From now on, reactionary propaganda is banned in Bronzehill."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union:0 "Purge The National Union"
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is a collection of militarists, reactionaries and imperialists, in short, the anti-thesis to our government. And of course, their chairdog Rufus Loudbark has tried to turn the army against our government ever since it came to be. But with the new anti-reactionary laws at paw, we can finally shatter their movement."
 
 BRZ_replace_the_count:0 "Replace The Count"
 BRZ_replace_the_count_desc:0 "Until now, Count Ignatius has accepted our government, if only barely. However, there can be little doubt that he intends to overthrow our government as soon as he gets the opportunity. While Rosey Luxembark does not intend to abolish the monarchy, we could just force Ignatius to abdicate in favour of Barnaby, who is much less of a threat to our government."
 
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils:0 "Introduce Worker Councils"
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils_desc:0 "One of the key program points is the establishment of worker councils, which would serve as a democratic root for the socialist party. However, let us not put our hind paws in the front. For now, the worker councils will not directly take over the economy, but serve as counsel for the factory workers."
 
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs:0 "Expropriate The Oligarchs"
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs_desc:0 "The businessgriffs from Herzland, but also various domestic nobles and businessdogs have formed an oligarchical power structure that controls Bronzhill's economy.

 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog:0 "March Of The Working Dog"
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog_desc:0 "The ''March of the Workingdogs'' is a famous political song from Bronzehill, adapted by us as the new anthem. United we stand, for the common good. Singing this song, we will march on Griffenheim and bring forth a new era of socialist cooperation and workers democracy."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry:0 "Sway The Peasantry"
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The agrarian population of Bronzehill is large and consists of many destitute dogs and griffons. Yet, they have not heart our call and stayed apathetic to our government's reforms. We have to go on the offensive and listen to their issues, so that the every dog can stand united."
 
 BRZ_worker_self_organization:0 "Worker Self-Organization"
 BRZ_worker_self_organization_desc:0 "First results from the expropriation of nobles are in, and the results are astounding. It is clear that factories work better if the workers can decide themselves how to organize. They don't need bosses to shove them around, for they have the most experience of how things really work."
 
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Expand Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "The University of Bronzekreuz is still young, but it is expanding rapidly. Bronzehill needs new talent; it needs researchers, engineers, teachers and other professionals to be able to stand up to Griffenheim. We will put in another massive expansion round for the university, to hopefully attract new talent from back home and abroad."
 
 # Barnaby path
 
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby:0 "Give Power To Barnaby"
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby_desc:0 "With Copperhill's ascendance to chancellorship, our country is now on the track of democratic and harmonic reform. Given Barnaby's close relationship with him in the past, it is best for our nation if Ignatius would step down and pass the crown to the crown prince, something that he has agreed to do."
 
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists:0 "Negotiate With The Socialists"
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists_desc:0 "The radicals from the SPB have expressed their discontent with our reform agenda and agitate against us with their radical slogans. However, the SPB also has a rather large faction of moderates, which could be won over if we prove ourselves as genuine reformers. We will listen to their demands,  as when they switch sides, the rest of the SPB will sink into irrelevance."
 
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws:0 "Labour Reform Laws"
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws_desc:0 "Our promises to the progressives and moderate socialists should not stay empty, or otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble once more. But our labour reforms are not socialist in nature, but aim to create a more just, equal and harmonious society."
 
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda:0 "Start The Reform Agenda"
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda_desc:0 "The list of problems in Bronzehill is long, and so is the list our planned reforms. With Barnaby and Copperhill at the helm, we can finally make our dreams of a better Bronzehill into a reality. Our first step is to formalize our rule by creating a cabinet with clear administrative responsibilities."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles:0 "Sway The Nobles"
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have looked with concern on all of our promises, as they fear that we will come after their privileges. And this is true, to some extent. Yet, we have to make it clear to them that this is the best they can hope for anyways. In this modernizing world, a society build purely on nobles is weak, as proven by the revolution of 978."
 
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union:0 "Undermine The National Union"
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union_desc:0 "The last place we have to bring to our side is the army. Loudbark has a tight grip on the soldiers, but our reform agenda will improve their lives too. We will go to the barracks to tell and listen, so that hopefully they will abandon their radicalism for our harmony."
 
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Deal With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "There is no way of putting it mildly: These businessgriffs, whether from Griffenheim or somewhere else in Herzland, are a stain on Bronzehill's economy and we need to do something about them. Although large-scale nationalizations run against our party principles in general, in this case there is simply no way around it."
 
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections:0 "New City Council Elections"
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections_desc:0 "Until now, the city councils were elected under a census suffrage system, where only middle and upper class residents could vote. However, we have now abandoned this system in favour of a true universal suffrage, and it is time to put this new law into practice. New city council elections will be held, open to everyone."
 
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice:0 "Our Cause For Justice"
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice_desc:0 "When we march against Griffenheim, it is not out of treason to the empire, no, it is rather in the desire to bring true justice, harmony and equality to the empire as a whole. Grover needs a good regent, who can reform the empire, not selfish nobles or lunatic theocrats."
 
 BRZ_domestic_investments:0 "Domestic Investments"

 BRZ_the_nationalization_act:0 "The Nationalization Act"
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act_desc:0 "The assets of the various Herzland companies in Bronzehill are nothing short of foreign meddling in our affairs.

 # General Events
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger In The Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."
 bronzehill.1.a:0 "No, please no. Please..."

 bronzehill.2.t:0 "The Flower Gems"
 bronzehill.2.d:0 "It is a Diamond Dog tradition, that in the event of a death, the family and friends of the deceased are expected to gather a bouquet of precious stones known as flower gems. These stunning rocks are then crafted into a beautiful display which adorns the deceased's grave and acts as a reminder of how much they were loved and cherished.\n\nIn the wake of Grover's death, the dogs of Bronzehill have begun a migration to the capital. Each of them depositing their own collection of gems at the count's palace. Within a day this collection was impressive, within a week it was majestic, now it's overwhelming.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has commissioned the greatest artisans of the county to work together and manufacture these gems into a grand display of our dogs' devotion to the emperor.

However, for now the dogs and griffons of Ravensburg celebrated the opening with large fair. Under pompous fanfare, Count Ignatius cut the red band and ceremoniously gave the signal to start operations.\n\nThe next days, the news all over the country reported about the event. Woofrey Pawner was standing in front of a kiosk and read through the headlines: "Industrial Park operational! Huge Progress for Ravensburg!" (Bronzekreuzer Bote) - "Ravensburg's Industrial Park at work! New opportunities available" (Bronzehügeler Wirtschaftswoche) - "Raven dam opened! How will this affect Bronzehill?" (Harmonisches Morgenblatt) - "New Industries in Ravensburg - but all from Griffenheim" (Nationaler Beobachter) - "Count Ignatius' newest scheme in operation. But will it help him?" (Der Arbeiter). He shook his head. How could they all have so different opinions on the matter? He decided that these scribblers weren't worth this money and moved on.\n\nFar away, in an office in Griffenheim, several griffons toasted on the new project. They hadn't found it necessary to personally travel to Bronzehill, but they surely loved the thought about how many idols would flow into their deep pockets."

The Crown Prince fixated his father with his eyes, his anger and disappointment clearly visible. "Bronzehill is becoming more and more a colony of these businessgriffs! Do you really think that the people will not notice? All the major parties condemned how the Grover V Industrial Park was organized, and here you are doing more of the same?"\n\nIgnatius let out a sigh. "My dear son and crown prince, even you are not allowed to burst into my office and yell at me. If I do something, I usually have a good reason for it. But I see from your look that perhaps you haven't gotten it." Ignatius pointed to a chair in front of the desk. "So, please, sit down and listen. You will eventually come to rule this country, and so I should indeed explain this to you. Bronzehill's economy isn't doing well. You perhaps do not know the old prosperity, in the times of before the revolution tore everything asunder. Back then, Bronzehill was the blast furnace of the empire, with the forges of the dogs delivering the finest metals to every corner of it. The Bronzehillian economy was in excellent shape, one of the best of in these times. Then came the revolution, and everything fell apart. But these companies are interested in Bronzehill's ores. They want Bronzehill to once more become the forge of the empire, or what is left of it. We desperately need these investments.

But his new job as teacher here in the peaks payed quite well, so at least he would be able to afford a nice vacation once it was over.\n\nWhatever he had expected of the village, it was worse than he imagined. How could these dogs live in their caves without sunlight for so long? And these houses... they truly were more shacks than proper homes. The major lead him to the newly build schoolhouse. At least this looked a bit more comfortable.\n\nThe next morning, the major invited him to an official announcement that the school would open. Many dogs looked at him confused or scared. He could imagine that they had never seen a griffon before. The ceremony was in Dogish. Victor could follow along, as he was one of the few people from the south of Bronzehill who had learned it properly, yet the strong accent proved difficult even for him. After the major's speech, he passed the word to the new teacher.\n\nVictor sweated dearly, as he tried to not make mistakes in his Dogish. "Dear dogs of Barazgund. Many of you probably did not expect your new teacher to be a griffon. But make no mistake! I'm from Bronzehill as much as you are, and my family has lived near Hundsfeld for generations. I've come to teach your cubs to read and write and calculate, skills that I believe are worthy to learn for everycreature. My lectures will be in Dogish, but the reading and writing will be in Herzlander. Don't worry, I will try my best to integrate into your way of life.

 bronzehill_imperialindustrial.1.d:0 "Mara Rosefur slowly walked towards her office, afraid of what she would find today. Since Bronzehill had taken Griffenheim and [BRZ.GetLeader] had been proclaimed Imperial regent, her work had been a total mess. Many griffons around her had either died during the fighting or had been fired by the dogs for having supported the previous regent, leaving her with an impossible workload. She also had gotten a new boss, a diamond dog from Bronzekreuz, but Johanna Whitetail seemed just as overwhelmed as herself.\n\nIn the last weeks, she and her boss had made for a rather comical pair. Johanna seemed to know nothing about how things worked here in Griffenheim, and apparently had only been a minor bureaucrat in the dogs' bureaucracy. Now she was supposed to oversee the department for economic development, quite the serious promotion. In theory, this department would have over a hundred griffs working in it, but Mara was the only one left. The grant requests stacked up to the ceiling, and sooner rather than later the whole office would be taken up by unaddressed paperwork.\n\nDespite these hurdles, she liked her new boss. Her old griffon boss had always been loud and demanding, while Johanna seemed much more understanding and attentive. As she opened the door, she saw her smile across the muzzle. "Hello Mara, finally some good news! Five new griffons were sent to me to work here." Mara noticed the griffons standing behind her boss. "And I've been promised that we will get many more colleagues in the near future. Could you take them for a tour of the office?"\n\nAn hour later, Johanna visited her in her office. "When the new clerks come in, do you want to be my personal assistant? I'm still not entirely up to speed on all the matters here, and we have worked so well together for the last weeks. I could also organize a pay raise for you, for sure." Mara slowly nodded."

She was now the personal assistant to the head of department Johanna Whitetail. Together they oversaw more than hundred officials, and the number was increasing.\n\nAs she came out of the office again, she saw Johanna waving a paw. "Mara, how nice! Our new offices are truly magnificent, aren't they? But things get even better. I've gotten info, from the very top." She was now standing beside Mara, and her voice reduced to a whisper. "Our department is set to grow even larger, you know? There are rumours that we will be tasked with improving the economy on a larger scale."\n\nMara looked into her face. Johanna seemed very excited, her eyes glowing in anticipation. For a moment, Mara was reminded of her old boss, a loud, rude griffon obsessed with power. But at a closer look, Johanna was different. This was not power hunger, this was just joy. \n\n"We will probably get even more people working here. I'm therefore looking for potential head of sections. You are at the top of my list. I think we two make a good team, and you have proven that you have an excellent understanding of administrative matters. How does this sound?""

Last evening she had tasted coffee from Abyssinia for the first time. Unbelievably expensive – but her new salary allowed her such things. After shifting through some more paperwork – luckily she had gotten quite good at grasping things at first glance – she had a meeting with Johanna Whitetail, her boss.\n\n"Mara! Good that you're here. I have some big news for you. We will be responsible for the new economic development plan – the 'Imperial Economic Development Initiative', as it's now officially called. I have already plenty of ideas for that. Isn't this great?"\n\n"Hey, congratulations." Mara paused for a little bit, unsure what to answer. "I guess that we should start to make plans on what to do? I can prepare an overview of economically underdeveloped regions of the Empire, or of goods that are in high demand."\n\n"Yeah, you're always at work. And I appreciate it, too.

It was an underground room in the castle, only dimly lit by the chandaliers on the ceiling.\n\n"Barnaby, my son, as you are probably aware, I have decided to call the Bronzehill council. The crisis that has overtaken Griffenheim has severely impacted us as well. Our nation mournes, as do we, therefore it is neccessary to show unity." Barnaby wagged his tail in approval. "But this is not enough. I have also decided that you, my prince, should get the chairdogship in the council. It is only good if the people see you take responsibility, and I think, you are ready for it."\n\n"I see what you mean. At your will, I will lead the council and look for that the council has only the best interest of Bronzehill in mind. Have you decided yet whom to invite?"\n\nA servant brought in a plate of meatballs. Ignatius and Barnaby ate silently for a while, before Ignatius answered:"

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.d:0 "Ignatius decided that he should meet with Winston Copperhill. Though he did not share his son's enthusiasm for the veteran, or Copperhill's distaste for Griffenheim businessgriffs, his career record and accomplishments were not easily disregarded. Thus they sat together at one of the Bronzekreuz clubs, far from anydog's curious ears, sharing a plate of ham and strong Hindian tea between them. "How glad I am you found time for me, Copperhill. How are the pups doing?"\n\n"You haven't invited me here to discuss our children, nor for old war stories, Ignatius. Clearly there is something of greater importance going on, and since I am a busy dog, we should get to it at once." As usual, Winston had little appreciation for decorum, small talk, and wasting time, which the Count could certainly appreciate.\n\n"Very well then. Obviously you heard of it by now — the Emperor has passed away, just as we believed he was about to recover." It still tugged at the heartstrings. "You know what happened last time, you were there and seen it all for yourself. We owe our freedom to griffons, and we'll do anything to keep it that way. To pre-empt any sort of potential instability, I have decided to convene the Bronzehill Council, and you should be present there, as well as perhaps some of your followers." Copperhill was hardly a firebrand, but some in his clique would be more difficult to deal with.\n\nCopperhill kept his expression deliberately impassive, taking a considerable time with the tea. At last, he spoke: "You'll understand if I do not turn out to be your enthusiastic supporter, but I'll gladly accept your invitation. The Emperor's passage has been a... difficult time for everydog, but we cannot mourn forever. This is a great opportunity to enact some positive changes not just for Bronzehill, but for the Empire at wide." Surprisingly optimistic for the old dog, but he wasn't willing to acquiesce just yet. After some further discussion, Copperhill had given the Count some names to consider. Ignatius did not mention that Barnaby would be the chairdog, and since Copperhill had not mentioned it either, chances were good he already knew."

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.t:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.d:0 "Bronzekreuz Castle may not have been the biggest castle, but it surely had its fair share of secrets. Barnaby had spent much of his youth exploring the secret rooms you could find in the underground parts of the castle, and now it came in useful for a quite serious purpose. He had invited a usual guest into the castle, and they both had agreed that their conversation should better remain private. And so, in one of the hidden meeting rooms, Barnaby and Rosey Luxembark sat on old chairs around an even older table.\n\nRosey Luxembark decided to open. "I honestly have to say, this invitation was something I did not expect. And I guess your father would also not expect it?" Barnaby gave a slow nod. "He doesn't exactly have the best opinion on the SPB, I would say." She let out a chuckle.\n\n"He has not, indeed. But this is more important than just his opinion. The workers deserve representation."\n\n"For a price, I assume?"\n\n"To respect the Council would already be quite a good price, I think." Barnaby sighed. "But this is indeed not all. As you can probably imagine, Loudbark will be on the council as well. He and his militarists are a clear danger to our Bronzehill."\n\nLuxembark took a while to answer, weighing her option. "I can help with that, indeed." She let out another chuckle. "I guess it will be quite the shock for the Count when you present him this idea. Anyways, let me give you some names of people you can trust." She fumbled in her briefcase. "Woofkin, yes, Liebarknecht, as well. Not Barking-Sun. Maybe Tählpoodles?" Her words got lost while she was scribbling all over a sheet of paper.\n\nTwo hours later, Barnaby had good knowledge of most upper SPB party members. Luxembark had told some jokes of inside the party, almost forgetting whom she was speaking to. But their plan was clear - now it was on the Crown Prince to convince his father."

Thus the gruff soldier led Ignatius to a nearby bunker, which was positively austere compared to his usual surroundings, but he wasn't going to complain about it. He would have raised a word about his deputy's presence, but Loudbark reassured the Count that Lassie would keep things confidential.\n\nHuddled together in a small room, Loudbark wasted little time with his usual diatribe. "I was most surprised, quite so, when I learned you wished to meet with me, my Count. Have you finally seen the folly of your ways? Have the Griffenheim vultures filched enough marrow from common dogs' bones? Grover is dead, and you know what will happen next. Unrest and insecurity, and poor Bronzehill stuck in the middle of it, with few options for itself." The deputy nodded enthusiastically to everything he said like an excited pup.\n\nIgnatius, however, had to resist the urge to smack himself in the face with both paws. "That's quite enough, Rufus. While your rhetoric might work on somedog more simpleminded, I've been singlepawedly keeping the terms of our agreement with the griffons as fair as they possibly can be." Not to say that they weren't demanding at times. "But you are right about the other thing. There must not be a repeat of 978, and to that end I think the National Union deserves a fair representation in the Bronzehill Council. We might not agree on everything, but especially now everydog must stand together."\n\nHe could almost see the gears turning in Loudbark's head. Accept and gain some actual influence in decision making, or refuse to play the eternal populist complaining from the sides? It didn't take very long. "You can't blame me for trying.

Kimball Barking-Sun looked at his old home, here in the village he was born in. Kaza-Narag was not a special village, just one of many coal mining villages in the upper mountains of Bronzehill. Once a week large trucks arrived to carry away the coal mined, in exchange for food and other necessities. But they were never generous. How was this not slavery? Had they even escaped the mountain tyrant, the slaver of Diamond Mountain, or had they just exchanged his rule for that of his minions?\n\nBut Barking-Sun was not here for nostalgia. No, pressing issues were on the agenda. An opportunity how it could only ever happen once a century had opened. From his spies, he had learned of the meeting between Luxembark and the crown prince, with some juicy information about her opinions on other party members. If Ignatius would dismiss Barnaby's proposal - which he would do, as minion of the mountain tyrant - he would finally find his opening to oust her as chairdog of the SPB and wrangle control of the party for himself. And then, the real task begun. Finally, the old wrong could be corrected, the misfortune of Grover II overcome. And if everything would go according to his plan, the rule of the mountain tyrant could finally be ended for good, four Grovers later than it should have been.\n\nBut for all these lofty plans, he needed the support of the mining dogs. They knew him, and they trusted him. He had worked for years here, besides them, and he knew what steered them. Things would need to start moving, for if this change was missed, how long would it be before another one would present itself?"

And the Crown Prince is even worse."\n\n"Ignatius is a good person, but his faith is weak. He doesn't trust the Archonate as much as he should. Have I not told him long ago that these socialists needed to be dealt with properly?" She clapped her beak in disappointment.

Before them was a long list, the collection of potential councillors. While the Count reserved himself the right to make the final call, he wanted to see what priorities his son would set, and so they vividly discussed each of the candidates. Most of the nobles on the list were set; they were too indispensable and pass over them would just be a political faux pass. Yet, with the political figures on the list, the choices weren't so clear. Both Copperhill and Loudbark had provided a number of candidates that they claimed to deserve a seat, but some of these names would need to be cut to not give the politicians to much power in the council.\n\nAs they argued, Barnaby also had a different thought in mind. It seemed almost inevitable that both the HKP and the NU would end up with the same number of councillors, just to save political face. And here he would need to argue to his father, as he knew that Ignatius was also weary of Loudbark.\n\n"I want to bring a different idea on the table. I know that we are both concerned that Loudbark could sway the council into making decisions that... would be unpleasant to work with. But what if we brought in another candidate? Like Luxembark?" The Count's ears pinned back upon hearing that name, but he didn't say anything. "Including her and maybe one or two of her friends would make controlling Loudbark easier. And it would also serve as a much needed guesture to the working dogs of Bronzehill, that we have not forgotten they exist."\n\nBarnaby tried his best to tempt Ignatius to consider the idea, but his father just fixated him with his eyes. After a while, Barnaby ran out of ideas of what to tell, and so they remained silent for a minute. He knew that the answer would be the final one."

The constant party discussion had just gone on her nerves recently.\n\n"It has come to my knowledge that our chairdog, Comrade Luxembark, has had a meeting with Crown Prince Barnaby.", Barking-Sun opened. "During this meeting, she apparently felt confident to tell the young prince a variety of things. My informant has given me a list of remarks that she made with regards to our much valued comrades." He led out a smirk. "But this is not all. Furthermore, I was informed that Prince Barnaby had offered her a place in the Bronzehill Council, for the price that she would order us to stop distributing 'inflammatory material'. I would like to ask you all, is that the behaviour of a good chairdog? Is that what loyalty to our movement looks like?"\n\nThe meeting went on for a bit.

However, in the end, she saw no other chance then to call a leadership vote, otherwise the party would never unite behind her anymore. As could be expected, her rival decided to challenge her in that vote.\n\nAnd with a margin of 7-5 votes, the party leadership board voted in favour of Barking-Sun.

But there is no other way now."\n\nWhile the Crown Prince looked miserable, he still tried to give an answer. "My father, I respect your decision. You are the Count. But I want to say at least that the forces I ostensibly unleashed were already there. Many of our institutions are weary of how our relationship with Griffenheim works. And who tells us that it will not end in another catastrophe?"\n\n"I can tell you, it will not. The Griffenheim court is different from how it was 50 years ago. They will figure something out. Our place is to serve the emperor, not trying to overthrow is regent in a useless endeavour."\n\nThe next day, Count Ignatius gave a statement to the Bronzehill Council. It was rather short, informing the council that the last vote would be overturned by the Count's veto. The reactions were, as expected, quite hostile. They would be needed to be dealt with."

As nothing seemed to move forward, Count Ignatius had already tinkered on the idea of disbanding the council and throwing his support behind the regent in Griffenheim. However, now the Council gathered together and finally ended the deadlock. The chair of the council, Crown Prince Barnaby, announced a vote on who should be recommended to Count Ignatius to serve as "Chancellor" of the nation, a new position that would serve as head of government.

Early in the morning, a well-organized attack on Bronzekreuz cut the city from the communication lines. Simultaneously, subversive elements in the army derailed an early response plan, while all across the country the mining dogs formed militias to patrol the streets.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the Bronzetail family was tipped off and had decided to spend the days in the summer residence near Bellen. While their estate was quickly assaulted and taken, the Count and his family had already fled into the woods.\n\nAt ten o'clock, a radio message from Barking-Sun could be heard on all channels. "Dogs of Bronzehill! I am speaking to you from Bronzekreuz to tell you that our comrades from the SPB have taken over the government. While the reaction will try to dislodge this act of revolution, we will stand our ground and fight. And then, we will march on Griffenheim to free Grover from those who wish to harm him, so he may lead us to freedom like Grover II once did.""

Of course, quite a few councillors were invited from such an influential institution. Some of them had party loyalties to follow, but a surprising number of these councillors were not aligned to a party, or if they were, interpreted their party membership quite liberal. As such, a natural question arose: Who would get the support from most of them?"

It was quite clear that any upheaval to the Bronzehill political landscape could only come at their expense, and so the nobles were naturally closer to Ignatius position. However, the vote passed, and slowly but surely most nobles have realized that the future of Bronzehill would lie in the paws of the parties, not the Bronzekreuz court. With fears about socialism on the rise, both Copperhill and Loudbark have positioned themselves to offer an alternative."

Like many youth movements, these actions have a left-leaning political tone, supporting the SPB, however not entirely.  As most of the students come from well-off families, a number of them also tend to support the more mild approach of reform from the HKP.

 bronzehill_loyalist.1.t:0 "A Trip to Readewetter"
 bronzehill_loyalist.1.d:0 "Sitting in his chair in Bronzekreuz castle, Ignatius tried to recapitulate the last few days. All in all, his visit of Gabriela had been quite successful. Upon arriving in Readewetter, was honoured by the Strawberry guards and welcomed by the Countess herself. At the first evening, Gabriela had organized a small ball in his honour. Under the dulcet sounds of the Strawberrian court orchestra, he danced with various noble ladies from the duchy.\n\nThinking about the ball brought his mind to Barnaby. Despite his insistence, his son had excused himself from accompanying him on this trip. How much more would have Barnaby needed this ball! He was 23 now and still unmarried. At this age Ignatius had already had two pups... would he even see his grandpups?\n\nCutting off this rather unpleasant train of thought, he focused again on his trip to Strawberry. The next day, Gabriela and he had the conversation that he had wanted to have. Bronzehill would support her in her effort to wrangle the regency from Eros, and in the meantime the two countries would work closely together to make the most of their combined efforts. Over the next days, he had already made some contacts with Strawberrian investors, who had shown quite the interest of taking over shares of Griffenheim companies.\n\nHis thoughts began to wander again. He liked Gabriela, he really did. She had the right ideas. Eros was so... populist and extreme at times, always coated in religious phrasing. Nonsense. All nonsense. Gabriela would do a much better job, surely."

The dogs of Bronzehill would support her in her endeavour to fight Eros for the regency, and all they demanded in return was some industrial cooperation now and that she would strengthen the position of the nobility in the empire. It was quite nice to hear that Ignatius agreed with her on Eros – the old griff might have outmanoeuvred her in Griffenheim, but she would let not stand."

While this was announced only as an event for industrial cooperation and a "meeting between friends", our spies confirmed that they both have indeed agreed upon a military pact: Should Gabriela attack us, the dogs would join her.

 bronzehill_loyalist.7.t:0 "Boreas' Will"
 bronzehill_loyalist.7.d:0 "Ignatius was wandering around in Griffenheim. The city had been devastated by the war, but the fighting had stopped before the soldiers had reached the Imperial Palace or the Temple of Boreas. And the last one was his goal right now.\n\nHe had never been an overly religious dog. The Trinity was watching over griffons and dogs alike, but their supposed servants would rather meddle in politics instead of providing for their parishioners. Archon Eros had laid claim to the regency and tried to turn the whole empire into being subservient to the temples. But he was gone now...\n\nAnd other questions had arisen instead. It had been Bronzehill's army, his loyal dogs, who had taken the centre of the empire. It was now him who could wander through the city, while his soldiers patrolled the streets. This had truly been an unexpected turn of events – who would have thought that small, poor Bronzehill would have been the one to break through the final defence of the Reichsarmee?\n\nThere must have been some reason for that, Ignatius thought. Arcturius had guided the dogs through their battles, and he had favoured them over the griffons. But Boreas, the highest of the trinity, must have told Arcturius to lead the dogs the way. Here, in his temple, now devoid its priest, he would come to an answer.\n\nThis was his question now. Had Boreas told him that the dogs, that he would be the better regent? Or had he just gave the dogs the strength to save the emperor, as the griffons would have failed? He would need to decide, and decide soon."

The dogs have transferred all territory outside Bronzehill to us and formally declared their loyalty."

 bronzehill_loyalist.9.t:0 "Bronzehill's Betrayal"
 bronzehill_loyalist.9.d:0 "The Archon was defeated. What should have been our triumph became our embarrassment has the dogs have taken Griffenheim before us. According to the agreements between Gabriela and Ignatius, the dogs should now transfer Griffenheim to us, together with the regency. But it seems that Bronzehill has now taken a different turn... quite a different turn indeed. Count Ignatius has decided to claim the regency for himself, and now demands our subjugation!

 bronzehill_loyalist.11.a:0 "She will be welcome here."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.12.t:0 "Another Meeting"
 bronzehill_loyalist.12.d:0 "How things could change, thought Gabriela. Who could have seen this coming? That Ignatius of all people would betray her? He was still a good conversationalist, but she could not help but feel uncomfortable in his presence. Who would have known that he could be so assertive?\n\nYesterday, she had taken the train from Readewetter to Griffenheim. She had to admit, Ignatius had welcomed her warmly, but she was unsure if this made things better or worse. But then, then... she could visit Grover. Her sweet, sweet nephew, how dearly she had missed him. He was so smart. And he had grown quite a bit since she had seen him last.\n\n'Hello Auntie', Grover had said, 'how nice that you are also here. Ignatius has said that he will be my regent, but that you will advise him and me. That's good, right? I like him, but he is very formal.'\n\nShe sighed. It was right that she had submitted to Ignatius. She wouldn't lead the empire, true, but in the end, Grover was all that mattered, right?"
 bronzehill_loyalist.12.a:0 "Ignatius might do a good job after all."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.13.t:0 "Visiting Gunhild"
 bronzehill_loyalist.13.d:0 ""How nice that you have found the way to me, my Lord. I offer you Boreas' blessing, for that your rule may strengthen the faithful and shatter the godless. My acolyte will serve the dinner soon. Do you wish to join me in prayer to Boreas, who sanctions our rule? I invite you to honour the Trinity, for that the Gods find pleasure in our work."\n\nCould she never let go of her unctuous drivel, Ignatius thought. It was already beginning to annoy him again. But he kept up the play and answered in a measured tone: "Prelate Gunhild, I am also most glad to meet you again. I cannot visit your temple as often as I wish," – what a blatant lie, he thought – "but in times like these I am all the more pleased when I can find the opportunity. For the good of Bronzehill, we need to stand together and overcome what divides us."\n\nA little while later, Gunhild and he were sitting at a lavishly laid table. He had to admit, she was not frugal, maybe she even wished to impress him. During the meal, they only made light conversation, but as they got to the dessert, he decided it was time to come to the topic of this meeting.\n\n"As you know, the socialists are spreading lies and unrest to wherever they go. It should be our common goal to stop their efforts, so that the governance of the country is not disturbed. Therefore, I would like to ask you if you would be willing to join me in a common campaign to counter their agitation."\n\n"My Count, it was a folly to not accept Eros as regent. The temples are the strongest defender against the godless. But this decision has been made, and now we have to do what we must. For that, I will join your efforts, for evil must be fought wherever it arises.""
 bronzehill_loyalist.13.a:0 "I hope that's sorted now."
 
 bronzehill_loyalist.14.t:0 "Finding An Understanding"
 bronzehill_loyalist.14.d:0 "The griffon on the other side of Ignatius' desk looked very much not happy. "These... policies, if enacted, could seriously hurt Bronzehill's economy." Their bottom line. "I understand that the political situation is difficult, but surely it would be better for everycreature if the economy would not experience the same troubles, right? In the name of the Bronzehügeler Industrieverein, I would like to express my deepest concerns."\n\n"It is understandable that some investors might be concerned about the impact of the proposed measures." Ignatius answered. "Yet, I'm afraid, there is no other way. It is more than likely that Bronzehill will need to stand against Griffenheim, even if hopefully not for long. Under these circumstances the current arrangements are simply no longer viable."\n\n"But why should we be so hasty here? Nogriff wants to interfere in the matter of higher politics." They only did this all the time, Ignatius thought. "We from the Industrieverein simply want everydog and everygriff to prosper. I think that we should look over our agreements again." The pain her face was clearly visible. This would cost them many idols either way. "For sure we can figure something out, together."\n\nAfter three hours of intense haggling, the outlines of a new industrial plan for the country took form. It had not been easy, but Bronzehill's economy would be much more independent in the future."

 bronzehill_loyalist.15.d:0 "Tradition.\n\nHow many dogs would feel the same as him upon hearing that word? Probably not too many, Ignatius had to admit. But wasn't it a wonderful thing? Everything in life had a tradition. From humble things like clothing and food, all the way up to the big questions of governance. It gave security, it gave confidence, it gave stability.\n\nBronzehill had gone through trying times, truly, but now things were starting to come back together. The alliance with Strawberry stood strong, the internal forces that tried to tear Bronzehill apart had been contained and the public mood had swung back to his side. How did he do this? By looking at what truly mattered: Tradition.\n\nIgnatius smiled. It was time to prepare for war, but nothing in life could be as worth fighting for as the tradition of the Empire."

 bronzehill_loyalist.16.t:0 "An Envoy From Bronzekreuz"
 bronzehill_loyalist.16.d:0 "Today, an envoy arrived from Bronzekreuz. She brought good news, but also a petition for help.\n\nAfter the death of Grover V, Bronzehill went through a political crisis. Many dogs wanted for Bronzehill to become more autonomous – and they even went so far as to suggest that our government should be overthrown in favour of their own regency. However, being the voice of reason, Count Ignatius has overruled these plans, and with this envoy renews his pledge of loyalty towards the Emperor and our regency.\n\nBut this pledge also comes with a request for help. The political forces that have given the Count so much trouble have not given up yet, and he hopes for our support to suppress the troublemakers. We would be foolish not to send him what little he needs, so we have already send the envoy back, so that she can deliver some funds to our loyal dogs."

 bronzehill_loyalist.17.t:0 "A Parade For Unity"
 bronzehill_loyalist.17.d:0 "The parade came down the street, covered in Imperial flags. The music could be heard from a mile away, as the army orchestra of the Kaisergarde played one triumph march after the other. Griffenheim had sponsored airplanes for the parade, their loud noise being the only thing to overpower the music whenever they dashed over the city, leaving trails in yellow, orange and black.\n\nWoofrey Pawner stood behind the guard rails. The dogs around him where ecstatically waving the troops as they marched. He had to admit, it was hard to not get drawn into the enthusiasm, and so he also waved with the little Imperial flag that police had distributed before the event. Masses were a strange thing, really.\n\nA few hours later, he sat at the table in his house, together with his wife Barkah. She had decided that she didn't want to see the parade, but that didn't mean she wouldn't be curious. "Tell me, how was it? Had they really these flying metal boxes? They didn't crash down, or? I don't trust these things. Griffons can do a lot with their enchantments, but why don't they use their wings, as Eyr intended?" She shook her head.\n\nWoofrey scratched his ear with his hind paw. "Well, yes, they had airplanes. And they seemed to fly very stable. I don't think they rely on magic, though. But they left trails of colour, it was pretty amazing, I have to admit. But they were also loud, very loud. Eh... otherwise, they had music. The orchestra from the Kaisergarde. It was pretty good. Too many marching songs for my taste. But... eh... perhaps fitting for the parade?"\n\n"I still don't know what to make of this. I mean, yes, we should all support the emperor. But don't you think that our Count has become a bit strict lately? I hope that this all cools down again. We dogs serve the emperor, but these businessgriffs, I tell you... I don't like them.""

 bronzehill_loyalist.18.d:0 "It was a quiet day, as if made for this sombre occasion. The opening ceremony for the Grover V Memorial Park was not bombastic, like other celebrations these days, but it was made to honour a late Emperor, and this meant respect and thoughtfulness. Even after this long time, the dogs still mourned.\n\nCount Ignatius opened the ceremony. "Dogs of Bronzehill! This park here is to remind us of a great Emperor, Grover V. His son Grover VI, long may he life, now sits on the golden throne in Griffenheim, where [GRI.GetLeader] acts as his faithful regent. But on this day, we remember the Emperor that has passed on, embraced by Boreas' benign wings. Let us now pray, as Prelate Gunhild prepares the offerings to the Gods, that they may look favourably upon our deeds."\n\nAt his command, the griffoness prepared the offerings. As a number of juicy steaks burned to give to the gods, she spoke the sermon: "Boreas, highest of the gods, hallowed be your name! You gave us intellect, for that we may make wonders for your honour. Eyr, god of the family, hallowed be your name! You gave us bodies, for that we may work in your praise. Arcturius, god of war, hallowed be your name! You gave us strength, for that we may fight for your glory! Gods of the Trinity, look on our work, and give your divine blessing to our monument. This park will hereby be devoted to Grover V, blessed be his name, so we may remember him forever in our heart. Pray, dogs and griffons, who wander through here, for that your hearts may remain pure and loyal, ready to serve the Griffonstone dynasty, now and forever. For that is the will of the gods."\n\nAfter the offerings, the Count gave another speech before the park was finally opened officially. The dogs and griffons spread through the green to look at the various statues of Grover V that adorned the park."

 bronzehill_loyalist.19.t:0 "A Letter Of Reconciliation"
 bronzehill_loyalist.19.d:0 "When a servant brought her a letter from Ignatius, her first impulse was to throw it into the fire. His betrayal still cut deep, and now she was a prisoner in her own palace, far away from her little nephew. She sighted. Was he even remembering her? It had been so long... first Eros, and then Ignatius... but for Eros she had known that he was her enemy, while Ignatius had been a sudden, unprecedented betray. We had a treaty, a Maar-damned treaty, she thought. She sighed.\n\nOf what use would it be to burn his letter, just to sit here doing nothing for all eternity? A useless life! Perhaps it really was better to read it, and to continue then from there. She grabbed the letter with her claw, and cut it open. "To her highness the Duchess of Strawberry." He still used her title, even though she had lost Strawberry.\n\nHalf an hour later, she had reached the end. She took the paper, crumpled it up and threw it into a corner. Why did he know her so well? She sighed again. Yes, she really wanted to see her nephew again, the Emperor. And he had other good arguments as well. The nobility of the Empire was in discredit, and she wanted to prove that the nobles could be better than that. Under a third sigh she went to the crumbled letter, smoothed it out again and crafted an answer.\n\nA few days later, she once more stepped into the Imperial palace. Ignatius welcomed her, but it all felt bitter for her. But a little while later, she could hear a high-pitched voice: "Aunt Gabby! You're here again! Ignatius already told me that you would now be part of the court again." And so she went and embraced her nephew. It was all worth it."

 bronzehill_autonomist.1.d:0 "The news from Bronzehill were troublesome in recent times. After the coup by Kimball Barking-Sun, the former county had taken a radical turn, and the new ruler seemed to purge any institution of the old state.\n\nThe former Count had been forced to flee his residence during the revolution, but so far he had stayed in Bronzehill, in the hopes that loyal elements of the army or bureaucracy would allow for his restauration, or that the Empire would intervene on his behalf. However, now it seems that the Barking-Sun had started a targeted search to dispel the last remnants of monarchist resistance, and if Ignatius didn't want to be captured, he finally had to abandon his old home. His son, Prince Barnaby, had retreated deeper into the mountains together with some loyal followers, but it seemed unlikely that they could risk an open rebellion any time soon.\n\n[THIS.GetLeader] welcomed Ignatius warmly. "My friend, I am sorry for you. While Bronzehill might be ruled by godless revolutionaries for now, there can be little doubt that the Empire shall return one day. I promise you that once this day comes, you will be reinstated in your old titles."\n\n"I am most thankful for your kind words. However, the dogs that I sought to guide and protect have failed me, and I have no aspirations to return to Bronzekreuz. I believe that the lands are better to be ruled by the Emperor directly. For my part, I have no higher wish than to serve the him. Might the other dogs have gone crazy, I know my duty, and I will fulfil it to the best of my ability.""

"Either we strike now or never."\n\nAnother knight took his sword and rammed it into the ground. "This is all so stupid. We are probably sitting in the same cave that they sat before us, and now we prove to be even more coward then they have been. If we do it now, they army might still join us. We have waited too long already."\n\nSurrounded by the knights sat a single, old griffoness. Most would have not associated her with the noble priest that preached the sermon in Ravensburg. Prelate Gunhild had lost some of her feathers, together with most of her eloquent style. "The socialists are the spawn of Maar. We need to squash their heads in for their crimes against the Gods! Trying to arrest me – me, that I'm the representative of Boreas himself. These godless sinners need to go – all of them. If my old friend here" – she looked over to the Grandmaster – "had not warned me in time, only the Gods know what these creatures would have done to me."\n\nFinally, Grandmaster Lucky moved. "You are all maddogs. An attack right now would be suicide. Their government will fail as soon as Griffenheim moves; then we can come out of our caves to serve..." His response was cut off by the alarm bell ringing. "... Oh well, we might as well do our last stand then.""

Seeing the many loyal dogs, ready to serve the Emperor just like he was, filled him with proud. The dogs still had their spirit – together, they would free Grover, who would lead them to true liberty. Inspired by the moment, Barking-Sun stopped. His entourage looked to him in confusion, but he just barked that they should get him a microphone.\n\n"My loyal dogs! The hour approaches. Not for long, and our loyalty will be tested on the battlefield. The reactionaries will throw their griffons against our lines, hoping to stop our advance so that they may keep the Emperor chained forever. But I believe in you. I have heard great things about your training, and I can see on your faces that you are ready to march against the enemy. But don't become complacent! The fight will be hard, long and bloody."\n\nBarking-Sun stopped for a moment, collecting himself. "And now I ask you: Are you ready to fight?" A loud 'Yes' echoed form the soldiers. "Are you ready to sweat and bleed in battle?" Another 'Yes'. "And, if it comes to that, are you ready to give your life for the Emperor?" A third 'Yes' reverberated from the troops.

He can still change his mind."\n\n"The reactionaries always fall because of their internal divisions. The strength of the international workers movement is to use their squabbles to overthrow them."\n\n"Wilhelm, we have all read the theory, thank you." Rosey Luxembark gave him an annoyed look. "And what Clara said is of course true. We might have won for the moment, but we need to tread carefully. Nonetheless, I would agree with Wilhelm that it is sort of poetic to use their own laws against them. To that end, Ernst, have you prepared the lists?" Her minister of justice dropped a stack of papers on the table. "Good. Wilhelm, you are rewriting the curriculum. Clara, you are preparing the new tax codes. There will be backlash.

I can understand why you would find the new government to be unusual for Bronzehill, but these changes where necessary. We are not here to pursue a radical change of course."

 bronzehill_ignatius.1.t:0 "A Curious Inquiry"
 bronzehill_ignatius.1.d:0 "Wagon after wagon of food and drinks arrived at the palace. The number of servants seemingly had increased even more, and all across the palace the rooms looked cleaner than ever. As Grover wandered around his palace, he could see some griffons furiously scrubbing a tapestry depicting Grover II's crusade. As long as he could remember, it had always looked rather dire – possibly due to its location in some far flung wing of the extensive palace – but now the colours were vibrant again as if it was freshly knotted.\n\nThe general business had caught onto him, and he decided to inquire from his regent what this was all about. He found Ignatius in the great hall, where he was busy debating with some strange looking merchants. From what he understood, they debated with Ignatius in Aquileian – Grover had started to learn this language already, but he wasn't good enough yet to follow the conversation. He decided to make himself known by slapping Ignatius' hind paw with his wings.\n\nIgnatius almost made a roll backwards as he noticed his Emperor. "Grover, my Emperor! What brings me the honour of your presence?" Seemingly confused, he looked around. "And may I ask where your nanny... where Johanna is?"\n\nGrover rolled his eyes. "I've left her in my room. But now tell me, what's going on here? Why do the servants clean tapestry in wings nogriff will ever wander? And what is all the food for?"\n\n"Ah yes. I would have told you in due time, but I can also tell you now. There's going to be a grand ball here in Griffenheim, with nobles and other seigneuries invited from all over your Empire. Great, isn't it? We still have to prepare quite a few things – including you getting a new ball dress to show off.""

He had memorized a lot of names, and so far his mind had not betrayed him. But the ball in total would have over 2000 noble families invited – while he would maybe not shakes paws with all of them, here he would need to rely on the help of the palace servants.\n\nBut the first day, and even more so the first evening, had been reserved for the truly high nobility. Ignatius had commissioned a dance suite that would be performed by the palace orchestra. Grover had shown off his new dress – excessively fashionable and expensive, as would be expected from an Emperor. The palace kitchen had presented various delicacies, and Ignatius had seen with a smile that Grover seemed to enjoy the variety in food. Hopefully he didn't demand to get those every day now, as this would be capable of draining an unhealthy amount of state funds.\n\nGrover. Right. Yesterday, the young boy had made a very favourable impression. But it also had gotten quite late, and it showed today. Ignatius had allowed this, because after all, the highest nobility was the most important one, and also Grover seemed to genuinely have fun. But today he would need to be more careful. The ball would go on for three more days, and the Emperor would need to be at least somewhat awake for the closing ceremony.\n\nSnapping out of this short moment of recollection, Ignatius moved to welcome more guests.

It now seemed that they would accept and indeed support him as Imperial regent. He smiled. The Empire would enjoy the stability of noble rule. And eventually, Grover would grow up and Ignatius would retire, but the Empire would continue onwards, with the nobles as a bastion of stability.\n\nBut was it all so easy? Some eerie thoughts creeped into Ignatius head. He started to think about the revolution of 978, and all the misfortune that had led to it. Even though he hated the thought, it seemed undeniable that the noble regency council for poor Grover V had played a part in the events. These nobles had not had the best interested of their subjects at heart.  What a disgrace! Even remembering it was painful for him.\n\nA sudden realization sent a shiver across Ignatius' body. Was he about to make the same mistake? Giving out the power to nobles, and they would just indulge in excesses? Even the possibility of him being the cause of another revolution made him whimper. Never! No, this could not stand.\n\nFor some reason, he always had assumed that all nobles would be like the ones he knew from Bronzehill, modest, temperate and loyal to the Emperor. But as he recalled the ball and examined the nobles' behaviour under this aspect, he realized an uncomfortable truth: For the Empire as a whole, he would need to take precautions..."

But all of them had different costs attached to them, and all of them had different targets and potential results.

Instead, there was greed everywhere, as well as arrogance and cruelty.\n\nHe had to act, or this would cause even greater harm to the Empire at large. These excesses had to stop, and now it was only a matter of finding the methods. He would need to put out some decrees... and for once, they would be decrees that some nobles would strongly disagree with.

On the other side of the table sat a griffon, which was visibly less comfortable than Ignatius. He was the manager of the one of Skyfall's largest banks. Not the owner – by royal decree all business owners who had supported the "false republic" had been expropriated. Their former staff, such like this griffon, now had to wait for orders from the Imperial government on what would be done with the assets.\n\nFor some, the Imperial government would come in the form of the regent himself. After having exchanged a few pleasantries, Ignatius decided to cut straight to the business. "Would you have an estimate of the liquid assets of the bank for me? I guess I should have consulted the books before I met you, but I couldn't find the time." Ignatius showed a smile. Of course he had consulted the books. "Just so that we know what we are dealing with here."\n\n"I have some overview, yes. Of course, the exact numbers are hard to all remember, right?" The griffon tried give a smile, but failed. "But the vault should contain roughly 6 million idols, and papers of a value of maybe 6 million more. Although their value is hard to know for sure at this moment. Furthermore, the bank holds artwork and alike for around 2 million idols."\n\nIgnatius nodded. The griffon was honest, or at least knew that any tomfoolery at this moment would be suicidal. "A healthy liquidity for sure. Skyfall's traders always knew how to make a profit. A shame that they decided to not share it with the Emperor. But this is of no importance anymore.

My travels were most pleasant, and my estates had bountiful harvests. The Empire is prospering under your guidance. It seems to me, that your regency of the Empire is truly blessed by the Gods. May I congratulate you on your latest successes?"\n\nIgnatius showed a slight smile. The exchange of pleasantries went on for a while, as was usual for conversations between nobles, particularly during official invites. Eventually, a servant served a light snack, and the conversation could come to the heart of the matter.\n\n"Now, my lady, may I ask if you have considered my proposition? Your record of service to the Empire is surely impressive, and I would be most grateful if the Empire could rely on your support again." Lady Diana tilted her head. "As I said in my letter, I can offer you to oversee the department of agriculture in the Imperial administration. The task in this is twofold: To organize the food supply across the Empire, but also to make sure that the landed estates, the true pillar of the Imperial rule, are heard in their needs. And I cannot imagine somegriff better suited for this position that you are."\n\n"Your words hold truth, Regent Ignatius. In the last thirty years that I've managed my estates, I have learned a thing or two about agriculture, and also have made contact with many of my peers. When I got your offer, I was therefore already decided to accept it. I will gladly serve the Empire once more.""

 bronzehill_ignatius.8.d:0 "Ignatius sat before his desk and shuffled through some conversations. The abrupt end to Eros' regency had left the Archonate of Boreas without an Archon. So far, he had just stalled any efforts to elect a new one... but no more. In the last weeks, he instead had invited several high-ranking clergy members into the palace, and visited more around Herzland. And now he felt ready that the new election could come.\n\nTraditionally, the elections of a new Archon were a highly secretive affair. Only the highest members of the Archonate were invited, and then choose one of their own as new representative of their god. This gave the Archonates a considerable amount of independence – they were not beholden to the Emperor or the Empire. The Temples they oversaw formed a parallel structure to the Imperial government, with the tithes they collected being their own to manage as they pleased.\n\nBut now there was an opening. The Archonate of Boreas was the highest among them, and its top position being vacant left the entire temple structure in a limbo state, which had weakened them already. The new Archon would be elected shortly, and officially the ceremony was as secret as always. But Ignatius had made sure that all of the griffons involved knew the position of the Emperor. And also that the continued cooperation with the government would be positively affected if his majesty's preferred candidate would be chosen.\n\nA few hours later, a courier arrived from the Grand Temple of Boreas. The new Archon was chosen, and it was Ignatius' favourite. She had taken the name of Agatha II. And this now opened even more possibilities. In the future, cooperation between Emperor and temples would be much smoother. And much more one-sided."

Agatha II seemed much more comfortable with the status quo than he had hoped for. His reform propositions got blocked by the established priests, and even though he had moved Agatha into her new position just a few month ago, she was refusing to grant priesthood to his preferred appointees.\n\nHe snorted with anger. Fine then! Maybe he should have done more. But he had an Empire to run on the side, and not all of his efforts could go into just one project, regardless of how important it was. But this was still... He sighed. How could his efforts gone so wrong?\n\nBut now there was only one thing left to do, namely to call this whole operation off. The relations with the temples had been strained by his constant reform efforts, and any more interference could cause the anger to boil over.

 bronzehill_ignatius.10.t:0 "Token Reforms"
 bronzehill_ignatius.10.d:0 "The reports piled up on Ignatius' desk. Protocols from many committee meetings, letters from and to all sorts of priests and files about temple conduct in various cases. If somedog was to look at all of this from the outside, surely they would think that sweeping reforms were enacted. The reality was much more mundane.\n\nThe Imperial regent had of course read all of these papers. He had made comments on some of them, with rather unstatesmanlike highlights such as "fire this idiot" and "Maar damn these temples". Yet, the result was still meagre. The established structures in the end had proven to be a rather heavy obstacle.\n\nBut on the other paw, it had not entirely been for naught. After heavy pressure, the Emperor could now veto appointments to prelates to the various regions to the Empire. Also, the temples had to give the Imperial administration access to their records, which would make any future efforts of the priesthood to bribe public officials much harder.\n\nIgnatius rang a bell in his office and a servant appeared promptly. "Take these reports to the archive. I... I no longer need them." The servant nodded and left with claws full of paper, despite not even carrying half the documents. He shook his head. Was it right to give up now? He knew the answer was yes, but it was hard to come to terms with it. The mood among the priests was deteriorating, and further reform efforts could bring about the collapse of everything achieved so far. But he had had so many plans – now they would be all buried. Maybe Grover could do another round of reform, once he had come of age."

His time and effort had not been wasted – in the future the Emperor would have a much greater say in the affairs of the Archonates. Sure, there were those who resisted his efforts, and some of the more ambitious reforms were ultimately shot down, but this was to be expected.\n\nBut why stop here? Ignatius could feel the temptation to just keep pushing, but his carefulness prevailed. Yes, most reports were positive, but the temples showed clear signs of exhaustion from reforms. If he was to keep going, the mood could flip, and all the things he achieved so far would be in question once more.\n\nRegardless, the list of reforms was impressive. The Emperor would now be officially consulted before the election of a new Archon, and while this consultation technically wasn't binding, the temples knew they depended on good cooperation. The tithes that the people owed the temples were now collected by the Imperial bureaucracy. Officially this was a privilege the Emperor bestowed on the temples, but in reality it would soon make the temples completely reliant on the secular structures of government. And the last and greatest reforms, the temple courts responsible to punish crimes against religious law were abolished and these cases integrated into the secular court structure.\n\nWith a smile on his face, the Imperial regent pulled his seal and pressed it onto the decree before him. The hard work of months would finally come to a good end."

 bronzehill_ignatius.12.d:0 "Ignatius could not stop to grin as the read through the reports. One after another, the temples had budged and made way to sweeping reform. The independent Archonates of the past were done for, from now on the Emperor would hold all the strings in his claws. Not even he himself had truly believed that the temples would accept all of his reforms, but with just the right incentives – and threats – he had accomplished a masterpiece.\n\nAnd of course, the new Archon Agatha II had been a useful asset. Not because she was overly eager to reform, no, but because she was gullible and weak, like wax in Ignatius' firm paws. Great effort and time had been poured into these reforms. He had worked day and night for the last months, with countless letters and visits to various clergy. But could there have been a greater reward then what was before him?\n\nThe most important reform was that from now on, the Emperor would appoint the Archons. While they technically still needed confirmation from a collegium of clergygriffs, this would be just a formality. Further, the temples would no longer collect a tithe, but instead they would receive idols from the Imperial treasury. The former tithes would be integrated into the Imperial tax codes, to be paid fairly by all those who owed to the gods. With their monetary independence lost, the temples could no longer hope to be able to corrupt officials of the Empire. As a third reform, the Emperor would directly appoint all prelates for the various regions of the Empire, including the right to recall them at any point, for any reason. And finally, the temple courts for religious crimes would be totally abolished, all religious laws be integrated into the Imperial code, to be overseen by the Emperor, with the secular courts taking on all those cases in the future.\n\nAs Ignatius pressed his seal into the decree before him, he could not stop to wag his tail in excitement. The Emperor would get a stable Empire, only beholden to him."

The feathers on his head had become thin already and also otherwise he looked like a bit too much beer. After they had sat down, he started to speak in a slightly hoarse voice: "The Imperial Regent! What an honour. I am... My estate is all your, your highness. Please, come with me. My servants should serve us some drinks in a moment." He led Ignatius to some office.\n\nAfter the mandatory exchange of some pleasantries, Ignatius decided to come to the reason for his visit. "Mister Geldsack, I come here to Skyfall to once again decide the future politics of the city. It goes without saying that many of the previous notables have proven to be treasonous, and so there will be major shifts in the power structure. From all I heard however, your family has proven to be a rare exception among the patricians here, right?"\n\nThe griffon was quick to agree. "My dear Imperial regent, I can tell you that! My family has always stood with the Emperor. Skyfall's independence was a mistake, my father had said this and I brought it up whenever I had the chance. But we were not heard. The self-styled 'Iron Chancellor' has led us to ruin! The once prosperous businesses of the Geldsacks are a shadow of their former self. Loosing connection to Herzland has hurt our coffers dearly. Thank Boreas that my grandfather didn't have to see this, he died a year before the revolution started. The Geldsacks once were on of the most respected families in Skyfall, yes, we really were. It went all downhill since the Maar-damned uprising and this... this pretender Guichard."\n\n"Well, well." Ignatius showed a smile. "Then my offer can give you satisfaction. I would be inclined to make you the new major of Skyfall, that is." He heard how the griffon gasped for air. "If you feel ready for the task, that is. And of course, Skyfall's relationship with the palace is still a matter of debate."\n\nThe griffon showed slight nervousness when he answered: "I... thank you. You bestow a great honour on me. I will do my best to please the Emperor.""

 bronzehill_ignatius.14.t:0 "What The Palace Needs"
 bronzehill_ignatius.14.d:0 "His regent had invited Grover to join him for a meeting with architects. Apparently, the old dog planned to renovate parts of the Imperial palace, or so he had understood. While it didn't promise to become all that interesting, he figured that learning how to plan buildings was part of the job as an Emperor. As Ignatius had also told him, later as Emperor he would need to build monuments to his rule and so a basic understanding of architecture would help him.\n\nIgnatius picked him up from his chambers. On the way Grover asked his regent: "My regent, I don't think I even know yet what parts of the palace you want to renovate. I... eh... sometimes wander around in the palace, and I haven't noticed anything in disrepair."\n\n"My Emperor, I believe there is a misunderstanding. My intent is not to renovate a part of the palace – or rather, those things are handled by the palace architect and not a matter for the Emperor personally. Instead my intent is to expand the Imperial palace, to build a brand new wing."\n\n"For what reason? I have lived in the palace for my entire life and I couldn't claim to know all of it. It is the largest building in Griffenheim by far, and Boreas knows, probably in the whole Empire! Why would we need yet more rooms and halls and chambers?"\n\n"Ah, the reason is not that we strictly need it. But the purpose of a palace is not merely to provide an amicable dwelling, no, the purpose is far higher than that. The palace needs to represent the splendour of the Emperor. A visitor entering the palace, nay, just looking at the palace, needs to be blown away, in awe, the muzzle – or beak – wide open. The palace is the first thing that nobles coming from far away to pay homage to you will see. If they can feel your power, they will continue to be loyal. If they sense weakness however..."\n\n\n\n"Well, I guess you're right. And actually, this reminds of some interesting ideas from a book I read. Do you think we can use crystal as material?""

 bronzehill_ignatius.15.t:0 "The Fischerfest"
 bronzehill_ignatius.15.d:0 "Woofrey Pawner looked around the market. He and his wife Barkah had travelled from Bronzekreuz to Ravensburg to visit the yearly Fischerfest (fair of fishers). While they sold fresh fish from the Ravenlake at the Fischermeile all year around, this time in the year they celebrated the founding of fisher guild, which claimed to be the oldest guild in Ravensburg.\n\nThe market was filled with various stands and attractions. But the most impressive thing was undoubtedly the big wheel, a giant rotating steel wheel with gondolas attached. Woofrey had never seen something similar and even his wife – notoriously hard to fascinate by anything – was thrilled to make a tour. When they stepped into one of the gondolas, he had to admit that he felt a little nervous, but Barkah was all the more enthusiastic. As they reached the top, they could look all over Ravensburg.\n\n"Look, Woofrey, there is the Temple! And there is the Kaiserplatz. Can you see the statue of Grover II? And look over there, there the Raven flows. Can you see it? I still don't like the new dam, it destroyed the peaceful flow of the river. But can you see it?"\n\nWoofrey could not see it, mostly because he refused to look outside of the cabin at all. For him, the height was far too high, and the thought that this was all just a steel wheel was quite uncomfortable for him. But they reached the ground safely, leaving him with only a slight feel of dizziness.\n\nAfter they had exited, he discovered a little shield on the entry: "Donated by the Imperial government – department for maintaining traditions". For all the warring and empire-building the government did, they at least also spend some of their idols for the people. Life was not as bad as it could be."

 bronzehill_ignatius.16.t:0 "The Birthplace"
 bronzehill_ignatius.16.d:0 "As Ignatius reached the small village at the foot of the mountain, he could feel the gazes of the griffons. Not many griffons went on a pilgrimage to the birthplace of their kind these days, the world had become too turbulent, too filled with new ideals and modernization. But Ignatius' visit was special even more, for he was a diamond dog and not a griffon.\n\nHe had taken this journey incognito, to not be burdened by the necessities of courtly life. News would eventually get out, and he could imagine that many in the Empire would dismiss his travels as a mere propaganda stunt. But it wasn't. Here, Ignatius hoped to contemplate about questions that had rumoured in his head for a while.\n\nHe passed through the village and walked along the trail leading up the mountain. It was forbidden for griffons to use their wings here, and he could understand why they would be tempted. It wasn't an easy way, in a stony and barren landscape. His surroundings were quiet, and the time ripe for delving into questions.\n\nSince his puphood, the Trinity had been a part of Ignatius' life. The vast majority of dogs in Bronzehill were followers of Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius. Yet, in all the stories and sermons, these Gods were the Gods of the griffons, while diamond dogs were barely mentioned. In some sermons back home, the legends had been adapted, but as he became Imperial regent and spoke with clergy from other parts of the Empire, they never mentioned the diamond dogs even once.\n\nAfter a while, the trail stopped. Little figurines marked the beginning of the divine world, and the border for any mortal being. Ignatius took the time to look upon the world below him. If the clergy couldn't come up with answers, he would seek them himself. Feeling deep inside him, his vision became clear. He could feel a close connection to the gods. Their power had created the world, and they had created the diamond dogs just as they had created the griffons. But Solarspike was the birthplace of the griffons, and only the griffons. For the birthplace of the dogs, he would need to keep searching."

 bronzehill_ignatius.17.t:0 "The Birthplace Of The Dogs"
 bronzehill_ignatius.17.d:0 "It was a strange feeling standing here. Everything around him felt familiar, yet so foreign at the same time. When the armies of the Empire had conquered Diamond Mountain, Ignatius hadn't planned to visit it personally. Yet, he had questions on his mind, and the only place for answers was in these caves.\n\nHis visit in Solarspike had given him two certainties. The first was that his faith in the gods was reaffirmed. He hadn't been the most religious of dogs for most of his life, seeing the temples as little more than tools in operating an Empire. But the temples were one thing and the gods another entirely. He was certain that the Trinity – and Maar – had created the diamond dogs just like the griffons. But the second certainty from his visit on Solarspike had been that this mountain was the birthplace of the griffons – and only the griffons.\n\nIf he wanted to find the birthplace of the dogs, what place would be more logical than Diamond Mountain? For all history provides, this was the first – and only – kingdom of the dogs. If the dogs were uplifted by the gods similar to the griffons, it must have been around here.\n\nOn these thoughts, Ignatius wanted to explore the caves of Dogaz-dûm. Taking the old dogish words into his mouth made him feel strange. He tried to remember what he knew of dogish to translate a prayer to the trinity into this language. Speaking these words – almost forgotten by him – gave him a new, clear mind. He was now ready to be led by the gods, to find the true birthplace of doghood.\n\nWandering deeper and deeper, he could feel the air change. But unlike on Solarspike, it wasn't becoming thinner, instead it felt more earthy, denser and warmer. This was much more natural to him then what he had experienced there. Here, down in the depths of the world, the diamond dogs were given bodies by Eyr, given strength by Arcturius and intellect by Boreas. And souls by Maar. At a point, he stopped wandering. Here, deep down was a much a realm of the gods as it was up on Solarspike. As mere mortal, his search would end here, for everything more was beyond his reach."

All around the capital citizens of the Empire were waking up; preparing for another day, working toward a brighter future. A future that he would soon no longer play a leading role in shaping. The dog drew in a deep steady breath, held it for a moment, and then exhaled into the crisp morning air before him. He stood up as if a hefty burden had been lifted from his back.\n\nFrom behind him, Ignatius heard a door click closed and talons clacking on stone. The newcomer's confident gait betrayed them. "Good morning, Grover."\n\n"Good morning, Ignatius," Grover says, before joining Ignatius at the railing. The two sat in amiable silence for a minute before Grover spoke up. "This is nice but, the advisors have brought us the industrial reports you requested yesterday and are waiting for us to begin the audits. It'd be rude to keep them waiting."\n\nIgnatius didn't turn to Grover, but he did crack a grin. It seemed Grover's sense of punctuality had finally grown to match his own. An important quality for a ruler. "Why don't you get started without me today?"\n\nGrover turned to Ignatius, briefly looking him over. "Start without you? What for? Are you unwell?"\n\nIgnatius chuckled, "No, no, nothing like that. I just think you can handle it, is all," he said as he turned to give Grover a reassuring pat on the shoulder."

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.1.t:0 "A Different Lecture"
 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.1.d:0 "The wind caressed Grover's beak as he looked out of the car. A week ago, his regent had visited him after his lectures, and offered Grover "a different kind of lecture". 'Your lectures in literature, languages, math, history and the natural sciences are all important for a good ruler. But this, I believe, can be a lecture in rulership itself.'\n\nDuring the last week, Ignatius and he had cruised across the country side. They had visited various villages and took part in a variety of events. Ignatius had planned the route carefully, as in almost every larger settlement they visited, there was some event happening. In one town, it had been a 500 year anniversary, the next just had a feast celebrating a local folk hero and in a third case, it had been the birthday of the local noble. Each and every time, Ignatius had told him about the nature of the event before, and asked Grover to prepare something he wanted to say. It would only be a few words, but he would practice with his regent before, and then speak them during the event. Afterwards, Ignatius would hold a much longer speech, but the locals seemed much more interested in Grover.\n\nNow they were on the way home. Grover's reminiscence was interrupted when Ignatius asked him: "Now, my Emperor, this was your first practical lesson in rulership. What do you think was important during this week? What have you learned?"\n\nGrover took a moment before he answered. "It looked to me that they appreciated when I said something to them. So, I think, a good Emperor needs to show his subject that he cares, right? I've heard you talking a lot about how the nobility has an obligation towards the peasants they rule over to provide for them in times of need. The Emperor then has the same obligation towards all of them.""

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.2.d:0 "His lectures for the day were out, and so Grover decided to simply walk through the palace. The Imperial palace was enormous in size, and flying from one side to the other could take five minutes if you included the gardens. But Grover was in no mood to fly. His last lesson had been dancing, and his head still spun about the various sequences. And of course it was not easy to balance oneself on the hind paws all the time. As his dancing teacher told him, flapping his wings for easier balancing was considered "unrefined" – and therefore not good enough for an Emperor.\n\nBut this was not the strangest part about these lectures. The dances he practiced were for pairs, and so he needed a partner. In his mind, he could have just chosen someone he liked, but his regent insisted that the Emperor dancing with the same griffoness, even if just for practice, would "send the wrong signals". What a chaos for nothing! If it was for him, he would have just chosen the daughter of some servant if the nobles would seriously lose their feathers about such trivialities. But no, instead he had to dance with a different noble chick from the court for each lesson.\n\nBut maybe it wasn't as boring for them as it was for him. Some of these girls looked quite nervous, even if it was just for some dumb lecture. And all of them were rather over styled for this mundane occasion. The more he thought about it, the more he came to the realization that for his dancing partners, it likely really was a special moment. Sure, for him they were all just some nobles, but for them, he was the Emperor...\n\nGrover clacked his beak, both annoyed and embarrassed by this thought. He had been rude to some of them for no good reason, and thinking back, in these moments they had seemed almost scared. But also, why was his life so Maar-damn complicated? Why couldn't he just practice dancing in peace?"

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.3.d:0 "Grover and Ignatius arrived on the military restricted area near Helheim. After he had beseeched his regent for almost half a year, Ignatius had agreed that he could drive around in a real tank. Grover had been fascinated by these armoured monsters as far back as he could think, and he always wanted to try what it felt like to operate one.\n\nOn the military area, they were welcomed by a very strict – and strong – looking griff. Grover was not sure if he should be scared, but as the soldier looked at him, he showed a wide smile. "Welcome, my Emperor. I'm Thomas Stifftail from the 3rd Imperial tank brigade. Do you want to drive a tank?" Grover nodded. "Then follow me. We got a real beauty over here, fresh from the factory. One of the really heavy ones. I wish we could get those monsters when driving into battle." He led out a quick laughter.\n\nThomas led Grover and Ignatius to a true beast of a tank. Grover flew up to the top and crawled into the tank. Here, three other griffons already waited for him. Thomas followed him shortly after, and then went on to explain Grover how such a tank operated. "So, my Emperor. You get to be the driver, as I think you'll like that. We have a free field before us, a test field were we try out new equipment. Marcus here is the gunner, Julia is the loader and Lisa the radio operator. I'm the commander, as usual. So even though you are the Emperor, you should listen what I say, right?" Thomas gave Grover a wink.\n\nAfter Thomas had explained Grover the pedals and how to look out for where he was driving, they started the tour. It was quite the experience. A lot tighter than Grover had expected, even in such a large tank, and also everything shook and jerked as they rolled over just grassland, which was quite uncomfortable. As climax, Grover was allowed to tell Marcus to fire a shot. He could feel the tank vibrating as the round left the barrel, and shortly afterwards he heard a big boom."

 bronzehill_ignatiusgrover.4.d:0 ""My Emperor, would you allow me to interrupt you for a moment?" Grover, sitting on his desk over some books, looked up. "Tomorrow I and some senior administrators will hold a meeting to discuss the economic development of the Empire. I believe that it could be interesting for you to partake. As I hear, you are making great progress in your studies, but seeing the practical side of things is always a different experience altogether."\n\nGrover quickly agreed, and so the next morning, his usual lectures had to wait. Ignatius picked him up from the Royal Chambers, and together they went to the meeting. As they arrived at the meeting room, his regent introduced the participants to him: "My Emperor, this is Johanna Whitetail from the department of economic development. You have probably heard of her in your studies, as she is responsible for the IEDI plan, right? And here is Diana von Mirabelle from the department of agriculture. She is responsible for managing the food supply across the Empire, a serious task as she has to hold contact with many local nobles." The dog and griffoness bowed before the Emperor, and then the meeting could begin.\n\nWhat followed was completely different from what Grover had expected. He had either assumed some dry, sluggish scrolling throw stacks of paper or some highly ceremonial affair like when holding court, but it was neither of those. While Johanna and Diana both had brought stacks of papers, together with various diagrams, it was more a brainstorming type of meeting. Discuss what worked and worked not economically, find inefficiencies and come up with new ideas. Grover quickly found himself drawn into the discussion, and to his surprise, his ideas were not ignored or dismissed, however also not easily accepted. All the knowledge that he had learned during his studies – how many boring hours had it been – suddenly felt relevant, as he tried to remember everything he learned to make a fruitful contribution."

Now he had found the time to read it once more, as a throwback to younger, easier times, or so it felt to him. But there were certain aspects that he had not remembered from reading it as a cub. Why did Prince Strongclaw go out to rescue Princess Anita from the dragons? He had always assumed it was only "what knights do", and that the two ended up marrying held little relevance to him as a child.\n\nHe got up from his armchair to lie on his bed. Love - what a strange thing for sure. He could feel that he had changed from just a two or three years back. He noticed the chicks of his court, and he wondered how things would develop. Ignatius had told him, that as the Emperor, he would need to be careful and vigilant at all times. Noble families would fight for his grace, even and especially by matters of love. 'But the duty of an Emperor always comes first', Ignatius had said. 'You might not understand it now, but in our spheres any feelings need to take a backseat to politics.'\n\nBut Ignatius warning was only half the truth, Grover figured. Some noble daughters from the court had tried to approach him, but their advances had been as boring as transpicuous. And when he felt the courage to talk to one of them on his own, they would react scared and submissive. Sure, some acted tough, but he could feel that their overwhelmed self underneath that.\n\nHe let out another sigh. Sometimes, he thought, being just a normal griff would make things easier. This was certainly one of those cases. He would surely end up marrying some griffoness, and with a bit of luck she would be friendly and good-looking. But in moments like this, he doubted that he could ever experience something like Prince Strongclaw. Princess Anita had the standing to give her prince contra, and their love was built on true respect for each other. What future wife could give him that?"

It was a rare occasion that it was just the two of them, as normally some other nobles would join them for the privilege of dining with the Emperor. But today was an exception, not by happenstance, but because Grover had told Ignatius that he wanted to discuss something. As they sat over a plate of meatballs and cheese, the old dog looked at Grover curiously, waiting for the Emperor to start.\n\n"Ignatius, my regent, the matter I wanted your opinion on was this declaration I found when I toured the city the other day. I asked my servants to bring me a copy, so that I could take a closer look." Grover produced a scroll of paper. "Here. It states, that the Emperor, so I, 'hold council with Boreas'. Now, I try to be a pious griff for sure, but I certainly can't claim as much as is written here."\n\nIgnatius showed a smile. "My Emperor, I understand your reservations. But when we talk to the common griff, some romantic hyperbole is almost expected. As the symbol of griffonhood itself, why shouldn't the populace think that you have a more direct connection to the Gods? For them, it is the same anyways. You rule by the grace of Boreas, the priests praise you name and the knights swear their oath to both the Gods and you."\n\nGrover twisted his beak. "You make it seem like I'm the fourth among them! Romantic hyperbole for sure, but we should know measure and limit. So far, I cannot claim divine inspiration in anything – even though that would make my life quite a bit easier."\n\n"Yes, my Emperor, we all wish that some higher deity would guide us easily. But the world is more mundane than the temples claim, and we have to make our own decisions, for better or worse. And as we do so, we need to keep up the appearance in some matters. In reality, you will rather council with some nobles. What is written here is to justify the actions of the government by giving it divine backing. The message is that defying you, or the Empire, means abandoning the Gods, and this is all your citizens need to know."

Grover I with the Idol of Boreas, Grover II as mighty warrior, Grover III as respected lawgiver and Grover IV surrounded by other nobles feasting. And then of course, his father, Grover V. Even through the artists indulgent view one could see the sickly stature of the poor griffon.\n\nIn less than a year time, it would be his turn. True, Grover V was denied his crown for longer, but he trusted Ignatius. The old dog would not deny him his birth right. Quite the contrary, Grover suspected his regent to count the days more than he did. And then? What would he do with the crown?\n\nFor a moment, Grover felt sombre, but then a wave on enthusiasm swapped over him. Enough of this nonsense! He was a great griffon, not as sickly as his father, not as fat or anaemic as his grandfather. Ignatius had made a terrific job of preparing the Empire, and now Grover would lead it to prosperity and greatness. Life opened before him, he would have a trusted panel of advisors ready to help him and he already had plenty of ideas for what he wanted to do.\n\nHe continued to wander the gallery, admiring the paintings with scenes of Grover I and II. Art really could inspire, and he felt inspired as never before. Of course, he reminded himself, he should keep Ignatius' teaching in mind – greatness was not a goal in of itself, and an overambitious Emperor could harm the Empire as much as a slacking one.

Of course, he had already had a few dances, but now had decided to get a glass of Vinovian wine.\n\nAs he took a slight sip from his glass, his mind went back to a similar scene, many years ago when he was a cub.

Even back then, the old dog had prophesied that once day, he would organize his own ball, and sure enough, Ignatius had been correct. He also remembered how exhausting it all had been, how overwhelming and tiring. In that, practice makes perfect. He had danced thousands of hours since then and had visited hundreds of balls. He remembered how his hind paws hurt after just an hour of dancing, back in the day when he was beginning to take dancing lessons. Now, it all was coming natural to him. He didn't have to think about his movements or words, every possible sentence of noble conversation being ingrained in his mind.\n\nHe put his glass on the tabled of a waiter nearby and approached a griffoness his age. Upon hearing his soft "May I?", she blushed, but nodded and took his offered claws. The orchestra had just started playing a waltz and so they glided over the dance floor. "You must be daughter of Baroness de Becsville, right? I'm glad that you took the journey all the way from Westkeep over to here, to experience my little ball."\n\nHe could hear her heart pumping, and he caught her flapping her wings in excitement. When she answered, it was little more than a whisper: "It's very nice. I... I believe you are a great Emperor." Grover smiled."

 bronzehill_ignatiuspostcoronation.2.d:0 "The Imperial train let out a loud whistle as it reached Bronzekreuz. It was the first of many stops in a planned roundtrip of the Emperor. As Grover exited the train, he was enthusiastically welcomed by the diamond dogs. The train station was decorated in Imperial colours and the crowds chanted "Hail Grover" and "Long live the Emperor".\n\nHowever, the train trip was special for Grover in some ways. After some efforts, he had persuaded his former regent into accompanying him on this trip. And so, the old dog was trotting behind Grover when he was welcomed by Crown Prince Barnaby. The son of Ignatius had taken over command of the old county as Ignatius became regent in Griffenheim. Grover knew that the relationship between the two was not the greatest – Barnaby had favoured a more liberal Empire and less reliance on noble leadership.\n\nAs they went all three – together with some guards – towards Bronzekreuz Castle, Grover also thought about a different topic. This stop had also been the first on the train trip of his late father, Grover V. Back then, the Imperial High-Speed Rail had just been started, and his father had vowed to tour his – then greatly diminished – Empire with it. As fate had it, this had been too much for his sickly nature, and Grover V had died just a month after returning.\n\nOf course, Grover felt not sick at all, and to the contrary was enthusiastic about seeing his Empire. He had sat in his old palace for most of his cubhood, and he would likely continue to do so as an Emperor, so this was a nice change. But following the pawsteps of his late father still gave him a sombre mood at times.\n\nThe three arrived at Bronzehill Castle, were they held a little private audience. If Grover had feared tensions between Count and Crown Prince, he was luckily wrong. Barnaby instead pledged his full loyalty to him, and father and son had a long and sincere hug. Seeing the two united in support of him warmed Grover's heart. This was truly a good omen."

 bronzehill_ignatiuspostcoronation.3.d:0 "It had been a long day. Grover had given out medals to some of the oldest dog units of the Reichsarmee – some of the soldiers had fought for him more than a decade. It had been an emotional event for sure, and seeing the scarred dogs had reminded Grover how much he owed to his loyal Bronzehillians.\n\nBut there was one dog who Grover owed more to than any other, his former regent Ignatius. The old dog had agreed to stay in the Imperial castle, and so Grover made his way to Ignatius' rooms. He had to try... again...\n\nEven, or maybe especially as Emperor, Grover would not just disturb his old mentor. But the servant he had sent soon returned and told him that Ignatius would be ready to receive him. He found the old dog lounging in a chair and nibbling meat biscuits. "Welcome, my Emperor. It was a long day, wasn't it? I've heard you honoured the old guard today. But I'm glad you remembered me as well." The dog smirked.\n\n"Those medals were only for soldiers, so I come empty-clawed, Ignatius. But you are right that the ceremony sent me back into memories, and now I'm in the mood to remembering my cubhood. The good old times."\n\n"Where they all that good? The Empire... it was rebuild with blood and iron. But I trust you that you don't forget that. And I know you, my Emperor. If you come to me like that, you also want something. Am I right?"\n\n"If you ask me so directly. I indeed wanted to ask you if you thought about my offer, my regent. Your experience would be invaluable for me when managing the Empire. And I still have so much to learn from you."\n\n"I'm not your regent anymore, my Emperor, just an old dog who is retired. I have led the Empire for long enough, and now I ask for nothing more than to live out my twilight years in peace. But more so, I know that you have it in you. Me meddling in the administration would not work for good. And you have learned so much – not just from me. You will be a great Emperor, and I can only claim a minor part in what will be your legacy.""

 bronzehill_ignatiuspostcoronation.4.d:0 "Grover returned to his chambers after meeting with some nobles. He flew around in his room, landing on various old and expensive furnishings. These nobles were so full of themselves! He was really worked up about it. Had they not listened to Ignatius' lectures? He sighed. They probably really hadn't.\n\nWould this be his future? Working with noble pricks, who cared about nothing but their titles and privileges? No, not if it was for him. Of course, he acknowledged their role in rebuilding the Empire, and some might even have taken his regents calls for restraint to heart. But he wasn't sure that these formed the majority of the nobility.\n\nHe stopped for a moment to think about this point. What was it that made nobles so secure of their right to rule the lands? Probably that they never had somegriff tell them otherwise. But he himself... He was in the same position as them, if not more so. He had been Emperor as long as his memory reached back... And Ignatius had only ever reinforced his right to rule... He would need to think about this more. How much had parted him from becoming a self-indulgent noble, maybe the most self-indulgent of them all? Ignatius' lectures... and his will to see the world with his own eyes...\n\nAfter an hour of flying around – and with one vase less in his room – he had cooled down enough to land on the chair in front of his desk. It was time to get to work, and so he grabbed a sheet of paper and sketched out his ideas. He would hold on to rule by decree, at least for now, but it was time to get some commoners in higher positions."

 bronzehill_ignatiuspostcoronation.5.d:0 "As Max Rotwing opened the door, the temperature in the room seemed to drop by ten degrees. It took all his resolve to not back out immediately. But no, he had every right to be here, Max thought, he was elected in free and fair elections just like the rest of them. In fact, these had been the first truly fair elections as far as he could remember – prior to that, simple griffons like him were not even allowed to vote.\n\nBut now Grover had changed this. Now, the city councils were elected by everygriff, independently of income. Even more, Grover had lifted the ban of socialist parties. Sure, their campaign had been hindered by the police, the council and strict laws around lèse-majesté, but their principle aim of representing worker's rights was not outright illegal anymore.\n\n"Councillor Rotwing?" asked a rather fat griffon in an expensive suit. "Come on in, and welcome to the council." Despite his words, his voice was rather pressed. "I believe that we are now complete, and so, I would like to formally open this period of the council. As I can see, we have quite a few new beaks here – in no doubt due to the recent decrees of our beloved Emperor. In light of this, I want to remind everygriff here to read the house rules if you have not done so already. And also, as you represent the city at large, please pay attention to dress accordingly." This one was for him. "Well, let us start with electing a new president of the council."\n\nThe first session of the council went on for quite a while. Max Rotwing had taken his seat, and voted on the president as well as proposed changes to the house rules. But he could feel the glances of his fellow council members. He was not a noble, and also not rich. He could only speculate how long these "most esteemed griffons" had met here to decide on laws and policies without any commoner getting in their way. But now, it was his time to speak.\n\n"Dear honourable colleagues, I am happy to be able to speak here today. I am here the lone representative of the Freiheitliche Arbeiterpartei, and it will be my aim to bring in some matters that are of great importance to me and my fellow workers.""

Grover had danced many dances, and the laughs of coquettish griffonesses had brought a smile to his face. The stress of ruling could get strong at times, but now he would enjoy a good night.\n\nBut before that, he decided to visit his former regent. The old dog had stayed in the Imperial palace by Grover's own wish. It was calming to know that his long-time mentor was still around, although Ignatius had refused any place in his administration with utmost certainty.\n\nGrover wouldn't allow himself to just entre Ignatius' rooms without an invite, and so he had sent a servant. The servant promptly returned, stating that the old dog would receive his Emperor. As he entered, he found Ignatius sitting in his chair before his desk, working on some documents. As he heard the pawsteps, he turned around and said: "Welcome, my Emperor. The dances today were wonderful, a nice event. You have to excuse me for leaving early, I don't have the energy of my puppy years anymore. Are you here to scold me? But I saw you had good company." The dog smirked.\n\n"No, Ignatius, you were in your full right to leave whenever you felt tired. This wasn't one of my... official balls anyways. But I'm glad that you are still awake, as I've come to talk to you in private. Tell, me openly, what do you think of my reforms?" Grover had an anxious glance on his former regent, like a pupil who worried about a bad grade.\n\n"Well, my Emperor, you do things differently to me. But that doesn't mean you do it wrong. You have taken my lectures, and you interpret them your way. I would be rather more worried if you would cling onto my approach to ruling. I have full trust in your capabilities. You have to go your own way, and write your own legacy.""

 # Barnaby Regency
 
 bronzehill_barnaby.1.t:0 "The Party Conference"
 bronzehill_barnaby.1.d:0 "Copperhill had known for a long time that this moment would come, at yet, he was still unsure of how to feel about it. A while ago, he and Barnaby had discussed the politics of the Empire after the unification of the Herzland would be complete. 'We cannot wait until we have reunited the Empire. We need to deliver true reform to the people. The party must grow, and democracy needs to be established.' Barnaby was certainly "the young reformer", but he wasn't so comfortable about being labelled "the old reformer" anymore.\n\nTo some extent, he envied Barnaby and his seemingly endless energy. But it was more than that. The party reorganization – it was the regents project more than his. But Barnaby just seemed to assume that he would then work with all the new faces. And while Barnaby didn't demand him to leave his office, he knew very well what would come. Free election, of course. And if the newly minted Pan-Griffonian Harmonic Party should lose these elections, he would be expected to resign in grace and watch the politics from the side lines. It would be Barnaby who would stay and manage the transition.\n\nThe protégé had outgrown the mentor. He took a heavy breath, before entering the stage. "Dear griffons and dogs, welcome to this party conference of the Harmonic-Conservative Party, as long as our party is still called that." He showed a smile, but it was more nostalgic than anything else. "We have invited many esteemed reformers from all over Herzland, and of course, our noble goal is reorganize under the banners of Harmony and Pan-Griffonianism. We dearly hope that all of those who share these goals can find their place in forging a true, united party of the whole of the Empire."\n\nAfter speaking for maybe half an hour more, outlining the future of the party, it was time for him to pass on the microphone. Now, many representatives of minor harmonic parties from all over Herzland would speak. And afterwards, these parties would be formally merged into the grand new Pan-Griffonian Harmonic Party. Then a party board would be elected. And finally, he would hold meetings to discuss a shuffeling of the – currently still very dog dominated – cabinet."

 bronzehill_barnaby.2.t:0 "The Constitutional Committee"
 bronzehill_barnaby.2.d:0 "Despite the age and status of the griffons in the room, the atmosphere was tense. Apparently, being a professor at a prestigious university didn't make griffons less inclined to brawl, thought Barnaby. But with occasional calls to order, it could be limited to occasional angry stares or claw shakes. This of course didn't change the fact that the griffons barely could agree on anything. And these they called Herzland's best lawyers. Barnaby sighed.\n\nIt would get better in time, or so he hoped. For now, all that remained was to open the first committee meeting. "Dear members of the constitutional committee, as Imperial Regent it is an honour for me to open this committee. It has long been a goal of mine to implement a truly constitutional rule. Now, we are in a position where we can strive to finally achieve this. We are now tasked with writing a constitution, for the first time in this Empire's history – at least, if we leave out the traitors of 978.\n\nAs loyal followers of his majesty Emperor Grover VI, it stands without question that his position is not to be touched. Yet, in the new constitutional environment that we are posed to build, other institutions will come into play that limit the power the Emperor has traditionally enjoyed. We will have a parliament, freely elected by all subjects of his majesty, which will be tasked with overseeing the laws the Imperial government wants to bring to the Empire. And of course, an important question will be the court system, to grant everyone in the Empire equal rights before the law. We will have to outline the fundamental rights that each citizen of the Empire enjoys, so that our Empire can remain strong while simultaneously all people can live up to their full potential. Because nothing less is the goal of this committee: To make sure that in the future, the Empire is a force for liberty and freedom, free from the tyranny of the past. And on that note, I want to thank you all for participating here, and may our aspirations be fulfilled."\n\nTo his surprise, all members of the committee gave him applause, and for a moment, it seemed like a quiet and peaceful place. But not much later, everything was back to normal."

 bronzehill_barnaby.3.d:0 "Genevieve Guildedwing stared at him, angrily. "What do you want from me? You took everything from me! What could you STILL want!?"\n\nBarnaby didn't answer immediately. He knew that he needed to choose his words carefully, or he would leave this meeting empty-pawed.\n\n"Skyfall stood against the Emperor, who I swore loyalty to. If I ever wanted to rebuild the Empire, Skyfall would need to go – and let's face it, any attempts of diplomacy here would have been a waste of time. But that doesn't mean that I couldn't see what was going on over there. You led a movement for reform, for equality, to give every creature a chance in life. And I admire your movement."\n\nThe griffon closed her eyes for a moment. "You admired it so much that you destroyed Skyfall, and my movement with it, taking me captive. Now you cite me before you, just to tell me that you admire me?"\n\n"I already explained why my paw was forced against Skyfall. But otherwise, no. I wanted to talk to you, because the Empire needs a movement like that as well." He sighed. "We have an election upcoming. It would be pretty boring if there was only one party, right?"\n\n"Fitting for the Empire, I would say."\n\nBarnaby giggled. "Considering the past, I would be inclined to agree. But I am here to bring change, and I want free elections. For that, I need a second party, with a leader that can give Copperhill a run for his money. Don't get me wrong, Copperhill is a good dog, and I learned a lot of him. But I believe that his vision for the Empire is quite conservative, and the griffons – and dogs – of the Empire should have the chance to elect more change. You are the griffon to deliver that. Of course, you would need to give your commitment to the monarchy. This is the price I'm asking of you."\n\nGuildedwing said nothing for a while. "I have no idea why I believe you. But I do. I have... Ok, fine! I will swear the oath and lead a party." She shook her head. "I just hope I won't regret this.""

 bronzehill_barnaby.4.t:0 "Choosing A Voting System"
 bronzehill_barnaby.4.d:0 "The constitutional committee was stuck. Again. While this wasn't something out of the ordinary, this time Barnaby could understand them. The question presented would possibly shape the future of the burgeoning democracy, namely, how the votes of the citizens would be translated into seats in parliament. Barnaby sat behind his desk and looked at the reports the administration had produced for him. Here, they discussed the two possible solutions, and how they would impact the party system in the future.\n\nThe first option was called "first-pass-the-post" or "majoritarian" system. The Empire would be divided into constituencies, and each constituency would elect one Member of Parliament. This would give the larger parties a big advantage, as all votes that weren't for the winner in this local constituency would essentially be wasted. As the report before him said, this could potentially lead to a concentration of votes between two major parties, with other parties being mostly forced to concentrate their efforts on a specific area, where they could hope to make a difference. While this would make it easier for a single party to reach a majority, this majority would not necessarily mean a majority of the popular vote, which could harm legitimacy. Also, his administration warned that local national parties could be overrepresented, if the major parties would split the loyalist vote between them.\n\nThe second option was called "proportional" system. Here, the votes for the parties were counted on a national level, and then seats assigned to them for every full 100.000 votes. This would give all parties equal changes for representation, regardless of their size. Yet, his administration warned him, this could lead to a splintering of the vote, making outright majorities unlikely and leading to coalition governments. While this would not necessarily be a bad thing, at some point it would lead to the potential of a stalled government, if party ideologies proved to be too incompatible.\n\nWith the constitutional committee undecided, it was on Barnaby to make the final call. His choice would shape the future of the party system – certainly not an easy decision to make."
 bronzehill_barnaby.4.a:0 "Let's make it majoritarian."

 bronzehill_barnaby.5.t:0 "A Socialist Roundtable"
 bronzehill_barnaby.5.d:0 "The atmosphere in the room was a little tense, however, by this point Barnaby was used to worse by the constitutional committee. Although he had to admit that the committee had cooled down lately... He straightened his back, trying to stay focused on what was before him.\n\nIndeed, it was kind of a comical situation. This was ostensibly, if not officially, the founding conference for the second large party of the upcoming elections – and here he was again, being arguably the one to get things started. At least, there had been some smaller movements sprung up without his involvement.\n\nGenevieve Guildedwing spoke first. "I welcome you all to this roundtable for the discussion on the future of socialism. I am glad that so many griffons and dogs could make it. I don't want to beat around the bush: It is my intention to found a party that can collect the various movements for equality and justice and provide the people of these lands with an option to elect progress. Nothing less should be our common goal."\n\nAfter Guildedwing, several other figures from Herzland spoke, including Georgine Schüler, Gerben Kogchel and Rosey Luxembark. Luxembark and Woofkin were the only two dogs in the room besides Barnaby himself, but in the ensuing discussion, they had an interesting role. As Barnaby had invited the two to the roundtable, he had mixed feelings. On the own paw, they would make the party stick to monarchism, and with Guildedwing at the helm, a little reassurance on this front would be valuable. On the other paw however, they surely would make the policies of the party to come more radical. This was the price to be paid.\n\nAfter several hours, the roundtable dissolved, and the results had been pretty good. The policy outlines had been agreed upon and the major positions in the party to come had been distributed. Two days later, the Socialist Party of the Griffonian Empire would officially be founded, with the first chairgriff and candidate for Prime Minister being Genevieve Guildedwing. The campaign season could start."

Most socialists and even the plurality of social harmonists were republican minded, and despite the best efforts of known monarcho-communists like Luxembark the left-wing vote still favoured republicanism.\n\nUnder pressure from the Imperial regency and some of its members, the Socialist Party has officially endorsed the monarchy. In reaction to that, the Free Workers Party of Griffonia has sprung up as official pro-republican alternative. Under heavy supervision from the Imperial government they cannot hope to truly rival the Socialist party, but they could coax away much needed votes."

 bronzehill_barnaby.13.t:0 "The Liberal Cause"
 bronzehill_barnaby.13.d:0 "The vast majority of the Imperial citizens are griffons, but other species are present as well in the Empire. Skyfall is a haven of many races, from ponies to the occasional zebra or minotaur, and of course Bronzehill itself is inhabited by diamond dogs. The various minority species of the Empire have founded the Liberal Griffonian Species Union to promote their common interest in stopping any pro-griffon discrimination. Yet, they have not utilized their full potential so far. Bronzehill's diamond dogs tend to favour the main parties, seeing themselves as honorary griffons anyway. But the liberal cause is on the rise – the question is only if they can get their message out to their votes in time."

 bronzehill_barnaby.15.t:0 "The Old And New Prime Minister"
 bronzehill_barnaby.15.d:0 "The old and new prime minister was sitting in his office, thinking about all that led to this moment. The first election was over, and the people had their first real chance of judging his government. Copperhill had given his best during the campaign, pointing to the many reforms and improvements his government had achieved. And it had worked – the people had given him their support. It was a special feeling for sure. During the race, he had seen moments were it looked like Genevieve would give him a run for his money.\n\nSinking into his chair, he thought about this hypothetical for a moment. Seeing her face before his inner eye made him uncomfortable. Yes, he had advocated for democracy for the majority of his life, but it sure wasn't always easy to handle. Governing the Empire was a challenge in on itself, but doing so while every minor decision was questioned by the press and the opposition was another level entirely. How many of his words had been twisted? This was the less lovely part about democracy. And yet, it had to be this way... Without a press, without opposition, there was no democracy to be made...\n\nEnough of that, Copperhill thought. He got up from his chair and made his way onto Barnaby's office. His formal appointment was a formality, but he would get a nice chat with the "young reformer" out of it. He had known the prince-turned-regent since Barnaby had been a little cub. So many things had happened since. And Barnaby had grown, not just as a character, but politically. For how long had Copperhill considered himself his mentor? But nowadays their roles felt all but reversed. With a calm voice, the regent would explain to him the matters of grand Imperial politics, giving insights from every source imaginable. If he wouldn't know better, he would envy Barnaby. But Copperhill had grown too old to be envious."

 bronzehill_barnaby.16.t:0 "A New Prime Minister"
 bronzehill_barnaby.16.d:0 "It had been an odd few days. The feeling was still unreal, she thought, sitting in the Imperial palace, in this office that Copperhill had occupied for so long. What now? The old dog had taken his defeat with grace, even had shown her around in the office and the connected rooms. His voice had clung a bit pressed, but she could hardly blame him for that. It had been a hard campaigning season for sure, for him not less than for her.\n\nBut here she was. In the end, the people had trusted her more than him. And to be fair, it did seem like Copperhill could promise little more than he had already done. The people elected change, and now it was time to bring that change to them. She would need to sort out her government first, however... Her socialist party was still a weird bundle of many ideologies and cliques. What was she to do with Rosey Luxembark? She could really hardly pass her up when distributing the ministerial posts, but that dog was seriously hard to work with. How could she both be so radical left and yet be an ardent monarchist? These diamond dogs from Bronzehill really were a special breed.\n\nAnd speaking of that, she would need to make her way to Barnaby's office, to officially get appointed. How much had happened since he had approached her first, about the offer to lead a social reformist movement? She still couldn't quite decide if his offer had been genuine or not, but so far he hadn't walked back on anything. After the election, there had been this little rest of doubt in her, if he would maybe deny her the office under some shady justification. But he had kept his word, for reasons she could only speculate about. Had it just been public pressure? The fear of the inevitable backlash? Or had he been fully sincere from the start?\n\nFrom now on, she would speak often with Barnaby, even more often than before. She would need to speak with him about her policy plans, or at least he would expect that. How much influence would he try to take? And how much influence was she willing to give him?"

 bronzehill_barnaby.17.t:0 "The Interfractional Committee"
 bronzehill_barnaby.17.d:0 "The room was already filled with griffons when Copperhill and [BRZ_barnaby_socialist_leader] arrived. To their surprise, the room did not look like one of the usual meeting rooms. Instead, it was filled with comfy chairs and small tables, more like what a club would look like. In the middle, there was a larger table, with an opulent chandelier above it. Barnaby welcomed the two warmly, and lead them to just that larger table.\n\nShortly afterwards, the other griffons in the room, representatives from all parties in parliament, also took their seats on the table. The regent had prepared little nameplates, but to the surprise of everyone the seats were not ordered by party.\n\n"Welcome, dear members of parliament, to this little meeting I have prepared. For quite a while now I had this idea that we should have a way to build some body for cross-party issues, and so this is what I want to present to you today. I have called it the 'Interfractional Committee', and I would propose this very room as meeting room."\n\nBarnaby paused for a moment, before he continued. "You might be asking why we need such a thing. All the parties have their ideas, and it is just a matter of whom the public entrusts with a mandate to govern which ideas will be put into action. But I believe that there is a danger in this approach, a danger which I have seen some other democracies make already. And that danger is division and polarisation. If some party dictates policy for some time, and then the next party comes into power, there might be incentive to just wipe everything the other party has done. But this is not how I want the government to work. We need to remember that we are, ultimately, one people and all work to make this country better. And for that, we need to listen to each other. This is what I want this committee to be about."\n\nThere was a moment of silence as the people in the room considered what Barnaby just said. But some griffon started to clap, and everyone in the room joined."

 bronzehill_barnaby.18.t:0 "How The Court Changes"
 bronzehill_barnaby.18.d:0 "Barnaby was sitting in his office, his desk filled with reports as always. Normally, he would be busy looking through them, and filtering out the relevant information. But today, he instead had lounged back in his chair, pondering about the Imperial court.\n\nSo many things had changed, and yet so much had also stayed the same. Griffenheim palace was still in many ways a city within city, and the political heart of the Empire. While the Imperial parliament had a building outside the palace, the Prime Minister's office was here, as where offices of the Verfassungsgericht, the supreme court of the Empire. And of course, the members of parliament who took part in the Interfractional Committee likewise met in the Imperial palace. The three branches of government where still tied to the palace, even if they were now independent of the Emperor to some extent.\n\nBut where they, really? How much time did he spend every day to ensure that emotions did not spill over? If his job was to replace the Emperor for a time, then the government was still far from being independent. Democracy at work... He let out sigh. The institutions would mature, eventually.\n\nIt knocked on his door, and a servant entered. "Your Highness? The MPs Martha Schönfeder and Laszlo Geldsack have sent me. They would require your advice in a delicate situation. As far as they told me, Geldsack claims that Schönfeder passed over him and the liberals in the discussion on the subsidies plan for Skyfallian businesses. And as the budget is now filled up, they claim that only you can settle the debate now."\n\nBarnaby got up from his chair and followed the servant. Another petty conflict to solve. He already had a quite concrete idea why Geldsack was so unhappy with the results. Perhaps there could be some government contracts to make him shut up. He tried to remember his previous thought. Where had he been? Oh right, about how institutions would mature someday. Well, evidently today was not that day."

 bronzehill_barnaby.19.t:0 "A Proposal From The Radicals"
 bronzehill_barnaby.19.d:0 ""It would need to be a fast operation. Announce the vote in parliament, push it through and have loyal police guards in place to isolate the palace. Only Barnaby could really stop us. The conservatives would protest the vote, no doubt, but Copperhill is an old dog. Without the regent behind his back, he cannot carry on. Many among the conservatives are republican as well. They would just replace him."\n\nTheodor Rädelsgreif, leader of the Free Workers Party, was sitting with Genevieve Guildedwing in a little café on the outskirts of Griffenheim. It had not been entirely clear for her why he had insisted to meet her here, but was quite clear to her now. While he tried to coat his plans in some legal framing, it was still not less than a coup, a coup to remove the monarchy and turn the Empire into a republic.\n\nAnd he had a point. The Imperial regent was always present. He read through every plan of her and gave his comment, not always to her liking. He had held the free election he had promised, but it was likewise clear that with only one word from him the whole charade could be ended and the Empire return to absolute rule. More so, how free could a government be called under these circumstances? And once Grover would be crowned, who would guarantee that the Emperor did not exactly do that and return to tyranny of his forefathers?\n\nThings would of course be much more complicated than the radical Theodor imagined. To have any legitimacy, and thus any chance of success, the vote in parliament would require broad support. To change the constitution, a two-thirds majority was required – while Theodor may thought that a simple vote would be just accepted as the "will of the people", more sway was needed. Luckily, some conservatives were indeed republicans at heart.\n\nThe two griffons continued to make some plans for another hour. In the end, they had come up with a plan. She would bring this up in a leader board of the socialist party, to have the party whip in place. The agrarians would be convinced easily enough. The last step would be to approach selected conservatives and liberals."

 bronzehill_barnaby.20.t:0 "Dark Clouds Gather"
 bronzehill_barnaby.20.d:0 "Luxembark panted a little bit as she arrived in Barnaby's office. The meeting of the Socialist Party's leadership had not even ended an hour ago, and she had run all the way to the Imperial palace. But what she had heard was enough to make this effort – Genevieve Guildedwing, the Prime Minister, wanted to declare a republic!\n\nThe Imperial regent granted her an audience, even without arranging it first. While their relationship was not exactly easy, he had a level of trust in her. "Welcome, Rosey. What grave matter brings you to me with such haste?"\n\n"Genevieve! I could not believe my ears – apparently, the radicals have approached her with a proposition to declare a republic. During the party leadership, she was sparse on details, whether that was due to my presence or not I have no clue. But I can only thank the stars that I even went there, as I only decided that this morning. I guess that threw her plans into disarray." Luxembark told him about planned vote.\n\n"How fun to hear the word 'radicals' from your muzzle." Barnaby chuckled. "But what you're saying is indeed of great importance. Maybe it was naïve of me to trust her... We will need to find a solution, and that soon. This vote must not happen." He straightened his back, and looked her into the eyes. "Thank you for this information. I will be open with you, Genevieve's plans never would have succeeded, for that I hold to many strings of power in my paws. She neither could control the army nor the bureaucracy. But what her plans could have accomplished is to destroy our new found democracy, because without prior notice, I would have needed to rely on the army to solve the ensuing crisis. Now, we still have time, and this gives us options. I need you to speak with select party board members from the Socialist party. Genevieve needs to be removed from office. I will secure smooth sailing on the palace side of things, but I would prefer to at least keep up the appearance for the processes within the Socialist Party."\n\nLuxembark nodded slowly. Barnaby took a sheet of paper and wrote down some names. She took the paper from his paw and slowly left his office."

 bronzehill_barnaby.21.t:0 "A Coup Prevented"
 bronzehill_barnaby.21.d:0 "Reality is often much more mundane than what one would expect. The citizens of the Empire did not notice the attempted coup, not even in Griffenheim. The newspapers brought headlines about Genevieve Guildedwing's removal as head of the Socialist Party and her resignation as Prime Minister. Official statements were left vague, only citing "internal party disagreements". Two days later, the Free Worker's Party of Griffonia announced their withdrawal from the coalition, however, continued support for the ruling coalition was guaranteed by agreements with former opposition parties, most notably the Agrarian Alliance. Two more days later, new headlines announced that Georgina Frederika Schüler was elected new head of the Socialist Party, and subsequently appointed Prime Minister by the Imperial regent.\n\nFar from the public eye, three people had sat in Barnaby's office, Rosey Luxembark, Genevieve Guildedwing and the Imperial regent himself. He looked at the former Prime Minister and said: "It's a pity that it had to end like this. I believed in you. But I guess, some convictions don't really change, now do they? Whether you like to hear it or not, this little episode is over, and no damage was done. While what you did was clearly treason – or attempted treason – I don't wish to bring this matter before the courts. Just promise me to refrain from any political action in the future. See it as... early retirement."\n\nGuildedwing looked back at him with pure hatred in her eyes. Barnaby, as if per chance, put his paw on a stack of papers. She followed his movement and squinted, but then slowly nodded. She had lost, utterly, and she knew it. Like in slow motion, she stood up and left his office.\n\nAnd so the two diamond dogs were left alone in the room. Luxembark finally broke the silence and sighed. "Well, this was an interesting episode for sure. Do you remember the old days, back in Bronzekreuz, when we met without the knowledge of your father? I cannot help to feel reminded of this." She paused for a moment, to linger in thoughts. "Tell me of Grover. How is he doing? Does he accept your vision for the Empire?""

The Bronzekreuzer Bote was truly the best in these times – war and destruction had become the new norm, but the Bote understood it to also bring good news to lighten the mood. And so, each morning after breakfast, it had become a routine for him to delve into the reading.\n\nThis morning, the editorial was titled "The Dream of Pan-Griffonian Democracy". In it, the author claimed that as recent developments had shown, the Empire was now the only reasonable contender to bring a pan-griffonian democracy, were every griffon or dog would be accepted regardless of their heritage or culture. She also extensively covered the shenanigans of late Alexander Kemerskai, who had promised to build such a democracy for a long time, but, according to the author, had failed the griffons under his command. Furthermore, so was stated in the article, the republic was always a failed project, because it was built on the treason of 978, which would have poisoned every freedom which would have come out of it. As conclusion, the author claimed that it could only have been internal reform in the Empire, which could have brought true freedom, and only due to the hard work of the Imperial regent this had finally become a reality.\n\nUsually, Woofrey commented on the articles while he was reading, but not today. Barkah, his wife, eventually came over and asked: "Why are you so quiet today? Did something grave happen?"\n\n"No", Woofrey answered: "but I can't quite make my mind up if the author here is right. She says that the Empire now holds up the dream of pan-griffonian democracy. We had this election, alright, and you could reasonably say that our Prime Minister is now democratically elected, but I wonder if she makes too big of a deal out of it. After all, it's still our Emperor who protects us, right? I hope these deal brokers in Griffenheim don't go too far, because I fear what would happen if they decide to side-line the Emperor. Wouldn't that bring us back to 978 all over again, even if not with violence? I think we need our most noble Grovers. When I go to buy my newspaper every day, I see a whole slew of different headlines, even if they cover the same event. Nodog can tell me that you should build a government with that."

 bronzehill_barnaby.23.d:0 "It was one of the rare occasions where Luxembark really enjoyed her government position. Being minister of work and social security under [BRZ_barnaby_socialist_leader] was not always easy, and too many of her policy proposals had been rebuffed. While the Prime Minister said that she wanted social equality, in reality she was still scared to take the radical steps necessary to achieve that. But today, she got to meet with trade unionists from all over the Empire. As minister, she was responsible for keeping up relation with the trade unions, and so holding a little congress could bring valuable input. Well, neither [BRZ_barnaby_socialist_leader] nor the Imperial regent had sounded entirely convinced of her idea, but at least, this time they hadn't stopped her.\n\nThe congress hall was already filled with griffons. Some of them she recognized, even from her old years back of the university. She could see Karl Legreif standing by a table, talking to a griffon she never saw before. As she went to greet her old acquaintance, the other griffon, whose feathers were coloured in a deep red, walked up to her.\n\n"Rosey Luxembark! Our minister! How nice to meet you. I'm Werner Rotflügel, from the Griffenheimer Union of Monarcho-Communists. I was just discussing with comrade Legreif over here, who said he knows you since over twenty years. I've read your articles, and also those of your friend Woofkin, and they have convinced me to join your cause. As I was just trying to tell comrade Legreif, true communism needs a monarch, but he seems to be an ardent republican."\n\nThe griffon looked at her expectantly, but she was not entirely sure what to make of this introduction. After a moment of confusing, she tried to play things safe. "Welcome to this congress, comrade Rotflügel. I'm happy to hear that you like my works, and also those of my dear friend Woofkin. I believe the issue of republicanism should not be dividing us anymore. The reforms we made and the reforms we still plan to make should make it clear that the monarchy is not an obstacle to social justice, as some writers might claim. But it would likewise be foolish to rely on the monarchy to bring it to us, we need to put in this effort ourselves. And that's one of the prime reasons I have called this convention.""

 bronzehill_barnaby.24.d_guildedwing:0 "Genevieve Guildedwing sat in her office, contemplating the time since her appointment as Prime Minister. Had she delivered the change she had promised? Well, some even in her own cabinet would say that she didn't. This annoying dog Luxembark always came to her with one radical proposal after the next. But in her own mind, she had fulfilled what she had planned to do, as any more intervention in the economy could prove dangerous. She never had been against the idea of an economy build on private companies, even though some of her party members absolutely were.\n\nBut she was still proud on what she had accomplished. She could claim to have made real progress. The inequality in the empire was declining, and even simple workers could feel the improvements in living standards. Multiple government programs had been a huge success, whether talking about the public housing, the Fair Land Act or the Parental Support Act. And then of course the Worker's Rights Act... one of the first laws passed after the government started its reform program.\n\nAnd she even had to admit, that Barnaby had played some role in that. His ability to find the right words at the right time was truly unmatched... Perhaps it was time to let old grudges go.  He had conquered her old home of Skyfall, but he put something in his place that maybe could replace it. Wasn't it strange how even whole countries could change? The Griffonian Empire as haven of liberty – unthinkable even just a decade ago.\n\nNow, it was time to let the political scene rest for bit. Until the next election, where the citizens would come to choose again between two visions for the Empire."
 bronzehill_barnaby.24.d_schueler:0 "Georgina Schüler sat in her office, contemplating the time since she became Prime Minister, and even before. She had started out just as economic minister, but then Guildedwing tried to uproot the monarchy. Her start into her new role really hadn't been all that smooth, and she would have liked to have fresh elections to gain a new mandate for her government. Yet, Barnaby had been adamant about this: Fresh elections would blow up the affair even further, and that run contrary to what he was trying to do, or so he claimed.\n\nWell, so she had continued Guildedwing's mandate. At least, she could claim to have made real progress. The inequality in the empire was declining, and even simple workers could feel the improvements in living standards. Multiple government programs had been a huge success, whether talking about the public housing, the Fair Land Act or the Parental Support Act. And then of course the Worker's Rights Act... one of the first laws passed after the government started its reform program.\n\nIn all of that, the Imperial regent had also played a crucial role. It might be hard to admit, but transitioning an Empire so used to autocratic rule to a full democracy might have required the same amount of work – if not even more – than to actually run it as an autocracy. He had been a real asset in making sure that the effects of the more impactful laws didn't boil over in the circles of aristocrats or industrialists. He was quite well at convincing people, he really was...\n\nBut now, the party program had been pretty much fulfilled, and it was time to let the constant stream of political reform rest – at least until the next election would grand a new mandate, to a new government."

The griffons of the Empire had elected him to continue his service to the nation, and he had made his best effort to ensure that the country would stand strong and united. The best and brightest could achieve every more marvellous feats of technology, the army could rest assured knowing that the government would support them and crime and corruption, rooted deep in the centuries of absolutism, were tackled by a empowered police.\n\nIn all of that, Barnaby had played a crucial role. The old dog was swept over by warm feeling. The Imperial regent had proven such skill in political matters, more than he himself ever could claim to have processed. He could feel his age in his bones, and although his mind was still sharp, there was little doubt that the young dog had simply much more energy than him. With incredible tactfulness Barnaby had constructed a stable democratic system, convincing the old powerbrokers to go along with it and even raising the young Emperor to responsible constitutionalism.\n\nHe opened his eyes again to stare once more on the reports on his desk.

"Next week, I have a trip planned to visit some cities across the Empire, and I was wondering if you would be willing to come along. I think sitting in this palace gets boring over time, so maybe you want a bit of fresh air around your beak?"\n\nGrover accepted, and so, one week later Barnaby and he were on their way to Crona, where their first station would be. Grover was surprised that his regent drove the car himself, but the dog had given him a smile and said that even as Count – or Emperor – it was good to be able to do some things yourself, before inviting him to sit pillion besides him. Of course, the view was not as good as Grover had hoped, as they had several cars of the Imperial guard before, besides and behind them, but he still felt that this was a fun adventure.\n\nWhen they arrived in Crona, Barnaby led him to the town hall. It was not as impressive as the one in Griffenheim, but Grover figured that Crona was just a much smaller town. They were greeted by the mayor, an imposing griffon with blue fur and feathers. "Welcome, your majesty, to Crona! What a time that I get to see our great Emperor. I hope the travel went without troubles? Come on inside! And of course also welcome to our regent." He turned to Barnaby. "Your highness, I am overjoyed that you honour our city with your visit." He looked to Grover again. "Both of you, I mean. Now, then let me show you our achievements here."\n\nGrover and Barnaby followed the mayor inside. His regent had told him the name, but Grover had forgotten again. More importantly however, Barnaby had also told him that the mayor had only been elected not too long ago, and with support of the socialists. It was surprising to Grover to now see how much the mayor seemed to be delighted about a visit from his Emperor. Weren't socialists the ones who wanted him gone in favour of a republic? He decided to go ahead and just ask about this.\n\nThe mayor laughed a deep laugh and told him: "Well, your majesty, I'm not that kind of socialist. I just want to a better life for all, and I support whoever makes it happen. Under your father that was indeed difficult, but now? No reason for republic, as I see it.""

 bronzehill_barnabygrover.2.d:0 "Grover had just finished his last lecture. He had learned all about Grover III and the many laws that traced back to him. His head was spinning as he tried to keep all the dates in mind. As his teacher has told him, 'laws are what makes a nation – Grover II might have forged the Empire with iron and blood, but Grover III has glued it together by giving it the Imperial code'. He thought about this statement a bit more. Maybe the dates weren't the important thing to learn here. Rather, he decided, he would read more about the type of laws that Grover III had created, and how they had impacted the Empire at large.\n\nOn his way back to his personal chambers, he saw a griffoness dressed in a suit seemingly on the way to Barnaby's office. He didn't recognize her, and while this was somewhat normal, he decided he would ask her why she was here. After all, this was his palace, wasn't it?\n\nThe griffoness seemed surprised and also somewhat unsure when he asked her. "Your majesty, I'm an undersecretary in the ministry of finance. And I need the regent's opinion on the tax code changes that the cabinet is planning." Upon his look, she continued in a bit of distress. "We are planning on reducing the stamp duty for small land purchases. This is likely to cost the Imperial treasury about 230 million idols per year, considering current rates. And... I mean, may I ask why you are interested in this?"\n\n"Oh, I just had a lecture on Grover III. He did a lot of law codes, right? So, I figured that the laws are quite important. And so I should take interest, as Emperor?" His voice was not entirely sure.\n\n"I see. Yes, your majesty, laws are indeed very important for a nation. Ehm... I have to go now, otherwise your regent will be waiting for me. But maybe you want to come with me?" Grover nodded.\n\nWhen they both arrived at Barnaby's office, the dog was visibly surprised to see the Emperor, but said nothing. And so Grover attended the meeting. He was not sure if it was interesting or just boring. But there were surely a lot of numbers, and it all seemed important indeed."

The Emperor had been a fan of tanks since a few years, and he had asked his regent again and again and again if he could drive around in one. Was it becoming of an Emperor to drive around in tanks? Probably not, Barnaby thought. But on the other paw, he was still a child. He would grow out of it eventually.\n\nGrover had none of these concerns. As they arrived on the military test field near Helheim, he sprung out of the car and flew up in the air to look out for the tanks. "Hey!" a loud voice shouted below him. "No flying in the military area!" Grover landed again and almost bumped into a very strict looking officer. However, as the officer saw the Emperor, his strict gaze softened. "Ah, your majesty. Hadn't recognized you. But really, please do not fly up in this area, it's dangerous. We have air defence systems all over the place."\n\nBy now, Barnaby also arrived. Grover hadn't even noticed how far he had flown – in the air, the distances seemed always shorter. "My Emperor, please do not just fly away." panted the dog. "I know you are all excited and such, but still, I would prefer it if you would stay near me." Barnaby turned to the officer. "Colonel von Butterberg? We are here for the Emperor to try out a tank." The officer saluted and led them to the tank crew.\n\nGrover was now greeted by Thomas Stifftail and his crew, standing before a very heavy tank. "I'm Thomas, the tank commander. Here we have Marcus the gunner, Julia the loader and Lisa the radio operator. Ready for the tour? Then follow me inside."\n\nGrover and the four crawled into the beast of a tank. Here, Thomas explained him how the pedals worked and how to look out for where he was driving. Grover felt the tank shaking and jerking as they drove over the grassland, and everything was quite crammed. He suddenly wasn't all that envious anymore of the soldiers who had to drive these into battle. As Marcus fired a shot, the whole tank vibrated. It was cool for a tour, but driving every day was a different story."

 bronzehill_barnabygrover.4.t:0 "Of Leading An Empire"
 bronzehill_barnabygrover.4.d:0 "Something about this didn't feel right. Grover sat over his books and read the stories about how his ancestors build the Empire. And if there was one common theme, then that decisive action and clear leadership had been the dominant factor in how the Empire was built. But for him, there would neither be decisive action nor clear leadership. No, he would be bound by a constitution and a parliament. A most uncomfortable thought came to his head: Was Barnaby not as loyal to him as he had thought? Had his regent given away the chance for him to rule properly? But Grover liked Barnaby. The dog was always friendly to him, and really seemed to only ever have the best intention for him in mind. Maybe it was time to just ask his regent about this, and then he could still decide what to do.\n\nThis evening, he confronted Barnaby why he had bound him by constitution. His regent seemed shaken by his Emperor's accusation, even as he tried not to show it. "You see, my Emperor, what you have read in your history books is certainly true. A good Emperor can lead an Empire to greatness – although we should not forget the cost paid in the struggles of Grover II. But your history books also cover Grover IV, your grandfather, and Grover V, your dear father. Have you read of them? Because there is another side of the story. Why did the Empire collapse?"\n\n"It collapsed because the traitors in Wingbardy and Aquileia seceded. And then revolution came and ravaged the Empire, or what was left it."\n\n"Yes, my Emperor. But there is a sour truth in the collapse. Just as a great emperor can forge a continent-spanning empire, under such an autocratic leadership, a bad emperor can lead to its downfall. Boreas may forgive me, but there is no gain in hiding the truth – both your grandfather and your father had not the capacity to hold the Empire together by themselves. This is the other side of the idol, just as much of a consequence of autocracy as enabling a great emperor."\n\n"And you don't trust me to hold the Empire together either?"\n\n"If it was only about that, I would give you all the power. But we need to think beyond ourselves. What I am doing is building institutions, institutions that can hold the Empire together. At some point, we will have another Grover V, but the Empire will endure, for it doesn't hinge anymore on the willpower of a single griffon.""

 bronzehill_barnabygrover.5.d:0 "Grover laid on his bed, the wings folded like a like a blanket over his body. His beak was pressed into his pillow and he thumped his tail restlessly against the edge of the bed. He had to think about a most difficult problem, and he just couldn't come to a conclusion.\n\nThe facts of the problem were very simple: He had met the daughter of a politician today, and he had liked her voice a lot. Her stature had been very graceful and her feathers had a beautiful violet. With a bit of trickery, he had found some minutes to speak to her alone and to his delight, she seemed exited to meet the Emperor. The spontaneous tête-à-tête had been cut short by his duties – Barnaby had demanded he should take part in a dinner – but in the time afterwards, he had barely noticed his surroundings.\n\nThis had been some hours ago, and since then, the world had made itself known again in his mind, and with it, some doubts. Barnaby had told him long ago, that as Emperor, he had to think about others as much as himself, that his position was one of privilege, but also duty. But what was the duty in such a case?\n\nPart of him wanted to just sweep aside these thoughts. After all, why shouldn't he be allowed to seek companionship of a griffoness? He would need to marry eventually, and surely he should marry someone he liked. Had his ancestors ...no, probably not. It felt like a cold shower, but whenever his history books discussed marriages, they analysed the political implications, not the personal ones. For a moment, he hated his crown more than anything in the world. He took a deep breath. How many boys his age were sad about their favourite girl not liking them? And here he was, being sad about the opposite."

 bronzehill_barnabygrover.6.t:0 "A Meeting With The Prime Minister"
 bronzehill_barnabygrover.6.d_copperhill:0 "Grover opened the door to the Prime Minister's office. Honestly, despite Copperhill having an office in the Imperial palace, Grover didn't often speak to him. Actually, he might only have spoken to his Prime Minister a couple of times in all these years. How old was the dog now? He had to be over 70. He had fought in the revolution, as far as he could remember. And he had been a big influence for Barnaby. But was he still?\n\nHe was greeted by a warm, deep voice. "Welcome, my Emperor. Your regent has taken the liberty to arrange this little meeting. I don't think we have spoken often, but of course Barnaby and I speak every week, and often more than that. In the future, once you are crowned, you will be the one to speak to your Prime Minister, although I don't think it will be me for much longer. I can feel my bones getting old." Copperhill sighed.\n\n"What do you talk about with Barnaby?"\n\n"How the government goes. What we have planned in the cabinet, the position of ministers on different issues, just anything that happens politically. Barnaby knows a lot about the Empire, and I admire him for that. He has a lot of energy. If we have a political stalemate, he usually knows what to do. Sometimes he comes to cabinet meetings, particularly if there are controversial topics. As an outsider, you know? Offering a neutral voice on the matter. But he does more than that, because he also knows all of the opposition leaders. And he talks to them too, if not in such an official manner."\n\n"But you are the Prime Minister. I have read the constitution, and from that I've learned that you are responsible for leading the cabinet and making the decisions?"\n\n"I am. But as I said, Barnaby knows a lot. You know, politics tends to get quite partisan at times, and in these situations a mediator can solve a lot of problems before they even arise officially. Of course, he is also well respected. That counts for more than one would think."\n\nThe conversation continued for a while. As Grover left Copperhill's office, he pondered about what the old dog had said. Barnaby had grown beyond the Prime Minister, so much was for certain. And his role seemed much more than what just was in the constitution."
 bronzehill_barnabygrover.6.d_guildedwing:0 "Grover opened the door to the Prime Minister's office. He knew a bit about Genevieve Guildedwing, but he had hardly ever spoken to her. She had her office in the Imperial palace, but their paths didn't cross too often. It was a large palace. But he knew that she had been in Skyfall – she was the niece of the "Iron Chancellor" Guichard, who had mocked his father for so long. But now she was here, serving the Empire. Life was strange. What did she think of him, really?\n\nHe found her sitting behind her desk. "Welcome, Emperor Grover. I think it is the first time you visit me in my office – your regent was kind enough to arrange this little meeting." She directed Grover in a comfortable chair, taking the other one for herself. "I guess it will be good training for you. Barnaby and I speak often, at least once a week. As Emperor, you will have to speak to the Prime Minister – whether me or somegriff else."\n\n"What do you speak about with Barnaby?"\n\n"Everything that's going on in politics, I would say. The laws and edicts we have planned in the cabinet, and of course the input from the administration. We also discuss the news stories. And Barnaby can offer advice on these things. He knows a lot and has a lot of energy – and a lot of friends. There can be little doubt that he is the one with the most contacts among politicians. He gets a lot of information, from many sources. I have learned to come to trust his advice."\n\n"Can I ask you a personal question? You come from Skyfall, from the treasonous republic. What made you consider working for the Empire, to be its Prime Minister even?"\n\nShe closed her eyes for a moment. "Life is not always easy on us. Many things we hold dear can get destroyed. You called Skyfall a treasonous republic. Treasonous to whom? To your father? The Empire was not a force for good under him. But in life, there are also opportunities, opportunities to work for your ideals. The Empire is not the same anymore. If you had asked me ten years ago if I would sit in the Imperial palace and work chat with the Emperor, I would have laughed you out of the room. But things can change. And I think it had a lot to do with Barnaby. He is not always easy, but you are lucky to have such a regent."\n\nThey continued to talk, and Grover got the feeling that it was Barnaby more than anything else who kept the government running so smooth. As he left, he wondered what this would mean for him, later. And he still couldn't say if she liked him or not."
 bronzehill_barnabygrover.6.d_schueler:0 "Grover opened the door to the Prime Minister's office. What did he know of Georgine Schüler? She had led a pro-democratic movement in Yale, and later she had joined the Socialist Party. And then there had been a big trouble with the former Prime Minister Guildedwing, who wanted to overthrow him. And Schüler had replaced her. But despite that she had her office in the Imperial Palace for years, he had barely talked to her.\n\nAs he entered, she stood up from her seat to greet him. "Your majesty, welcome to my office. I am happy that your regent could arrange this little meeting. We have barely spoken, despite me living in your palace for so long, no? But later you will have to speak to your Prime Minister regularly, just as I speak now with Barnaby. And we speak often, I would say, more than once per week. From proposals in the cabinet to the latest news stories, everything I do the regent also knows – often before the act."\n\n"And do you listen to him?"\n\nShe smiled. "It is not that he dictates me my policies. Your regent is smart, your majesty, and he knows everything that goes on in the Empire. We more... hold a conversation. Exchange opinions. But he is very good at predicting the outcomes of political actions. Everything you do has consequences, you know? He knows those consequences." She paused for a bit. "You might say that I listen to him, yes. He hold great respect, and he gets information that nogriff would ever get. I think it has much to do with that he truly has the role as middleman. As the honest arbitrator. It is not an easy role to play."\n\n"Do you think I can play the same role as Emperor?"\n\n"I would think so. But it needs hard work. Barnaby has a lot of energy. You need to talk to everyone, every party, every politician and even many outside of the palace. But yes, I would hope you take your regent as example."\n\nThey continued to talk, and she gave him some examples of how Barnaby took on his delicate job. Grover thought about the constitution and how he had analysed it for his lectures. Reality was always more complicated."

 bronzehill_barnabygrover.7.t:0 "The Task Of The Emperor"
 bronzehill_barnabygrover.7.d:0 "Grover enjoyed a quiet moment, wandering through the gallery of his ancestors. It would be a little less than a year before he would be crowned. He trusted his regent – Barnaby would not betray him. He could sense that even the energetic dog slowly ran out of energy. And then, the duty would fall onto him. But what would this duty be?\n\nHe looked on the portrait of Grover I, wielding the Idol of Boreas. He saw a strong, charismatic griffon, willing to forge an Empire. Next to him, Grover II, in shining armour, conquering the east. Strong and determined. The picture didn't tell the story of how the eastern crusade ended. But Grover knew, from history books and from his regent. It rung in his ear. 'We should not forget the cost paid in the struggles of Grover II.', Barnaby had said to him. Grover stared at these two griffons, as if he expected an answer to a question he could not quite formulate.\n\nThe path of these two Emperors was beyond his reach. He would not be portrait in shining armour. Instead, he would wear a formal dress with necktie. Maybe a military uniform, but nothing more. Another thing Barnaby had said to him came to his mind. 'Just as a great emperor can forge an empire, a bad emperor can lead to his downfall.' And: 'I am building institutions that can hold the Empire together.' What was his role in this?\n\nGrover had seen and learned a lot growing up. And he had come to the conclusion that Barnaby was right in building those institutions. But there was more to it – as much as Barnaby might claim it, the Empire could still not function without the Emperor. The institutions needed time to grow. If Barnaby and he were to vanish right now, they would collapse. Perhaps, this should be his goal as Emperor. To nurture these institutions, and to protect them. His regent had overseen their creation, and had reforged the Empire, often by force. His job would it be the Emperor of peace, of keeping things steady, until one day, they would function on their own, and he would take a less active role. But there was still a million idol question: What was the right approach in nurturing the institutions? He would need to decide that, sooner or later."

 bronzehill_barnabypostcoronation.1.d:0 "It had been Grover's first meeting of the interfractional committee after becoming Emperor. As he returned to his room, he thought about what he expected, and how it had turned out.\n\nDuring the regency, Barnaby had taking him to the meetings a couple times, especially in the time before his coronation. His regent – well, his former regent, he corrected himself – had tried to show him how the committee worked and how he should settle conflicts between the parties. But to stand there alone had still been a different experience altogether. He could feel the different attitudes of MPs towards him, some friendly, some disinterested and some quite hostile as well. He had to once more understand that not every griffon in his Empire liked him.\n\nPerhaps this was understandable. During his studies, he had learned a lot about his forefathers, and they had no doubt done great injustice. The Griffonian Empire might have brought peace to the warring griffons, but it had also meant the subjugation of what had once been independent kingdoms and cultures. And then everything had collapsed in 978 – and while the Empire was now rebuilt, it had once more been with iron and blood.\n\nBut there had also been a lot of positive reactions. During the meeting, it had dawned on Grover just how much Barnaby had worked to keep the parties in good spirit, and now they expected him to pull of the same. It would take time for him to get up to the quality his regent had achieved. But it was possible.\n\nBack in his rooms, Grover started to read reports from his administration. If he wanted to fill in the role that his loyal dog had for so long, he would need all the information he could get. He would also need to speak more to the representatives of the parties. While he already had some meetings with his Prime Minister, this could only be the beginning."

 bronzehill_grover_coronation.2.d:0 "It was a most beautiful day in Griffenheim. The sky was as clear as it could be, shining in the a thrilling azure, while the temperature was of this kind that was neither to hot nor to cold, but inviting you to spend the day outside. This of course was not by accident, but the result of careful preparation, for which a group of pegasi ponies had received a small fortune to make it happen.\n\nThe Grand Temple of Boreas, one of the most magnificent buildings in the centre of Griffenheim, had been prepared for this day for the better part of a year. It was shining in white marble, polished so perfectly that looking on its colour could blind the eye. The interior of the temple had been rearranged to make space for the thousands of guests that arrived for the coronation. The guests inside the temple were mostly nobles, although some businessgriffs had acquired an invitation for an unspeakable amount of money, and majority were griffons, with some dogs in between, but there were also a few ponies, probably from Aquileia, who had found their way to Griffenheim.\n\nWhile the inside of the temple was already crammed with people, the outside was madness. Griffons had arrived from every corner of the empire for a chance to see their sovereign, and while large places in front of the temple had been prepared, this was not nearly enough. The entire city of Griffenheim, despite already having millions of inhabitants, seemed to have doubled its population. Some griffons also tried to fly up for better view, causing the air to buzz with the beat of a thousand wings.\n\nAs expected from an emperor, Grover arrived late. Dressed in magnificent robes, he flew from Griffenheim palace over to the temple, followed by the eyes of thousands, and landed elegantly before the Archon of Boreas. He gracefully turned to the guests in the temple, as the Archon made an offering to Boreas, before turning back, for the Archon to put the Reichskrone (Imperial Crown) on his head and to give him the Reichsapfel (Imperial Orb) and sceptre in his left and right claw. Standing upright on his hind paws, he once more turned to the crowed, which cheered:"

The only people they could not interview were the people actually concerned with the coronation, as the palace had been tight-beaked about the whole affair.\n\nHowever, at long last, the wait was over. Griffenheim had swollen to over double the normal population due to the millions of griffons visiting for the coronation, and even in cities like Crona and Helheim there was not a single free bed left in the hotels. In preparation for the expected masses of griffons (and dogs and ponies), large squares had been prepared wherever possible. Grover's flight-route from his palace to the Grand Temple of Boreas had been pre-planned, so that he could be seen from every one of them, to at least distribute the masses of griffons.\n\nAnd finally, he came. Starting from Griffenheim palace, dressed in exquisite royal robes and flanked by the royal guard, Grover flew the predetermined route over the heads of the millions of his subjects, before landing in the Grand Temple of Boreas, where the final ceremony was to be held. The temple itself was filled by all sorts of griffons. Some of them were nobles, some others were businessgriffs and even others were journalists from the most read newspapers all over Griffonia. After the Emperor had landed, the Archon of Boreas prepared an offering to the gods. Then, at long last, he put the Reichskrone (Imperial Crown) on Grover's head, the Reichsapfel (Imperial Orb) in his left claw and the sceptre in his right.

 bronzehill_revenge.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius had struggled to keep it together for weeks now, ever since the news of the Emperor's death had torn his world apart. He sat listlessly behind his desk, shuffling papers back and forth when the messenger came storming in through the door, a telegram in his paw, gasping for breath as if he had ran all the way from Griffenheim.\n\n"Sir... sir..." he panted, holding out the Telegram. "News from Griffenheim... someone... someone...", he couldn't say more, and Ignatius slowly took the letter, staring at the short message. He blinked, unable to understand the words at first. He read it over and over, as if it was written in a different language, but soon the paper fell from his paw. A... a coup? And the crown prince had been...\n\nHe rose onto unsteady paws, stumbling away from his desk. It couldn't be, that letter had to be wrong... it couldn't be! Not that too! Not that too! He screamed, howling in despair as he slammed his paws against the wall, pounding it furiously as he slowly sank down to his knees, whining incoherently. He didn't even comprehend what was going on as two guards came into the room, pulling him away from the wall as he kept slamming his now bleeding paws into it, nor could he understand them when they tried to reach through to him.\n\nIn the end, Count Ignatius was dragged out of his office and brought to the hospital, even as the news spread from the palace to the city, and from the city to the country. Not enough that the emperor was dead, someone had murdered his son as well. The lineage of Grover, their saviour, was gone, it had been snuffed out, and in its place the military had taken control over Griffenheim."

The end of the Grover lineage had taken his will to live, and on the fifth day after the news from Griffenheim arrived, his heart beat no longer.\n\nBarnaby stood before the deathbed of his father, failing to find words for his feelings. The madgriff in Griffenheim had taken everything from him: not only his emperor and his father, but his ideals as well. What use were empty slogans about Harmony in this cruel world? How could any griff be trusted with political power if they had murdered their emperor, their own spiritual embodiment? Questions like these flew through his head as he looked upon his father.\n\nBut there was something new that grew in Barnabys stomach, something that had not been there before: some kind of stoic resolve. His father had taken the easy way out, to be united with his emperor in Boreas wings, but somebody would need to stay and take care of the worldly matters. This injustice could not stand, and he was called by fate itself to rectify it.\n\nWhile Barnaby stood on his fathers deathbed, word had spread to the Dogs of Bronzehill.

However, Barnaby decided to ignore this tradition.\n\nOf what use would the old nobledogs be? They were indecisive, weak, and only clung to their old privileges. This was not what Bronzehill needed. In a crisis like this, action was required, as well as unity, something that the nobledogs didn't seem to understand.\n\nIn this light, Barnaby had decided to convene an entirely different sort of council: The Council of Six. The six members would be himself, Winston Copperhill, Rufus Loudbark, Lassie Goldcoat, Rosey Luxembark, and Kimball Barking-Sun. To even attempt to bring these dogs into one room was highly unorthodox, and in different times something like this would have fallen apart within mere minutes. These times were far from normal, however. The dogs in this council of six were the dogs that commanded respect from many different parts of society, and they were also the dogs that had called for action.\n\nAs the first meeting started, it seemed like tension would flare up quickly, but as Barnaby declared that they had a common obligation to bring death to the traitors in Griffenheim, the suspicion and rivalry on the dogs' faces disappeared. Only one emotion remained: the desire for revenge."

Dawnclaw had turned it into a fortress, but the dogs were not to be stopped by anything, bringing heavy artillery to shell anything in their path. The morale of the soldiers defending the city broke before the dogs had reached the Imperial Palace, likely in part due to the dogs having a policy of no quarter towards the followers of the "Lord Protector".\n\nAs the armies of the dogs stormed into the palace they were disappointed to find only the dead body of Ferdinand Dawnclaw, but this did not stop them from taking revenge. The dead body was shredded into mincemeat, before being brought out of the city into the woods and fed to the wild animals therein. Nothing of the body would remain, not even the blood stained into the clothes he died in.\n\nEven as the fighting had stopped, units of dogs patrolled through the streets to search for former supporters of the traitor. Anygriff suspected of having supported the previous government was executed, often in gruesome ways, as the dogs indulged their thirst for revenge."

There was nodding among the other members of the council.\n\n"Then so it shall be. I wish I could feel grateful for this great task, but I feel as empty as the throne is. Still, I will try to do my tasks as regent dutiful and together with this council. Besides that, I would propose that the council will be written in law to consist of the sitting count as well as chairman and deputy of the three parties, the Harmonic-Conservatives, the National Union, and the Socialist Party. Other parties are not needed, as we need no griffon nonsense. \n\n"Such nonsense brings me to my next point: the griffons can not be trusted with their own self interest, that much is evident. I do not know what causes them to be so emotional and self sabotaging, but we must control them. As such it is my belief that we must enact a set of laws to keep them protected, and out of any positions where they can cause further harm. No griffon should hold political office beyond an advisory position, nor should they be able to become military officers. Were it not for the valliant griffon volunteers in the Bronzehill army I'd say they should be barred from military service whatsoever, but at very least they should be exempt from any drafting. Finally, while we can not restore the Empire for Grover's sake anymore, we can liberate the griffons from their own incompetence. I hate war as much as any Bronzehill dog, but to not act is to invite yet more disaster into the world."\n\nThe other members of the council shared an uneasy look, but their faces slowly grew firm as they nodded in agreement."

 bronzehill_revenge.99.d:0 "Another day went by at the Imperial court in Griffenheim. Things had calmed down from the years prior. Griffons buzzed around the court, some of the nobles, some businessgriffs, others simply workers and trade unionist.\n\nThe great throne room in Griffenheim was cast in dim light by the chandaliers hanging form the ceiling. A long velvet carpet led towards the great throne of the Griffonian Empire - but this throne was empty. Besides the throne stood a simple wooden chair, with a dog in simple cloth sitting on it. From looking at him, there was no mark that this dog held any great post in the court. Yet all the visitors of the court spoke to him in a low, serious voice, and he answered them in a similar tone. On first glance, the dog looked old, but if you observed him closer, you could see that his age was little over thirty, if even that. But his attitude was the embodiment of wisedom, paired with a sense of a dog tested by fate.\n\nThe dog on the wooden chair was Barnaby, regent of an empire without an emperor. When the dogs in the Council discussed, Barnaby barely listened, only intervening when they seemed to be unable to reach a conclusion. But Barnaby would serve his emperor, even though said emperor was dead. And after him, his son would serve as regent, then his grandson, great-grandson and so on. But never, ever would any dog claim the title of emperor. They were the emperors best friends, and they knew their place.\n\n§GThank you for playing the Bronzehill Submod!

It was hollow and undeserving, and the dogs had set about their labours with fervour and efficiency, tearing down city block after city block. Residential areas, government buildings, noble palaces, even temples. It mattered not what stood in their path: all would be torn down to make way for the only thing that the dogs could actually give to the Emperor: a dignified resting place.\n\nMany griffons protested, some even tried to defend their estates, but the dogs were not willing to play games with these and drove them out by violence if threats did not suffice. Griffenheim was already sullied with the death of the Emperor, and they would not allow its selfish citizens to further dishonour the emperor."

 bronzehill_tomb.2.d:0 "Despite the grief and anger felt by all dogs alike, the location for the Mausoleum has been chosen. It is only natural that his Majesty deserves only the best. It is the last thing that could be done to enshrine his memory. The best architects were asked to spearhead this colossal project. Many designs had been submitted but finally, after many days of searching, we have found the only design suitable for the place of his Majesty's final rest.\nThe final design showed large, square-like building. With three floors in total, each smaller than the previous, in size. Each level could be made from nothing less than a shiniest white marble. On top of the third and last floor was a spherical roof with a statue of his Majesty on top. Overall stairs-like appearance were to symbolize his Majesty's journey to the heavens and the spherical roof symbolises the paradise where Boreas and his ancestors await him. White marble symbolises his Majesty's purity and innocence.\nThe insides of the mausoleum were divided into three parts. First, the area dedicated to the visitors, divided from the next area by a wall. From there, the stairs lead to the second floor, which had a large glass floor protected from stepping on by railings at the edges. This area was dedicated as the observation room, symbols of the three temples were placed there too. Finally, from here, the visiting grievers could gaze through the floor to the third area. The third area had been sealed away to protect his Majesty's embalmed body. The Imperial crown and his closest possessions had been buried with him in there, along with the treasures and gifts from his people. And legend goes that any creature who dares disturb his sleep will meet a terrible fate..."

It was meant to put any being who walked its length into a sombre and contemplative mood. The fine stone avenue was flanked on both sides with still water ponds. Across the pond, war memorials recounted the names of all who died to avenge the young emperor. The road got narrower the closer it got to the Mausoleum, emphasising the size of the structure. Those who visited the monument would walk the Avenue of Tears in silence, only sobbing as they approached the Imperial monument."

The dogs were each sculpted as prime specimen of the loyal diamond dogs who had avenged the Emperor, and their muscles could be seen straining as they carried on their backs the eternal flame of sorrow, which lit up the mausoleum and gardens below.\n\nFilled with crystals collected from the deepest and richest mines in Bronzehill, the flame shone a pure white - as pure as the Emperor that had died due to the failings of the Empire that was supposed to save him. Burning without smoke and without a need for fuel, this eternal light would forever shine in pale imitation of the righteousness and virtue lost on that fateful day."

As the statues and the avenue spoke a memory of stone to the Griffonstone dynasty, so did the flowers in the garden. Those that deviated from the Avenue of Tears would find the final resting places of the Righteous Sixty. Those sixty influential figures that sook to eliminate the unmentionable before he could kill the emperor or those that fought in his name in the immediate aftermath. Smaller gardens placed around, all bearing their own names. Eros the Seventeenth. Freiherr von Leuterbach. Graf von Thäler. All those who died in the attempt to stop the tyrant, or who died in the name of the Grover VI. And all of them were angled towards the griffon that they served in life, as they shall serve in death."

Further in, even more statues lined the roads in the shape of heavily armoured and armed knights who would for eternity guard the path to the grave, all in all over two hundred of them. Finally, twelve giant statues cast to resemble the great heroes of the Empire, throughout it history, were placed in a circle around the grave itself, so that the Emperor would forever be surrounded by the faithful."

These murals were meant to represent what place the emperors took in their empires life, omnipresent and renowned. Bronzehill sent their best artists to enrich the last emperor's final resting place with the art that came from the soul of our country. But no clay and paint could truly reflect the absolute greatness the Griffonstone dynasty brought to their lands.

None were forgotten and their names were carved into the stone of the foundations. Now that the work had been finished, it was finally time for the ceremony. The funeral of the Grover VI.\n\nWhen the day arrived, the entire city slowed to a standstill. It was a public holiday all across Herzland, and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of citizens had arrived to take part in the proceedings. Soon the streets were filled to the brim with griffons and diamond dogs, and almost every single one of them carried a candle, lit in remembrance of the Emperor. The citizens solemnly and quietly marched to the center of the city, towards the vast memorial complex. There, countless soldiers of the new Imperial Army stood, immobile like statues, facing the mausoleum. The citizens gathered behind them and around them and waited.\n\nThe main funeral procession then departed the Imperial Palace. The path was lined with candle-holding spectators as the thousands of Imperial servants, diamond dogs, soldiers and others escorted the Emperor's coffin, chanting sorrowful religious songs. At the head of the column was regent Barnaby himself, his head hung low in sorrow. All of them were wearing black clothes.\n\nThe procession proceeded towards the mausoleum itself. The huge crowd watched in complete silence as the coffin was carried by Imperial Knights inside the darkness of the tomb-complex itself. Soon the knights returned without the coffin, and a hundred diamond dogs pushed a gigantic stone slab to seal the tomb for all eternity. There was a loud thump, and then complete, harrowing silence."

His village was Dogish-speaking, something which is looked down upon in wider Bronzehill, and he recieved only token education as a child. At the age of 14 years, he started to work in the coal mines, where he formulated his ideology, based on a combination of folk stories and communist agitation which had spread into the mines. After joining a underground trade union, he learned to read and write in secret, while also becoming a local agitator and organizator.\n\nBarking-Suns political believes, especially with respect to the Griffonstone dynasty, are controversial among not only the wider socialist community (which rejects many of his views outright), but even inside of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill. However, through dedication and hard work, he has won his place in the party - and after overthrowing the \"liberal\" Luxembark, he can finally put his theory into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"

Her family had mainline monarchist political beliefs and promoted a universal education, with her learning literature from an early age. In her youth, she saw the brutal exploitation and horrors capitalism and feudalism brought. She came to hate the tyrants, and in her young adulthood she wrote polemic after polemic against them, calling for their violent overthrow and for them to face the workers' justice--but never the Emperor. To her, the Emperor was a good griff misled by wicked advisors about the true state of his Empire, and if he found out he'd execute them all on the spot.\n\nHer father used his modest prosperity to enable Rosey and her five brothers to study in the prestigious universities of southern Herzland, where she enrolled to study economics, engineering, sociology and biology. During her studies, she learned more of the deep relationship between the Emperor and his nobility, and suffered a brief crisis of faith. As she grappled with the fact that the Emperor was simply the noble-in-chief, she came to moderate her positions. Still a socialist, she now promoted the thought that old institutions could be kept as figureheads, something that she called \"institutional continuity\". To help her fellow comrades, she decided to switch to study law.\n\nBack in Bronzehill, she was a founding member of the Socialist Party, becoming its second chairdog after August Barken. Among fellow socialists, her pro-monarchy views are a continuous topic of controversy.

 BRZ_prelate_gunhild_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th August 949, Griffenheim, Griffonian Empire.\n\n§YBiography§!: Prelate Gunhild was born in Griffenheim into a poor family of tailors. As the third of five children, she decided to join the temples, devoting her life to Boreas. Becoming acolyte at just 14 years, she steadily climbed in the hierarchy, getting a stipend to study theology and finally becoming priestess at impressively young 22 years. Archon Eros followed her carrier with great interest, assigning her to various temples across Herzland. In 984, he finally sent her to Ravensburg, to serve as the Prelate for Bronzehill.\n\nHere, she soon established herself as influential political figure, spreading support for the Emperor, for the temples and for the nobility. In her sermon, she regularly condemns the socialist movement, calling them godless traitors and worse. During her long carrier, she has developed an assertive and hard-line personality, which is however hidden behind her eloquent ways.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

 BRZ_max_goldtooth_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th April 952, Rottendedam, Feathisia.\n\n§YBiography§!: Max Goudtand was born to a diamond dog family in Rottendedam, where his father worked as overseer in a shipyard. Due to the families good income, Goudtand could study economics. At age 25, he decided to go to Bronzehill and opened an iron mine. His business was quite successful, he started to invest also in the refining industry. The "Hüttenwerke Goudtand" grew from there, eventually becoming the largest ore mining business in the whole country.\n\nHis success has earned him both friends and enemies, as many dogs still see him as an "outsider", and despite being a dog some see him barely better than the usual businessgriff. However, by now he has lived in Bronzehill for more than 20 years, trying his best to integrate into the local culture. And his business is one of the main investors in the Grover V Industrial Park - as he claims, to reserve it for a Bronzehillian business."

 BRZ_sweep_stake_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th January 982, Dushzirak, Bronzehill.\n\n§YBiography§!: Sweep Stake was born the small village of Dushzirak ("Dark Peak") up in the mountains near Kaza-Frelsi. She keeps a mystery around her birth name, preferring to go by her cover name as agent. Her puphood she lived in poverty, and so she joined the communist agitation groups active in the area at the early age of 14 years. She immediately turned out to be a capable agent and excellent at both disguising herself and uncovering infiltrators. However, after three years she left the agitation group to find her luck in the bigger city of Kaza-Gull, where she joined the police. Here, her talent was quickly discovered and she was trained as a secret investigator.\n\nDespite her young years, her talent is unquestionable to everydog she worked with, and now she has shown interest in building up a spy agency for the armed forces. However, as she says, she doesn't work for any ideological considerations, but purely for the thrill of planning and executing a mission – to play a game of high risk and high reward."
 # Character Note: Sweep Stake is a little bit of a dog supremacist, and not so loyal to the Griffonstone dynasty. However, as no other dog shares this
 # opinion, she keeps her mouth shut. Also she is very young, only 25 at game start, barely older than Barnaby

He, as well as his two siblings, all joined the police, where he quickly got a reputation of "getting stuff done". However, his approaches have not always been conventional. While he is a skilled investigator, giving honour to his family name, the operations that he commanded where often done with an unusual amount of force. But in these operations he also showed a great deal of personal courage that has earned him the respect of his fellow policedogs. Rising through the carrier ladder, he has now found himself to be the chief of the entire police, a job which he fulfils proudly.\n\nDespite that, he is not overly attached to the court in Bronzekreuz – while he receives little love from the socialists he helped oppress for such a long time, he has never personally spoken out against them, and only fulfilled the orders he was given, or so he tells."

They were once granted the exclusive right to burn charcoal in the area around Crona, which made them incredibly rich. While their monopoly has long been abolished, their family wealth persists as they have invested in various businesses across Herzland. Gotthilf himself studied engineering, and since then has jumped between various positions in the Imperial bureaucracy and his families industries.\n\nIn 1005, he took the job as manager of the Grover V Industrial Park, overseeing its construction, along with managing the investments into the park. To no surprise, he also personally owns some shares in the park. With this, he has grown to become the embodiment of the foreign businessgriff trying to take advantage of Bronzehill – an accusation that he very much denies, claiming to only work for the good of everydog."

He joined the army at age 18, and five years into his service saw the horrors of the revolution. Fighting for the monarchy across the Herzland left him as a changed griff, and since then, he sees his homeland as the only lands truly loyal to the Emperor. His noble attitude disappeared, and he instead argues that the dogs and griffons of Bronzehill, regardless of origin, need to work together to support the Emperor.\n\nAfter twenty years as army commander, he switched to work in the military administration, where he quickly gained a reputation as an effective organizer. He has for a long time called for an increase in Bronzehill's military budget, seeing the nation as woefully unprepared for war. Only time will tell if he can get the opportunity to fix it."

Even as kid, he was interested in architecture, and with a stipend from Bronzekreuz, he could study architectural engineering in Middleheim. Back home, he joined the city planning bureau. As part of his job, he built contacts to the industrialist circles. However, as he is an outspoken opponent of the foreign investment that dominates the interests in the Industrieverein, his career progress slowed down as the businessgriffs saw him as threat to their interests. However, should the outlook of the government on these foreign investments change, Tilo would be happy to help reorganizing Bronzehill's industrial scene..."

 BRZ_johanna_whitetail_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th August 979, Bronzekreuz, Bronzehill\n\n§YBiography§!: Johanna Whitetail was born into a middle income family in Bronzekreuz. Her father worked as baker, owning a local bakery, while her mother was working as a clerk in Bronzehill's administration. While her family never was rich, she enjoyed a well-protected puphood. Her family didn't have enough money to send her to university, and so Johanna decided to follow her mother's footsteps and started a career as bureaucrat.\n\nHer job was hard and unrewarding. As minor administrator she had to enforce laws that she disagreed with, the people she looked over didn't appreciate her works and her higher-ups only ever bemoaned the "trouble" that occasionally arose when she tried to follow the laws.\n\nHowever, all of this changed suddenly after the dogs of Bronzehill took Griffenheim and proclaimed their regency. She was ordered to Griffenheim and had to rebuild the department for economic development from scratch. With more freedom at paw, she showed a good talent in making friends with both her superiors and her subordinates. She also proved to have good mathematical and organizational skills, certainly necessary for the leader of an increasingly important department.\n\nAnd as her latest achievement, she was entrusted to plan and implement the "Imperial Economic Development Initiative". She certainly seems excited to do so, and has already developed a variety of ideas."

As usual for a noble of her status, she joined the Imperial army in 964, were she became a commander of a guard brigade. During the Revolution of 978, she fought on the side of the monarchists, before retiring three years later.\n\nIn the following decades, she spent her time managing her vast lands, but also building a network of influence among her fellow nobles. In this position, she was noticed by [BRZ.GetLeader] as somegriff who could provide useful contacts and that also has a fair bit of experience in agricultural matters. She graciously agreed to join the Imperial administration, where she has the position of an arbiter between the court and the nobles of the Empire."

However, unlike other families in Skyfall, his family was up and close to the Imperial court. When Skyfall declared independence in the aftermath of the revolution, the businesses of the Geldsacks suffered. In the politics of the new nation, they were lone voices of reconciliation with and even reintegration into the Empire – something that drew suspicion from other influential figures.\n\nNow that Skyfall is once more part of the Empire, Laszlo Geldsack hopes to turn around his family's history. With support from the Imperial palace, the formerly almost unknown banker has made it to be Skyfalls new mayor. As he seems content to be little more than a stadtholder for the palace, the Imperial regent praises him as an example of cooperation between court and the cities."

A skirmish near the outskirts of Kloburg would see her rally the remnants of two decimated infantry squads, and lead them to successfully capture a Republican communications outpost. Since then she has preferred to lead from the front, as close to her soldiers as safety, and her fellow officers, will allow.\n\nWhile the Emperor is safe in Griffonheim for now, Shorttail still tries to encourage fierce bravery among her soldiers that some would say borders on reckless. She insists, however, that such fierce determination will be needed when the time inevitably comes to retake the Duchy of Cloudbury."
