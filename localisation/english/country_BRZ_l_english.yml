# General remarks for writers: 
# Please use International (Standard/Oxford) English, also called British English. Please do not use American English.
# As Bronzehill is a Herzlander (German) speaking nation, you might want to use some German words for flavour or immersion. Please do this rarely and only for single words that represent important concepts (examples: Volksreligion (= People's religion) for Luxembark or Wehrsportspiele (=Military/Defence sport games) for Loudbark). If you do not speak German, ping HerrB on discord to help you out.
# Some parts of Bronzehill speak also Dogish (Khuzdul). However, Dogish words should only be used exceptionally rarely, if at all. Please ping HerrB on discord to confirm that the lore fits. Please remember that Dogish is a minority language even among the dogs of Bronzehill, only spoken by ~25% of the population, with ~95% (also) speaking Herzlander.
# Thank you! - HerrB

 # Starting
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Finish The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The \"Grover V Industrial Park\" is the name given to large industrial park near Ravensburg. It is almost ready to be opened, but the dam to generate the electricity had been plagued by problems for the last month. It is time to put in the effort and finish this."
 
 BRZ_paving_the_roads:0 "Paving The Roads"
 BRZ_paving_the_roads_desc:0 "Now that the new industrial park is open, we have to make the most out of it. The roads around Ravensburg could use some better paving, so that goods can flow in and out of the industrial park. We will get to work."
 
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers:0 "Invite Griffenheim Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers_desc:0 "While the Grover V Industrial Park surely is a good investment, we need to be prepared for any future trouble. We will invite engineers from Griffenheim to work and live in Ravensburg, so that we can keep the park operational if a catastrophy like 978 would shake the empire again."
 
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Contracts With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "Why should we stop here? With the Grover V Industrial Park starting to be a success story, this can only mean good things for the Bronzehill economy. Our dear Count Ignatius will sign even more contracts will companies from Griffenheim."

 # Autonomist side
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Nationalize The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "It was utter insanity to allow the park to be operated in the way it was. Herzlander companies bought out more and more of the Bronzehillian economy, and our government only watched it happen. We will fix that, starting with the park itself."
 
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production:0 "Increase Domestic Food Production"
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production_desc:0 "In the past, most of Bronzehill's food was imported from wider Herzland, as we focused on mining and refining ores. With our trade relationships with other Herzland nations souring in the wake of our new political situation, we need to increase domestic production."
 
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy:0 "Diversify Bronzehill's Economy"
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy_desc:0 "Our economy needs to be able to stand more autonomous. It is not enough for us to focus on iron and steel anymore, if we can't reliably trade it for other goods. Our focus should be to diversify our industry, and luckily for us, the now nationalized Grover V industrial park can be used to do that."
 
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net:0 "Build A Social Safety Net"
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net_desc:0 "There is still a lingering economic crisis in Bronzehill, and many dogs still are destitute. Our help to these dogs will be doubly beneficial: Not only will we get more better fed, thus more productive workers, but also increased domestic demand, something that will help our economy to prosper again."
 
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust:0 "The Bronzehill Steel Trust"
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust_desc:0 "There are many steel producers in Bronzehill, and not a small amount of them are either still in the claws of businessgriffs or freshly nationalized. Yet, they are struggling as our exports are not doing great. Unifying them into a steel trust, the "Vereinigte Stahlwerke", will help us profit from our steel again."
 
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "Much of our steel industry is still held by private investors, both domestic and foreign. This can no longer stand! The workers demand that we give them control, so that the rich capitalists profit of their work no longer. Instead, the steel industry will be combined into the "Kombinat Kaza-Gull"."
 
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds:0 "Increase Engineering Funds"
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds_desc:0 "Our domestic production still suffers from a lack of industrial engineers. Our production methods are outdated, our industrial sectors run off old machinery and our output is trailing other nations in Herzland. Giving new funds to train and attract engineers can only help us here."
 
 # Shared
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget:0 "Expand The Rural School Budget"
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget_desc:0 "Our education system still doesn't reach many of the small villages in Bronzehill, particularly in the mountains. Already under Count Georgie, the Rural School Program was initiated to alleviate the situation. Even though things have improved, the program still suffers from insufficient funding and a lack of teachers. It's high time to change that."
 
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers:0 "Invite Electronic Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers_desc:0 "One area where Bronzehill is particularly lacking is in the new and coming sector of electronics. If we want to improve our research, we need more talent in this sector."
 
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home:0 "Our Talents At Home"
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home_desc:0 "It would be wrong to entirely ignore what talent we already have at home. We are Diamond Dogs, not Griffons, and we should make use of what we are good at. New specialists should research about our own abilities, so that we can use them best."
 
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Found The Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "Bronzehill is so poor in scientist, that we don’t even have our own domestic university. But with the recent influx of talent, attracted by our various programs, we finally have everything together to found our very own university for research and education, here in our capital."
 
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system:0 "Modernize The Education System"
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system_desc:0 "Our education system still suffers from being outdated on various topics. With new capacities to educate teachers here in Bronzehill, we should make sure that these teachers have all the tools they need and a up-to-date curriculum at paw."
 
 # Loyalty side
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl:0 "Negotiations With Krähe-Stahl"
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl_desc:0 "Now that the political situation is somewhat under control, we can resume our long task of resolving Bronzehill's economic crisis. A first step in this is to negotiate with Krähe-Stahl, one of the main operators of the Grover V Industrial Park."
 
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system:0 "Liberalize The Banking System"
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system_desc:0 "Bronzehill needs investment; there can be little doubt about that. To further our economic development, we will liberalize certain laws regarding credits and securities... hopefully this will convince some banks that we are worth an investment."
 
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth:0 "Give Support To Goldtooth"
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth_desc:0 "Max Goldtooth is one of the richest, if not the richest griffons in Bronzehill. Of course he is from Griffenheim and some dogs loath him for that. But he has built a large industrial conglomerate here, has invested more than a claw full of idols into the industrial district and most importantly, he is living in Bronzekreuz. Supporting his enterprises is good for us all."
 
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength:0 "Utilize Our Strength"
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength_desc:0 "Invest in your strength, and supplant your weaknesses, this should be our motto. Yes, we dogs are not as skilled in agriculture as other species might be, but we all the more skilled in our mining business that we are famous for. Let us use that."
 
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry:0 "Industrial Cooperation With Strawberry"
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry_desc:0 "In our new position, Strawberry is getting ever more important as trading partner. Several of their investors have shown interest in forming a group to organize their investment in Bronzehill. This is something we should further, so that our economy can profit."
 
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus:0 "Krähe-Stahl Bronzehill"
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus_desc:0 "Krähe-Stahl, the famous industrial conglomerate from Griffenheim, has agreed to officially open a branch office in Bronzekreuz. We will grant them large economic freedoms in exchange for steady investment."
 
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Expand The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park might have had a slow start, but it is now showing definite signs of success. The hydroelectric power from the Ravensburg dam is used almost completely, but this cannot stop us. We will expand the park by building new power plants."
 
 ## Military Initial
 
 BRZ_military_budget_review:0 "Review The Military Budget"
 BRZ_military_budget_review_desc:0 "The current crisis in the Empire has the potential to cause strife, if not outright war. While Bronzehill has traditionally maintained only a small army, the coming times could force us to change our approach quite drastically."
 
 BRZ_home_defence:0 "Home Defence"
 BRZ_home_defence_desc:0 "If Bronzehill should really get involved in a future war, we need to focus on defending our homes from the invaders. Let us prepare defensive plans on how we could stall any possible invading force."
 
 BRZ_western_defence_line:0 "Western Defence Line"
 BRZ_western_defence_line_desc:0 "The first step in our plan to protect Bronzehill is to build a defensive line running north to south, protecting Bronzekreuz and the lands behind it. The northern mountains would be used for defence, otherwise we will build behind the river."
 
 BRZ_southern_defence_line:0 "Southern Defence Line"
 BRZ_southern_defence_line_desc:0 "The southern defence line is for the worst case scenario – an attack from Griffenheim. Luckily, we can make use of the natural lakes and rivers, running a defence line from Pfotenhausen in the West through Hundsfeld and Ravensburg until we hit the Hellquillian border on the east."
 
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies:0 "Protecting Our Skies"
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies_desc:0 "The cruelties of air warfare are beginning to show themselves in the conflicts we hear about in the wider world. As we know that many nations that surround us are also building an air fleet, we need to invest in counter measures."
 
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat:0 "The Mountain Retreat"
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat_desc:0 "We dogs are people of the mountains. While many of our cities are built above the ground, every dog can still go underground if we need to. If our situation becomes really desperate, we can decide to move our administration away from the southern flatlands into the mountain, evacuating as many dogs and griffons as possible."
 
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy:0 "Challenge Our Legacy"
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy_desc:0 "The population of Bronzehill has always viewed war with horror. Violent behaviour was associated with the crimes of the Diamond Mountain slavers, something that was shunned in Bronzehill. However, we need to remind the dogs that someday the Emperor could call us to arms again – then we should not cower away."
 
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill:0 "The Army Of Bronzehill"
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill_desc:0 "We need to review the state of our current land forces. Their equipment is as outdated as their fighting tactics – we have a long way to go before our army is truly ready for combat."
 
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns:0 "Modernize Our Guns"
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns_desc:0 "The army of Bronzehill still operates with many old guns. We should do a concentrated effort to develop newer, more powerful guns, otherwise we will fall behind in combat capability."
 
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion:0 "Cannons Are Our Passion"
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion_desc:0 "Bronzehill is famous for its metals, and not too long ago, was also one of the prime producers of cannons for the empire. Yet, we have rarely used these guns for ourselves, nor have we produced them as much since the revolution. But we should get back on track."
 
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain:0 "Our Natural Terrain"
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain_desc:0 "As diamond dogs, we live in the mountains – literally in the mountains sometimes. As such, we have developed a very fine sense of how to operate here. If our enemies can't counter this, we should use it."
 
 BRZ_electronic_support:0 "Electronic Support"
 BRZ_electronic_support_desc:0 "The advancements made in electronics have certainly impacted the way future wars will be fought. The newest invention is the so-called RADAR technology which would help us to spot enemy forces in advance. We should invest in it."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad:0 "A Bronzehill Air Squad"
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad_desc:0 "We dogs have not a natural ability to fly like the griffons do, but all the more should we be interested in the developments of airplanes. Let us establish a Bronzehill air squad by procuring a few airplanes from friendly sources in Herzland."
 
 ## Political Initial
 
 # Introduction
 BRZ_call_the_bronzehill_council:0 "Call The Bronzehill Council"
 BRZ_call_the_bronzehill_council_desc:0 "The death of our dear emperor Grover V has caused a major political crisis in Bronzehill. Count Ignatius therefore will convene the Bronzehill Council, to deliberate the way how to go forward."
 
 BRZ_tea_with_copperhill:0 "Tea With Copperhill"
 BRZ_tea_with_copperhill_desc:0 "One of the most prominent politicians in Bronzehill, Lord Winston Copperhill is the leader of the Harmonic-Conservative Party (HKP). As one of the influencial figures in Bronzehill, Count Ignatius wants to meet the Lord in private."
 
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest_desc:0 "Count Ignatius is not the only one who is interested in potential councillors. Barnaby had an idea of his own, and has invited an unusual guest into Bronzehill Castle, to discuss some things that Ignatius doesn't need to know about - for now at least."
 
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark is the chairdog of the militarist and populist National Union, and fully lives up to his name. But in this matter, Count Ignatius preferes a more calm environment, for some things need to be discussed discretely."
 
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills:0 "Up In The Hills"
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills_desc:0 "Not all power in Bronzehills comes from the palace. Even though the Count rules absolute, there are plenty of dogs who hold little loyalty to him. And one of them had just found out very interesting details to think about."
 
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg_desc:0 "The prelate of Bronzehill, located in Ravensburg, is normally only concerned with religious matters. However, in times when the socialist movement openly defies the will of Boreas, it is hard to stay out of politics."
 
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas:0 "Barnaby's Ideas"
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas_desc:0 "The final list of councillors is almost complete. All the political factions in Bronzehill have found their place in the council. Or have they? Crown Prince Barnaby think that Ignatius has forgotten something, but Barnaby has already an idea."
 
 BRZ_the_councils_opens:0 "The Council Opens"
 BRZ_the_councils_opens_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council has been called. Count Ignatius will open the council with a speach to the councillors, and then Prince Barnaby will oversee the deliberation of the council. And at the end, surely, the Council will make a united statement in support of Ignatius and the regent in Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_a_change_of_course:0 "A Change Of Course"
 BRZ_a_change_of_course_desc:0 "We have decided to accept the vote of the Bronzehill Council. Count Ignatius will step back, but now the Bronzehill Council needs to find a way out of the political crisis."
 
 BRZ_old_loyalties:0 "Old Loyalties"
 BRZ_old_loyalties_desc:0 "We have decided to dismiss the vote of the Bronzehill Council. The dogs will prove their loyalty to the emperor not by trying to overthrow his regency, but by fighting along them for the glory of the empire."
 
 # Regent in Exile path
 
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile:0 "The Regent In Exile"
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has become regent in Griffenheim, much to the dismay of the nobility, including Count Ignatius. Bronzehill will not stand by this theocratic madness, but instead support Gabriela Eagleclaw, who has vowed to wrangle the regency of Eros and to rehabilitate the nobility."
 
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter:0 "Trip To Readewetter"
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter_desc:0 "If we want to support Gabriela in overthrowing the Archon and taking the regency, we need to formalize our alliance as soon as possible. Count Ignatius will personally travel to Readewetter to meet Gabriela and to discuss further details."
 
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp:0 "Work With The HKP"
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp_desc:0 "In contrast to the radicals from the Socialists or the National Union, the Harmonic-Conservatives are not a fundamental thread to Bronzehill. While their reform agenda might be uncomfortable to some, in this situation they are our best bet to coax back some of the support we have lost."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command:0 "Purge The High Command"
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command_desc:0 "The high command has shown a disturbingly close relationship with Loudbark's National Union. In the current political climate, these connections could easily become a thread to our rule. We will retire the worst offenders, while promoting new staff from the loyal nobility."
 
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate:0 "Help From The Prelate"
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Gunhild is not too happy that we have thrown our support behind Gabriela – as appointee from Eros, she argued in favour of his regency. However, Gunhild knows her position, as well as the current political climate. We will work together to curb the ongoing socialist agitation."
 
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights:0 "Loyalty Of The Knights"
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights_desc:0 "Much like Gunhild, Grandmaster Lucky from the Knights of Bronzekreuz has shown a preference for Eros. We will need to remind the Knights that they have sworn an oath to us. To further bind them to our cause, we will send them to hunt the last socialist agitators that continue to be a thorn in our side."
 
 BRZ_gather_noble_support:0 "Gather Noble Support"
 BRZ_gather_noble_support_desc:0 "The nobles of Bronzehill are the fundament of our rule, now more than ever. Yet a surprising amount of nobles seems to be rather passive, instead of openly supporting the Count. We have to remind them of what is at stake here."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_desc:0 "With our rule secured, we can finally proclaim the crisis to be over and send the councillors home. They have been an obstacle to our goals for long enough."
 
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry:0 "Trade With Strawberry"
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry_desc:0 "After we have favoured Gabriela over Eros, our trade with Griffenheim has predictably taken a hit. However, our alliance with Strawberry also includes various economic treaties. It is high time we act on these treaties and bring our economy back on track."
 
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts:0 "Renegotiate Industrial Contracts"
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts_desc:0 "At the time we negotiated with Krähe-Stahl and other companies from Griffenheim over future investment in Bronzehill, nodog could have seen coming that we would break with Griffenheim. But it has happened, and now we have to secure our economy. We will approach them to renegotiate some of the clauses in our investment pacts."
 
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support:0 "Rebuild Popular Support"
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support_desc:0 "This whole affair has cost us a fair bit of popular support. But with the political crisis mostly over, we can focus on rebuilding the trust of the common dog."
 
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares:0 "Shuffle Industrial Shares"
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares_desc:0 "Not all companies that we have investment agreements with are from Griffenheim. In fact, a fair share of them is from Strawberry, which already is one of the richer parts of Herzland. With some targeted laws and regulations, we will shift our support to the companies that are compatible with our new alignment."
 
 BRZ_in_denfence_of_tradition:0 "In Defence Of Tradition"
 BRZ_in_denfence_of_tradition_desc:0 "It is important to remember for every dog that we fight for a just cause: Against theocratic radicalism and for the trusted rule of the nobility. We will spread the message across Bronzehill, so that every dog can see why we stand against Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors:0 "Invite Yale Professors"
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors_desc:0 "Bronzehill's academia is quite small in comparison to the intellectual centres in Herzland. To improve our research efforts, we will invite griffon professors from Greenback and Yale. If we give out generous grants, hopefully a sufficient number will join us so that our academia gets a noticeable boost."
 
 # Loyalty to Griffenheim path
 
 BRZ_the_rightful_regent:0 "The Rightful Regent"
 BRZ_the_rightful_regent_desc:0 "Our bonds to Griffenheim will not be shaken, regardless of whom the wise griffons of Grover's court choose as regent. The dogs of Bronzehill are there to serve the emperor, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim:0 "Envoy To Griffenheim"
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "We have thrown our full support behind the rightful regent, but this does not solve our political crisis at home yet. When we send an official envoy to Griffenheim it will not only show the empire our admiration, but also serve as a warning to our political opponents at home."
 
 BRZ_gather_the_knights:0 "Gather The Knights"
 BRZ_gather_the_knights_desc:0 "Grandmaster Lucky of the Knights of Bronzekreuz has already expressed interest in taking on the problem with the socialists in our country. We have long been hesitant, but in our new situation, we need decisive action. Grandmaster Lucky can deliver that."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility:0 "Unite The Nobility"
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility_desc:0 "We should not forget that a fair few nobles in the council seemed to favour the notion of a Bronzehill regency. But now that the matter is decided, we need to unite the nobles behind us. Division makes us weak in the face of our political opponents that still hide in the shadows."
 
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies:0 "Clear Military Hierachies"
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies_desc:0 "One of the most pressing issues for us is the loyalty of the army – Loudbark seems to have infiltrated the army rather successfully. We should ask in Griffenheim for some army advisors, which would bolster our command structure and coincidentally also make it secured against a future takeover attempt."
 
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB:0 "Outlaw The SPB"
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB_desc:0 "This farce has been going on for long enough. We have tried to handle the socialist movement by making some reforms while banning their more dangerous ideas, yet it has not come to fruition. Now, we will make the hammer come down and outright ban the Socialist Party."
 
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages:0 "Spread Loyalist Messages"
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages_desc:0 "Every dog should know that what we aspire to is to help and support the emperor. This is the least common denominator for every dog in Bronzehill, and we will base our propaganda efforts on it. The idea of a Bronzehill-led regency is just crazy-talk by dangerous people."
 
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim:0 "Invite Advisors From Griffenheim"
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim_desc:0 "Bronzehill's industry is still lacking, and the ongoing political crisis has shaken our administration as well. What could be more natural to ask our overlord to help us out? Griffon advisors will make everything easier, while also helping to control any lingering unrest."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist_desc:0 "The crisis is over, finally. The Bronzehill Council has been a thorn in our side instead of being helpful, but now we have gathered enough political strength to send them home. Boreas bless them, and farewell."
 
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity:0 "A True Show Of Unity"
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council was originally intendent to show the united support of the dogs for the emperor. This worked rather mediocre, to be polite. However, with the political crisis over, we are finally ready to unite behind the emperor and his regent. Our bond will never be broken."
 
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs:0 "Most Loyal And Faithful Dogs"
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs_desc:0 "The newfound unity of the dogs will also make itself known in the army. If we fight, we fight for the emperor, and we will fight proudly under his flag."
 
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim:0 "Reinvigorate Trade With Griffenheim"
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim_desc:0 "Despite our strong bonds, the economic relation with Griffenheim has been lacking lately, mostly due to their own economic troubles. But with the empire slowly getting back on track, our trade relationship should deepen again. If we do it right, Bronzehill's economy will gain a good boost out of this."
 
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park:0 "The Grover V Memorial Park"
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park_desc:0 "Grover V was truly a great emperor. A grand park in Bronzekreuz will be constructed to honour and remember him. This will both serve as a nice addition to our city, being a place to relax and enjoy, and also as a reminder for all dogs that we are the most loyal subjects of his majesty."
 
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire:0 "The Forge Of The Empire"
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire_desc:0 "In the old times, before it all came crashing down in the revolution, Bronzehill was known as the “Forge of the Empire”. We dogs are well versed in how to extract and refine the treasures of the earth, be it metals or gems. While we might have a long way to go before our old glory can be reclaimed, we will make our efforts known."

 BRZ_barking_suns_coup:0 "Barking-Sun's Coup"
 BRZ_barking_suns_coup_desc:0 "With the Bronzehill Council in deadlock, Barking-Sun has finally made his move and overthrown the government with the help of his loyal mining dogs. The Count has fled, but resistance to our rule remains. Our great task begins here."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_army:0 "Secure The Army"
 BRZ_secure_the_army_desc:0 "The Army is the institution most hostile to our new government. But when Barking-Sun can appeal to the mining dogs, he can also sway the common soldier. As for the commanders... we need to destroy the old command structure of the army as quickly as possible, to secure a future for our regime."
 
 BRZ_target_the_national_union:0 "Target The National Union"
 BRZ_target_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is our greatest political enemy. Now that we have taken control of Bronzekreuz, we can finally move to destroy them once and for all. Down with the reaction!"
 
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp:0 "Disband The HKP"
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp_desc:0 "The Harmonic-Conservative Party is a group of weaklings, pseudo-reformers and double-faced reactionaries. Their claims of peace and liberty are lies to deceive the working class, for they want to keep the old oppressors in their lofty positions. Our revolution has made them terrified, and rightfully so: They are the next to go."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge The Nobles"
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have already seen from where the wind is blowing and have abandoned their estates. However, others are fighting in the shadows or openly defy our rule. Here, any temperance would be our downfall, we have to strike fast and hard."
 
 BRZ_hunt_the_count:0 "Hunt The Count"
 BRZ_hunt_the_count_desc:0 "Ignatius, the old Count of Bronzehill, has fled the capital as our revolution broke out. His whereabouts is currently unknown, an unacceptable security risk for our government. We will start a great hunt to either force him to flee our borders or, even better, to have him executed."
 
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy:0 "Mobilize The Economy"
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy_desc:0 "We have the high goal of marching on Griffenheim and saving Grover VI from his ill advisors and deceptive nobles. However, for that we need guns, cannons and other war material. We will have to fully mobilize the economy of Bronzehill and Barking-Sun has just the right ideas on how to do it."
 
 BRZ_liberation_corps:0 "Liberation Corps"
 BRZ_liberation_corps_desc:0 "The ''Befreiungskorps'' (Liberation Corps) are special units staffed with only the most loyal supporters of Barking-Sun, mostly his old comrades from the mines. They will be essential for conquering Griffenheim. May they live up to their name!"
 
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication:0 "Principle Of Total Dedication"
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication_desc:0 "The Principle of total dedication is quite simple: Everything for the emperor. We work, fight and die for him. There can no thought but his liberation on our minds. This is our duty, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_industrial_independence:0 "Industrial Independence"
 BRZ_industrial_independence_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill is still entangled in trade with Griffenheim and other parts of Herzland. With nothing but traitors to the emperor surrounding us, we cannot accept this, but we need to work extra hard to ensure our industrial independence."
 
 BRZ_new_academia:0 "New Academia"
 BRZ_new_academia_desc:0 "The academic system of Bronzehill needs a total makeover. We need to focus our research efforts on the things that matter to us, namely how to best defeat the false regent in Griffenheim. Otherwise, we need to cull research that is not on our political line."
 
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy:0 "Barking-Sun's Philosophy"
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy_desc:0 "Barking-Sun is not much of an academic writer, but he surely has a clear view of the world. With the help of some academic that have proven their loyalty, Barking-Sun will publish a book for every good dog to carry around. As it is printed with a red cover, it will soon enough be known as the ''little red book''."
 
 # Luxembark path
 
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate:0 "The Outsider Candidate"
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate_desc:0 "To the surprise of everyone, Rosey Luxembark has won the race for chancellorship. The more established political parties are still in utter confusion how she got here, but our new government has a clear task: To reform Bronzehill so that the workingdogs can finally take their fair share."
 
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs:0 "A Government For The Workingdogs"
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs_desc:0 "The SPB always was the true defender of working rights in Bronzehill. We have stood up for the common dog when others hid behind promises of reform or populist lies. Now that we have the strings of power in our paws, we can truly bring forth a government for the workingdogs."
 
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles:0 "Curtail The Nobles"
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have reacted with concern to Luxembark's chancellorship, with some even calling for openly resisting her rule. With cannot stand. While we don't intend to abolish their titles, we need to curtail their political power so that they can no longer threaten our plans to reforge the economy."
 
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws:0 "Reverse The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "For a long time, the operations of the SPB and the socialist movement were hamstringed by a series of laws dubbed the ''socialist laws'', which outlawed our organizations and writings. However, with this, the reactionaries have set a legal precedent, which we can now turn on its head. From now on, reactionary propaganda is banned in Bronzehill."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union:0 "Purge The National Union"
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is a collection of militarists, reactionaries and imperialists, in short, the anti-thesis to our government. And of course, their chairdog Rufus Loudbark has tried to turn the army against our government ever since it came to be. But with the new anti-reactionary laws at paw, we can finally shatter their movement."
 
 BRZ_replace_the_count:0 "Replace The Count"
 BRZ_replace_the_count_desc:0 "Until now, Count Ignatius has accepted our government, if only barely. However, there can be little doubt that he intends to overthrow our government as soon as he gets the opportunity. While Rosey Luxembark does not intend to abolish the monarchy, we could just force Ignatius to abdicate in favour of Barnaby, who is much less of a threat to our government."
 
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils:0 "Introduce Worker Councils"
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils_desc:0 "One of the key program points is the establishment of worker councils, which would serve as a democratic root for the socialist party. However, let us not put our hind paws in the front. For now, the worker councils will not directly take over the economy, but serve as counsel for the factory workers."
 
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs:0 "Expropriate The Oligarchs"
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs_desc:0 "The businessgriffs from Herzland, but also various domestic nobles and businessdogs have formed an oligarchical power structure that controls Bronzhill's economy. We cannot stand for this. We will expropriate the worst cases and levy heavy taxes on the rest, so that our government can gain back control over our economy."
 
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog:0 "March Of The Working Dog"
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog_desc:0 "The ''March of the Workingdogs'' is a famous political song from Bronzehill, adapted by us as the new anthem. United we stand, for the common good. Singing this song, we will march on Griffenheim and bring forth a new era of socialist cooperation and workers democracy."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry:0 "Sway The Peasantry"
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The agrarian population of Bronzehill is large and consists of many destitute dogs and griffons. Yet, they have not heart our call and stayed apathetic to our government's reforms. We have to go on the offensive and listen to their issues, so that the every dog can stand united."
 
 BRZ_worker_self_organization:0 "Worker Self-Organization"
 BRZ_worker_self_organization_desc:0 "First results from the expropriation of nobles are in, and the results are astounding. It is clear that factories work better if the workers can decide themselves how to organize. They don't need bosses to shove them around, for they have the most experience of how things really work."
 
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Expand Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "The University of Bronzekreuz is still young, but it is expanding rapidly. Bronzehill needs new talent; it needs researchers, engineers, teachers and other professionals to be able to stand up to Griffenheim. We will put in another massive expansion round for the university, to hopefully attract new talent from back home and abroad."
 
 # Barnaby path
 
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby:0 "Give Power To Barnaby"
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby_desc:0 "With Copperhill’s ascendance to chancellorship, our country is now on the track of democratic and harmonic reform. Given Barnaby’s close relationship with him in the past, it is best for our nation if Ignatius would step down and pass the crown to the crown prince, something that he has agreed to do."
 
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists:0 "Negotiate With The Socialists"
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists_desc:0 "The radicals from the SPB have expressed their discontent with our reform agenda and agitate against us with their radical slogans. However, the SPB also has a rather large faction of moderates, which could be won over if we prove ourselves as genuine reformers. We will listen to their demands,  as when they switch sides, the rest of the SPB will sink into irrelevance."
 
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws:0 "Labour Reform Laws"
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws_desc:0 "Our promises to the progressives and moderate socialists should not stay empty, or otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble once more. But our labour reforms are not socialist in nature, but aim to create a more just, equal and harmonious society."
 
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda:0 "Start The Reform Agenda"
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda_desc:0 "The list of problems in Bronzehill is long, and so is the list our planned reforms. With Barnaby and Copperhill at the helm, we can finally make our dreams of a better Bronzehill into a reality. Our first step is to formalize our rule by creating a cabinet with clear administrative responsibilities."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles:0 "Sway The Nobles"
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have looked with concern on all of our promises, as they fear that we will come after their privileges. And this is true, to some extent. Yet, we have to make it clear to them that this is the best they can hope for anyways. In this modernizing world, a society build purely on nobles is weak, as proven by the revolution of 978."
 
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union:0 "Undermine The National Union"
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union_desc:0 "The last place we have to bring to our side is the army. Loudbark has a tight grip on the soldiers, but our reform agenda will improve their lives too. We will go to the barracks to tell and listen, so that hopefully they will abandon their radicalism for our harmony."
 
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Deal With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "There is no way of putting it mildly: These businessgriffs, whether from Griffenheim or somewhere else in Herzland, are a stain on Bronzehill’s economy and we need to do something about them. Although large-scale nationalizations run against our party principles in general, in this case there is simply no way around it."
 
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections:0 "New City Council Elections"
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections_desc:0 "Until now, the city councils were elected under a census suffrage system, where only middle and upper class residents could vote. However, we have now abandoned this system in favour of a true universal suffrage, and it is time to put this new law into practice. New city council elections will be held, open to everyone."
 
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice:0 "Our Cause For Justice"
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice_desc:0 "When we march against Griffenheim, it is not out of treason to the empire, no, it is rather in the desire to bring true justice, harmony and equality to the empire as a whole. Grover needs a good regent, who can reform the empire, not selfish nobles or lunatic theocrats."
 
 BRZ_domestic_investments:0 "Domestic Investments"
 BRZ_domestic_investments_desc:0 "Bronzehill’s economy is still very weak. We need to reinvest whatever money we have, so that our economy backbone is strong enough to survive the coming troubles."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_reformers:0 "Unite The Reformers"
 BRZ_unite_the_reformers_desc:0 "There are many reform minded dogs and griffons in Bronzehill. With the recent council elections, we have proven to them that we are not here to talk, but to take action. We stand for what we say, and if the support us, it will not be in vain."
 
 # Loudbark path
 
 BRZ_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
 BRZ_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark has claimed the chancellorship. Under his firm paw, Bronzehill will be transformed into the most loyal guard of the emperor, although we first have to rescue the emperor from his bad advisors. With the military at the forefront, our greatness is secured."
 
 BRZ_sharpen_the_socialist_laws:0 "Sharpen The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_sharpen_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "The Socialist Laws were an approach by Ignatius and his supporters to curtail the socialist movement without actually banning it. What a nonsense approach! We will solve this issue once and for all, and as a first step we will ban all remaining socialist organizations, including the SPB."
 
 BRZ_expand_rural_subsidies:0 "Expand Rural Subsidies"
 BRZ_expand_rural_subsidies_desc:0 "We cannot forget any of our supporters. Yes, the army is our main strength, but without the peasants who proudly stood against socialist agitation, we would not be where we are now. In return, we will set up new subsidies for the peasantry."
 
 BRZ_our_city_reforms:0 "Our City Reforms"
 BRZ_our_city_reforms_desc:0 "The National Union believes in democracy, we really do. However, this democracy cannot get in the way of an orderly and secure society. We will drop the census suffrage currently used by the city councils, but in turn we will ensure that only trusted candidates can stand in the council elections."
 
 BRZ_using_the_army:0 "Using The Army"
 BRZ_using_the_army_desc:0 "The army is our greatest asset, and exactly the right tool to use against the remaining socialist agitators. We will raid their hiding spots and fight their street gangs. Let’s see how their puny ''militias'' will do against our armoured cars."
 
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act:0 "The Nationalization Act"
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act_desc:0 "The assets of the various Herzland companies in Bronzehill are nothing short of foreign meddling in our affairs. These businessgriffs seem to think that just because they invested a few idols they get to decide what ''their'' companies should produce or who they should employ. Well, only one solution then."
 
 BRZ_approach_the_nobles:0 "Approach The Nobles"
 BRZ_approach_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have opposed Loudbark for a long time, seeing his ideas as hazardous and populist. But the situation has changed. No longer is it about gaining political power, it is now about coming to terms with the new reality. Some nobles have already endorsed Loudbark, and we now have to convince the rest of them."
 
 BRZ_the_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 BRZ_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Our industry and our army need to be in close cooperation. After all, what is all that industry for, if not to produce what our armies need? Sure, we also need various goods for the dogs of our nation, but this is only so that these dogs can serve as soldiers, right?"
 
 BRZ_unleash_the_dogs_of_war:0 "Unleash The Dogs Of War"
 BRZ_unleash_the_dogs_of_war_desc:0 "As escaped slaves, Bronzehill has a pacifist history. For a long time, we saw war as something that would bring only harm and suffering. However, the recent changes we have made start to effectively challenge that mind-set.  If we do it right, we can unleash the dogs of war, that they may rescue the emperor."
 
 BRZ_militarization_of_the_police:0 "Militarization Of The Police"
 BRZ_militarization_of_the_police_desc:0 "What is the police for? They are your friend and helper, sure, but they are also to keep our society in order and devious elements in check. And for that, they need proper equipment and training. We will give them better guns, armoured cars and wide ranging authority to fulfil their duty."
 
 BRZ_build_the_hundsfeld_military_academy:0 "Build The Hundsfeld Military Academy"
 BRZ_build_the_hundsfeld_military_academy_desc:0 "So far, Bronzehill has no military academy of its own. Until now, the few dogs that became officers used the Imperial academies, mostly the one in Helheim. However, our ties with Griffenheim are cut, if only temporarily, and also there can never be enough military academia. Therefore, we will open a new military academy in Hundsfeld."
 
 BRZ_end_griffenheim_control:0 "End Griffenheim Control"
 BRZ_end_griffenheim_control_desc:0 "Even after so many reforms, there are still some ways in which Griffenheim is able to pull the strings in our nation. From various trade relationships to some shares that so far have escaped nationalization, these dependencies need to be cut. Bronzehill will be strong on its own."

 ### IDEAS ###
 # Industry
 BRZ_imperial_industry:0 "Imperial Owned Industry"
 BRZ_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Many griffons in Griffenheim have invested in Bronzehill, leaving very few local-owned mines, farms and factories. While this has helped develop Bronzehill's industrial capabilities, it has caused worry among locals who fear for their County's stability and soveignty. The issue will have to be addressed in some form, lest the whole nation ends up in the ownership of foreigners."

 BRZ_grover_vi:0 "Grover VI of Griffonstone"
 BRZ_grover_vi_desc:0 "Emperor Grover, sixth of his name, has so far shared the fate of his father. An orphan too young to rule, a regency has been established to govern in his stead, leaving the young griffon as a powerless figurehead. However, unlike with Grover V the regents aren't selfish and corrupt fools. Not only that, but Grover VI is not sickly or weak, but has a sharp and curious mind as well as a natural talent for leadership. He has great potential, but only time will tell if it will be fulfilled.\n\nShould his Regent allow it, His Majesty Grover VI shall be crowned in Griffonstone upon his eighteenth birthday in 1021."

 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger In The Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."

 # Industrial story events
 bronzehill_industrial.1.t:0 "The Ravensburg Dam"
 bronzehill_industrial.1.d:0 "For years, the dogs of Ravensburg had waited for this moment. The great dam near the city had finally been finished, half a year behind schedule. However, for now the dogs and griffons of Ravensburg celebrated the opening with large fair. Under pompous fanfare, Count Ignatius cut the red band and ceremoniously gave the signal to start operations.\n\nThe next days, the news all over the country reported about the event. Woofrey Pawner was standing in front of a kiosk and read through the headlines: "Industrial Park operational! Huge Progress for Ravensburg!" (Bronzekreuzer Bote) - "Ravensburg's Industrial Park at work! New opportunities available" (Bronzehügeler Wirtschaftswoche) - "Ravensburg dam opened! How will this affect Bronzehill?" (Harmonisches Morgenblatt) - "New Industries in Ravensburg - but all from Griffenheim" (Nationaler Beobachter) - "Count Ignatius' newest scheme in operation. But will it help him?" (Der Arbeiter). He shook his head. How could they all have so different opinions on the matter? He decided that these scribblers weren't worth this money and moved on.\n\nFar away, in an office in Griffenheim, several griffons toasted on the new project. They hadn't found it necessary to personally travel to Bronzehill, but they surely loved the thought about how many idols would flow into their deep pockets."
 bronzehill_industrial.1.a:0 "Is this our future?"
 
 bronzehill_industrial.2.t:0 "An Argument In The Family"
 bronzehill_industrial.2.d:0 "The door burst open and an angry looking Barnaby galloped into Ignatius' office. The Count looked up, calmly, but with a stern look on his face upon the sudden interruption.\n\n"Father, have you really signed EVEN MORE contracts with that maar-damned Krähe-Stahl?" The Crown Prince fixated his father with his eyes, his anger and disappointment clearly visible. "Bronzehill is becoming more and more a colony of these businessgriffs! Do you really think that the people will not notice? All the major parties condemned how the Grover V Industrial Park was organized, and here you are doing more of the same?"\n\nIgnatius let out a sigh. "My dear son and crown prince, even you are not allowed to burst into my office and yell at me. If I do something, I usually have a good reason for it. But I see from your look that perhaps you haven't gotten it." Ignatius pointed to a chair in front of the desk. "So, please, sit down and listen. You will eventually come to rule this country, and so I should indeed explain this to you. Bronzehill's economy isn't doing well. You perhaps do not know the old prosperity, in the times of before the revolution tore everything asunder. Back then, Bronzehill was the blast furnace of the empire, with the forges of the dogs delivering the finest metals to every corner of it. The Bronzehillian economy was in excellent shape, one of the best of in these times. Then came the revolution, and everything fell apart. But these companies are interested in Bronzehill's ores. They want Bronzehill to once more become the forge of the empire, or what is left of it. We desperately need these investments. I will not bow to some dogs from the streets that seem to know everything better."\n\nBarnaby said nothing for a while, but he shook his head. "I can tell you, father, the dogs from the streets have more power than you assume.""

 # Introduction story events
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.t:0 "The Chairdogship"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius and crown prince Barnaby sat together in the drawing room of Bronzekreuz Castle. It was an underground room in the castle, only dimly lit by the chandaliers on the ceiling.\n\n"Barnaby, my son, as you are probably aware, I have decided to call the Bronzehill council. The crisis that has overtaken Griffenheim has severely impacted us as well. Our nation mournes, as do we, therefore it is neccessary to show unity." Barnaby wagged his tail in approval. "But this is not enough. I have also decided that you, my prince, should get the chairdogship in the council. It is only good if the people see you take responsibility, and I think, you are ready for it."\n\n"I see what you mean. At your will, I will lead the council and look for that the council has only the best interest of Bronzehill in mind. Have you decided yet whom to invite?"\n\nA servant brought in a plate of meatballs. Ignatius and Barnaby ate silently for a while, before Ignatius answered:"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.a:0 ""No. I will need to arrange some meetings.""
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.t:0 "The Old Reformer"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.d:0 "Ignatius decided that he should meet with Winston Copperhill. Though he did not share his son's enthusiasm for the veteran, or Copperhill's distaste for Griffenheim businessgriffs, his career record and accomplishments were not easily disregarded. Thus they sat together at one of the Bronzekreuz clubs, far from anydog's curious ears, sharing a plate of ham and strong Hindian tea between them. "How glad I am you found time for me, Copperhill. How are the pups doing?"\n\n"You haven't invited me here to discuss our children, nor for old war stories, Ignatius. Clearly there is something of greater importance going on, and since I am a busy dog, we should get to it at once." As usual, Winston had little appreciation for decorum, small talk, and wasting time, which the Count could certainly appreciate.\n\n"Very well then. Obviously you heard of it by now — the Emperor has passed away, just as we believed he was about to recover." It still tugged at the heartstrings. "You know what happened last time, you were there and seen it all for yourself. We owe our freedom to griffons, and we'll do anything to keep it that way. To pre-empt any sort of potential instability, I have decided to convene the Bronzehill Council, and you should be present there, though I might not agree if you decide to bring along some friends." Copperhill was hardly a firebrand, but some in his clique were not to Ignatius' sensibilities.\n\nCopperhill kept his expression deliberately impassive, taking a considerable time with the tea. At last, he spoke: "You'll understand if I do not turn out to be your enthusiastic supporter, but I'll gladly accept your invitation. The Emperor's passage has been a... difficult time for everydog, but we cannot mourn forever. This is a great opportunity to enact some positive changes not just for Bronzehill, but for the Empire at wide." Surprisingly optimistic for the old dog, but he wasn't willing to acquiesce just yet. After some further discussion, Copperhill had given the Count some names to consider. Ignatius did not mention that Barnaby would be the chairdog, and since Copperhill had not mentioned it either, chances were good he already knew."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.a:0 "How much reform does Bronzehill need, and how much would break it?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.t:0 "An Usual Guest"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.d:0 "Bronzekreuz Castle may not have been the biggest castle, but it surely had its fair share of secrets. Barnaby had spent much of his youth exploring the secret rooms you could find in the underground parts of the castle, and now it came in useful for a quite serious purpose. He had invited a usual guest into the castle, and they both had agreed that their conversation should better remain private. And so, in one of the hidden meeting rooms, Barnaby and Rosey Luxembark sat on old chairs around an even older table.\n\nRosey Luxembark decided to open. "I honestly have to say, this invitation was something I did not expect. And I guess your father would also not expect it?" Barnaby gave a slow nod. "He has not exactly the best opinion on the SPB, I would say." She let out a chuckle.\n\n"He has not, indeed. But this is more important than just his opinion. The workers deserve representation."\n\n"For a price, I assume?"\n\n"To respect the Council would already be quite a good price, I think." Barnaby sighed. "But this is indeed not all. As you can probably imagine, Loudbark will be on the council as well. He and his militarists are a clear danger to our Bronzehill."\n\nLuxembark took a while to answer, weighing her option. "I can help with that, indeed." She let out another chuckle. "I guess it will be quite the shock for the Count when you present him this idea. Anyways, let me give you some names of people you can trust." She fumbled in her briefcase. "Woofkin, yes, Liebarknecht, as well. Not Barking-Sun. Maybe Tählpoodles?" Her words got lost while she was scribbling all over a sheet of paper.\n\nTwo hours later, Barnaby had good knowledge of most upper SPB party members. Luxembark had told some jokes of inside the party, almost forgetting whom she was speaking to. But their plan was clear - now it was on the Crown Prince to convince his father."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.a:0 "Barnaby and Luxembark parted in good spirit."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.t:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.d:0 "It was quite unusual for the Count of Bronzehill to visit the barracks in Barkgenz, but Rufus Loudbark had ensured him that there they would find an opportunity to speak in private, for their meetup might be seen as controversial for the more moderate minded dog. Thus the gruff soldier led Ignatius to a nearby bunker, which was positively austere compared to his usual surroundings, but he wasn't going to complain about it. He would have raised a word about his deputy's presence, but Loudbark reassured the Count that Lassie would keep things confidential.\n\nHuddled together in a small room, Loudbark wasted little time with his usual diatribe. "I was most surprised, quite so, when I learned you wished to meet with me, my Count. Have you finally seen the folly of your ways? Have the Griffenheim vultures filched enough marrow from common dogs' bones? Grover is dead, and you know what will happen next. Unrest and insecurity, and poor Bronzehill stuck in the middle of it, with few options for itself." The deputy nodded enthusiastically to everything he said like an excited pup.\n\nIgnatius, however, had to resist the urge to smack himself in the face with both paws. "That's quite enough, Rufus. While your rhetoric might work on somedog more simpleminded, I've been singlepawedly keeping the terms of our agreement with the griffons as fair as they possibly can be." Not to say that they weren't demanding at times. "But you are right about the other thing. There must not be a repeat of 978, and to that end I think the National Union deserves a fair representation in the Bronzehill Council. We might not agree on everything, but especially now everydog must stand together."\n\nHe could almost see the gears turning in Loudbark's head. Accept and gain some actual influence in decision making, or refuse to play the eternal populist complaining from the sides? It didn't take very long. "You can't blame me for trying. We'll be joining you at the Council.""
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.a:0 "Is militarism really an answer?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.t:0 "Up In The Hills"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.d:0 "The shack looked exactly how he remembered it, poor, dirty and generally in disrepair. How many years had it been? At least four, maybe five. Kimball Barking-Sun looked at his old home, here in the village he was born in. Kaza-Narag was not a special village, just one of many coal mining villages in the upper mountains of Bronzehill. Once a week large trucks arrived to carry away the coal mined, in exchange for food and other necessities. But they were never generous. How was this not slavery? Had they even escaped the mountain tyrant, the slaver of Diamond Mountain, or had they just exchanged his rule for that of his minions?\n\nBut Barking-Sun was not here for nostalgia. No, pressing issues were on the agenda. An opportunity how it could only ever happen once a century had opened. From his spies, he had learned of the meeting between Luxembark and the crown prince, with some juicy information about her opinions on other party members. If Ignatius would dismiss Barnaby's proposal - which he would do, as minion of the mountain tyrant - he would finally find his opening to oust her as chairdog of the SPB and wrangle control of the party for himself. And then, the real task begun. Finally, the old wrong could be corrected, the misfortune of Grover II overcome. And if everything would go according to his plan, the rule of the mountain tyrant could finally be ended for good, four Grovers later than it should have been.\n\nBut for all these lofty plans, he needed the support of the mining dogs. They knew him, and they trusted him. He had worked for years here, besides them, and he knew what steered them. Things would need to start moving, for if this change was missed, how long would it be before another one would present itself?"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.a:0 "Grover VI is our only hope in this world."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.t:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.d:0 ""Grandmaster Lucky! The Temple of Boreas welcomes you."\n\nPrelate Gunhild led the Knight to a sidedoor of the temple, behind which she had her personal rooms. A young griffon brought in a plate of snacks, after which she waved him out of the room.\n\n"Lucky, my pious friend, you should visit me more often. Are your knights doing alright? They are strong in their belief, standing for faith and Empire."\n\nShe surely would have continued like this for a while, but Lucky cut her off. "Prelate Gunhild, I admire how you always find the right words. But we should come to the matter of this meeting." Always straight to the point. "The socialists have proven more and more emboldend. The Count is double-minded here, sometimes trying to put them down but at other times he lets them get away with their godless posturing. And the Crown Prince is even worse."\n\n"Ignatius is a good person, but his faith is weak. He doesn't trust the Archonate as much as he should. Have I not told him long ago that these socialists needed to be dealt with properly?" She clapped her beak in disappointment. "Perhaps we need to make our support more known to him."\n\n"You are correct, as you always are. I will ready my knights to secure our dear Bronzehill from the unbelievers.""
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.a:0 "Can we trust the clergy in times of need?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.t:0 "Finishing The List"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.d:0 "Like a few weeks prior, Ignatius and Barnaby sat in the drawing room of Bronzehill Castle. Before them was a long list, the collection of potential councillors. While the Count reserved himself the right to make the final call, he wanted to see what priorities his son would set, and so they vividly discussed each of the candidates. Most of the nobles on the list were set; they were too indispensable and pass over them would just be a political faux pass. Yet, with the political figures on the list, the choices weren't so clear. Both Copperhill and Loudbark had provided a number of candidates that they claimed to deserve a seat, but some of these names would need to be cut to not give the politicians to much power in the council.\n\nAs they argued, Barnaby also had a different thought in mind. It seemed almost inevitable that both the HKP and the NU would end up with the same number of councillors, just to save political face. And here he would need to argue to his father, as he knew that Ignatius was also weary of Loudbark.\n\n"I want to bring a different idea on the table. I know that we are both concerned that Loudbark could sway the council into making decisions that... would be unpleasant to work with. But what if we brought in another candidate? Like Luxembark?" The Count's ears pinned back upon hearing that name, but he didn't say anything. "Including her and maybe one or two of her friends would make controlling Loudbark easier. And it would also serve as a much needed guesture to the working dogs of Bronzehill, that we have not forgotten they exist."\n\nBarnaby tried his best to tempt Ignatius to consider the idea, but his father just fixated him with his eyes. After a while, Barnaby ran out of ideas of what to tell, and so they remained silent for a minute. He knew that the answer would be the final one."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.a:0 ""I might personally dislike her, but you have a point.""
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.b:0 ""No, Barnaby, not in a thousand years. The socialists are our enemy, remember that.""
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.b_tooltip:0 "§RThis will radicalize the SPB, making Barking-Sun the new chairdog.§!"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.8.t:0 "A Special Meeting Of The SPB Leader Board"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.8.d:0 "This was not going to end well.\n\nBarking-Sun had called a special meeting of the SPB leader board, to "discuss recent behaviour of certain members". Rosey Luxembark could already tell that somehow her meeting with the Crown Prince had become public - the question just remained how bad it would be. She had already regretted having spilled the beans to much in front of Barnaby. The constant party discussion had just gone on her nerves recently.\n\n"It has come to my knowledge that our chairdog, Comrade Luxembark, has had a meeting with Crown Prince Barnaby.", Barking-Sun opened. "During this meeting, she apparently felt confident to tell the young prince a variety of things. My informant has given me a list of remarks that she made with regards to our much valued comrades." He led out a smirk. "But this is not all. Furthermore, I was informed that Prince Barnaby had offered her a place in the Bronzehill Council, for the price that she would order us to stop distributing 'inflammatory material'. I would like to ask you all, is that the behaviour of a good chairdog? Is that what loyalty to our movement looks like?"\n\nThe meeting went on for a bit. Luxembark tried to defend her meeting with Barnaby as best as she could, while dismissing the "remarks" that Barking-Sun had found out about as baseless slander. However, in the end, she saw no other chance then to call a leadership vote, otherwise the party would never unite behind her anymore. As could be expected, her rival decided to challenge her in that vote.\n\nAnd with a margin of 7-5 votes, the party leadership board voted in favour of Barking-Sun. Luxembark announced her resignation and, in a very formal voice, offered her congratutations to him."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.8.a:0 "Barking-Sun took the stage with a wide smile."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.9.t:0 "The Council Votes"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.9.d:0 "All things were ready. The list of councillors had been finalized, the invitations send out, and now the Bronzehill Council could open with a speech from Count Ignatius. His speach was measured, asking the dogs to show unity in these trying times. Then he introduced his son and Crown Prince as the chairdog of the council, before closing with a minute's silence for Grover V. In his mind, things would fall into place soon. The council would make a statement in support of Griffenheim, discuss maybe minor details and then dissolve again.\n\nHowever, the world is full of surprises. And this surprise came from none other than the Count's own son.\n\n"In the light of recent developments, I would like to discuss with you the extend of Bronzehill's responsibilities to the Griffonstone dynasty in general and Grover VI in particular. As history has proven, regencies are a difficult time for any empire. The developments that led to the catastrophy of 978 were, in part, caused by the disloyalty of Griffenheim's noblegriffs to their - and our - rightful emperor." Barnaby looked around attentively, focussing the councillors with his eyes. "We might therefore need to take a more active approach in guranteeing that history will not repeat itself. And as I can proudly add, Bronzehill's loyalty to the Griffenstone dynasty is beyond any doubt."\n\nWhat followed was a vivid discussion on these contentious claims. Count Ignatius could only watch in horror as Winston Copperhill, Rufus Loudbark and Rosey Luxembark, together with their associates, all argued in favour of what was quickly named a "Bronzehill Regency". And as Barnaby announced a vote on the motion, it passed with the combined support of all three faction. What was he to make of this?"

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.10.d:0 ""Barnaby, we need to talk." His son already led his tail hang. "I am disappointed in you. It is very clear to me, that you knew that this motion would not find my support, and so have started it without my approval. I don’t think that you can imagine what you have unleashed on Bronzehill." Barnaby wanted to give an answer, but a stern look from Ignatius cut him off. "Before you answer anything, I will tell you that I still not approve of the motion. It will be overruled by decree of the Count. The Council will of course complain. But there is no other way now.\n\nWhile the Crown Prince looked miserable, he still tried to give an answer. "My father, I respect your decision. You are the Count. But I want to say at least that the forces I ostensibly unleashed were already there. Many of our institutions are weary of how our relationship with Griffenheim works. And who tells us that it will not end in another catastrophe?"\n\n"I can tell you, it will not. The Griffenheim court is different from how it was 50 years ago. They will figure something out. Our place is to serve the emperor, not trying to overthrow is regent in a useless endeavour."\n\nThe next day, Count Ignatius gave a statement to the Bronzehill Council. It was rather short, informing the council that the last vote would be overturned by the Count’s veto. The reactions were, as expected, quite hostile. They would be needed to be dealt with."

Simultaneously, subversive elements in the army derailed an early response plan, while all across the country the mining dogs formed militias to patrol the streets.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the Bronzetail family was tipped off and had decided to spend the days in the summer residence near Bellen. While their estate was quickly assaulted and taken, the Count and his family had already fled into the woods.\n\nAt ten o’clock, a radio message from Barking-Sun could be heard on all channels. “Dogs of Bronzehill! I am speaking to you from Bronzekreuz to tell you that our comrades from the SPB have taken over the government. While the reaction will try to dislodge this act of revolution, we will stand our ground and fight.

"News from Griffenheim... someone... someone..." the dog couldn't say more and Ignatius slowly took the letter, staring at the short message. He blinked, unable to understand the words at first. He read it over and over, as if it was written in a different language, but soon the paper fell from his paw. A... a coup? And the crown prince had been...\n\nHe unsteadily stood up, stumbling away form his desk. It couldn't be, that letter had to be wrong... it couldn't be! Not that too! Not that too! He screamed, howling in despair as he slammed his paws against the wall, pounding it furiously as he slowly sank down to his knees, whining incoherently. He didn't even comprehend what was going on as two guards came into the room, pulling him away from the wall as he kept slamming his now bleeding paws into it, nor could he understand them when they tried to reach through to him.\n\nIn the end, Count Ignatius was dragged out of his office and brought to the hospital, even as the news spread from the palace to the city and from the city to the country. Not enough that the emperor was dead, someone had murdered his son as well. The lineage of Grover, their savior, has gone, it was snuffed out, and in its place the military had taken control over in Griffenheim."

[BRZ.GetLeader] went so far as to suggest that Bronzehill should take the regency, claiming that the only beings who could truly rule the Empire justly in the name of the Emperor are those whose loyalty to the Emperor is unquestionable.\n\nGriffenheim and Strawberry have denounced the move as a great betrayal to the Empire."

Heavy casualties were mounting for the dogs as they did mass berserker charges against machine gun emplacements, however their ferociousness terrified Imperial soldiers with some deserting. Eventually, the dogs were able to penetrate deeper in the city thanks to continued artillery and air support. The dogs soon advanced from the outskirts to the center of the city until they reached the palace where the Imperial Guard fought ferociously before being killed thanks to the Guard refusing surrender. After the palace was taken, the dogs cheered as they secured the Emperor from the clutches of the Imperials holding him under their regency. Soon after, the remaining soldiers surrendered in mass in order to avoid their own deaths and were given fair treatment after the battle ended."

Eventually whatever remnants soon evacuated the city in small groups or deserted the frontlines from the harsh bloodshed and futility of fighting. In the end, the city was taken with heavy casualties by Bronzehill troops and was in ruins as well.

 BRZ_count_ignatius_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th December 965, Sandstone House, Bronzehill\n\n§YBiography§!: Count Ignatius has ruled Bronzehill since the death of his father Count Georgie in 997. When he was five years old, he travelled to the Imperial City to see Grover V's coronation and was enamoured by the splendour. He returned to the city many times and studied there at Emperor's College, gaining a degree in politics.\n\nHe became a close friend of the Emperor, who attended his wedding to Izzy Bones-Iron, daughter of the Lord Gems. With her he has had two children, Barnaby and Margaret.\n\nDuring his rule he has been a competent administrator and a beloved defender of Bronzehill and the Emperor, however his policies on supporting Griffon industry over Bronzehill's own has led to the formation of several communist organisations in Bronzehill. And while he has the full support of the Bronze Council, there are those who question his ability to lead effectively should Bronzehill be faced by a disaster such as the Republican Uprising during his father's reign.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 BRZ_BARKINGSUN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th April 973, Kaza-Narag, Bronzehill.\n\n§YBiography§!: Kimball Barking-Sun was born in the poor coal-mining village of Kaza-Narag (literally \"Black Cave\"). His village was Dogish-speaking, something which is looked down upon in wider Bronzehill, and he recieved only token education as a child. At the age of 14 years, he started to work in the coal mines, where he formulated his ideology, based on a combination of folk stories and communist agitation which had spread into the mines. After joining a underground trade union, he learned to read and write in secret, while also becoming a local agitator and organizator.\n\nBarking-Suns political believes, especially with respect to the Griffonstone dynasty, are controversial among not only the wider socialist community (which rejects many of his views outright), but even inside of the Socialist Party of Bronzehill. However, through dedication and hard work, he has won his place in the party - and after overthrowing the \"liberal\" Luxembark, he can finally put his theory into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

Her family had liberal political believes and promoted a universal education, with her learning literature from an early age. Her father used his modest prosperity to enable Rosey and her five brothers to study in the prestigious universities of southern Herzland. Rosey enrolled to study economics, engineering, sociology and biology.\n\nDuring her studies, she became a socialist writer. She then decided to switch to study law, to work as lawyer and journalist for the socialist movement. Back in Bronzehill, she was a founding member of the Socialist Party, becoming its second chairman after August Barken. Among fellow socialists, her pro-monarchy views are a continuous topic of controversy, especially her idea of \"institutional continuity\" for achieving true communism. However, few griffons and dogs of Herzland can deny her commitment to the workers movement, democratic reform and socialist theory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

He quickly rose through the party ranks due to his oratory skill. After becomeing its chairdog in 1004, he has extended the party's platform and promoted the populist Lassie Goldcoat to be his deputy, appealing also to rural and nationalist dogs.

He was often controversial with his desire for social reform and his support of local Bronzehill businesses over Imperial ones. He was a founding member of the Harmonic Conservative Party and sort to bring greater representation of the common hound into the Bronze Council.\n\nDuring the Republican Uprising he was temporary promoted to Oberstleutnant, although did not participate in the fight to restore the Emperor to the throne. The event however convinced him that the only way to ensure the safety of the Emperor is to make Bronzehill strong and ready to fight. A rallying call that has put him at odds with many even in his own party. But his stubbornness and oratory talent have kept him at the forefront of politics.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Flake"
