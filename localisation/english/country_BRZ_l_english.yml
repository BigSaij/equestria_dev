# General remarks for writers: 
# Please use International (Standard/Oxford) English, also called British English. Please do not use American English.
# As Bronzehill is a Herzlander (German) speaking nation, you might want to use some German words for flavour or immersion. Please do this rarely and only for single words that represent important concepts (examples: Volksreligion (= People's religion) for Luxembark or Wehrsportspiele (=Military/Defence sport games) for Loudbark). If you do not speak German, ping HerrB on discord to help you out.
# Some parts of Bronzehill speak also Dogish (Khuzdul). However, Dogish words should only be used exceptionally rarely, if at all. Please ping HerrB on discord to confirm that the lore fits. Please remember that Dogish is a minority language even among the dogs of Bronzehill, only spoken by ~25% of the population, with ~95% (also) speaking Herzlander.
# Thank you! - HerrB

 # Starting
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Finish The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_finish_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The \"Grover V Industrial Park\" is the name given to large industrial park near Ravensburg. It is almost ready to be opened, but the dam to generate the electricity had been plagued by problems for the last month. It is time to put in the effort and finish this."
 
 BRZ_paving_the_roads:0 "Paving The Roads"
 BRZ_paving_the_roads_desc:0 "Now that the new industrial park is open, we have to make the most out of it. The roads around Ravensburg could use some better paving, so that goods can flow in and out of the industrial park. We will get to work."
 
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers:0 "Invite Griffenheim Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_griffenheim_engineers_desc:0 "While the Grover V Industrial Park surely is a good investment, we need to be prepared for any future trouble. We will invite engineers from Griffenheim to work and live in Ravensburg, so that we can keep the park operational if a catastrophy like 978 would shake the empire again."
 
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Contracts With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_contracts_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "Why should we stop here? With the Grover V Industrial Park starting to be a success story, this can only mean good things for the Bronzehill economy. Our dear Count Ignatius will sign even more contracts will companies from Griffenheim."

 # Autonomist side
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Nationalize The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_nationalize_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "It was utter insanity to allow the park to be operated in the way it was. Herzlander companies bought out more and more of the Bronzehillian economy, and our government only watched it happen. We will fix that, starting with the park itself."
 
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production:0 "Increase Domestic Food Production"
 BRZ_increase_domestic_food_production_desc:0 "In the past, most of Bronzehill's food was imported from wider Herzland, as we focused on mining and refining ores. With our trade relationships with other Herzland nations souring in the wake of our new political situation, we need to increase domestic production."
 
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy:0 "Diversify Bronzehill's Economy"
 BRZ_diversify_bronzehills_economy_desc:0 "Our economy needs to be able to stand more autonomous. It is not enough for us to focus on iron and steel anymore, if we can't reliably trade it for other goods. Our focus should be to diversify our industry, and luckily for us, the now nationalized Grover V industrial park can be used to do that."
 
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net:0 "Build A Social Safety Net"
 BRZ_build_a_social_safety_net_desc:0 "There is still a lingering economic crisis in Bronzehill, and many dogs still are destitute. Our help to these dogs will be doubly beneficial: Not only will we get more better fed, thus more productive workers, but also increased domestic demand, something that will help our economy to prosper again."
 
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust:0 "The Bronzehill Steel Trust"
 BRZ_the_bronzehill_steel_trust_desc:0 "There are many steel producers in Bronzehill, and not a small amount of them are either still in the claws of businessgriffs or freshly nationalized. Yet, they are struggling as our exports are not doing great. Unifying them into a steel trust, the "Vereinigte Stahlwerke", will help us profit from our steel again."
 
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
 BRZ_nationalize_key_industries_desc:0 "Much of our steel industry is still held by private investors, both domestic and foreign. This can no longer stand! The workers demand that we give them control, so that the rich capitalists profit of their work no longer. Instead, the steel industry will be combined into the "Kombinat Kaza-Gull"."
 
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds:0 "Increase Engineering Funds"
 BRZ_increase_engineering_funds_desc:0 "Our domestic production still suffers from a lack of industrial engineers. Our production methods are outdated, our industrial sectors run off old machinery and our output is trailing other nations in Herzland. Giving new funds to train and attract engineers can only help us here."
 
 BRZ_underground_factories:0 "Underground Factories"
 BRZ_underground_factories_desc:0 "Diamond dogs have a long history of living underground. While we in Bronzehill have partially adapted to the griffon way of live, we still can use the plenty of caves to create more room for factories. Coincidentally, these factories are also quite well protected against bombs from the air."
 
 BRZ_economic_planning_office:0 "Economic Planning Office"
 BRZ_economic_planning_office_desc:0 "For Bronzehill to have a strong and stable domestic industrial sector, we need to invest in proper management and planning. With the right ideas of land use, we can fetch some more factory locations from our limited lands."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_strong_and_free:0 "Bronzehill Strong And Free"
 BRZ_bronzehill_strong_and_free_desc:0 "With the reforms to our industry, we can proudly proclaim that Bronzehill no longer needs to hide about its industrial progress. Proudly we march into the future, free from foreign influence, strong from our own work."
 
 # Shared
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget:0 "Expand The Rural School Budget"
 BRZ_expand_the_rural_school_budget_desc:0 "Our education system still doesn't reach many of the small villages in Bronzehill, particularly in the mountains. Already under Count Georgie, the Rural School Program was initiated to alleviate the situation. Even though things have improved, the program still suffers from insufficient funding and a lack of teachers. It's high time to change that."
 
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers:0 "Invite Electronic Engineers"
 BRZ_invite_electronic_engineers_desc:0 "One area where Bronzehill is particularly lacking is in the new and coming sector of electronics. If we want to improve our research, we need more talent in this sector."
 
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home:0 "Our Talents At Home"
 BRZ_our_talents_at_home_desc:0 "It would be wrong to entirely ignore what talent we already have at home. We are Diamond Dogs, not Griffons, and we should make use of what we are good at. New specialists should research about our own abilities, so that we can use them best."
 
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Found The Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_found_the_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "Bronzehill is so poor in scientist, that we don't even have our own domestic university. But with the recent influx of talent, attracted by our various programs, we finally have everything together to found our very own university for research and education, here in our capital."
 
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system:0 "Modernize The Education System"
 BRZ_modernize_the_education_system_desc:0 "Our education system still suffers from being outdated on various topics. With new capacities to educate teachers here in Bronzehill, we should make sure that these teachers have all the tools they need and a up-to-date curriculum at paw."
 
 # Loyalty side
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl:0 "Negotiations With Krähe-Stahl"
 BRZ_negotiations_with_kraehe_stahl_desc:0 "Now that the political situation is somewhat under control, we can resume our long task of resolving Bronzehill's economic crisis. A first step in this is to negotiate with Krähe-Stahl, one of the main operators of the Grover V Industrial Park."
 
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system:0 "Liberalize The Banking System"
 BRZ_liberalize_the_banking_system_desc:0 "Bronzehill needs investment; there can be little doubt about that. To further our economic development, we will liberalize certain laws regarding credits and securities... hopefully this will convince some banks that we are worth an investment."
 
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth:0 "Give Support To Goldtooth"
 BRZ_give_support_to_goldtooth_desc:0 "Max Goldtooth is one of the richest, if not the richest griffons in Bronzehill. Of course he is from Griffenheim and some dogs loath him for that. But he has built a large industrial conglomerate here, has invested more than a claw full of idols into the industrial district and most importantly, he is living in Bronzekreuz. Supporting his enterprises is good for us all."
 
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength:0 "Utilize Our Strength"
 BRZ_utilize_our_strength_desc:0 "Invest in your strength, and supplant your weaknesses, this should be our motto. Yes, we dogs are not as skilled in agriculture as other species might be, but we all the more skilled in our mining business that we are famous for. Let us use that."
 
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry:0 "Industrial Cooperation With Strawberry"
 BRZ_industrial_cooperation_with_strawberry_desc:0 "In our new position, Strawberry is getting ever more important as trading partner. Several of their investors have shown interest in forming a group to organize their investment in Bronzehill. This is something we should further, so that our economy can profit."
 
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus:0 "Krähe-Stahl Bronzehill"
 BRZ_kraehe_stahl_bronzehill_focus_desc:0 "Krähe-Stahl, the famous industrial conglomerate from Griffenheim, has agreed to officially open a branch office in Bronzekreuz. We will grant them large economic freedoms in exchange for steady investment."
 
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park:0 "Expand The Grover V Industrial Park"
 BRZ_expand_the_grover_v_industrial_park_desc:0 "The Grover V Industrial Park might have had a slow start, but it is now showing definite signs of success. The hydroelectric power from the Ravensburg dam is used almost completely, but this cannot stop us. We will expand the park by building new power plants."
 
 BRZ_foreign_investment_management_bureau:0 "Foreign Investment Management Bureau"
 BRZ_foreign_investment_management_bureau_desc:0 "The influx of foreign investment into Bronzehill is certainly helping us out quite a lot. But we need to keep track of who does what and for which purpose, otherwise we will end in economic chaos. Also, the investors still need to pay taxes to us."
 
 BRZ_urbanize_the_south:0 "Urbanize The South"
 BRZ_urbanize_the_south_desc:0 "The fertile strip of land in our south, from Hundsfeld to Ravensburg, is starting to become the economic lifeblood of Bronzehill. This is good, and we should encourage it, therefore we should expand the cities in the area."
 
 BRZ_prospering_together:0 "Prospering Together"
 BRZ_prospering_together_desc:0 "Bronzehill doesn't stand alone in Herzland, but is part of a vast network of trade routes and mutual investments. Good, we say! We shall prosper together with the rest of Herzland, just as all dogs within our nation also shall prosper together."
 
 BRZ_drill_for_oil_under_crownspike:0 "Drill For Oil Under Crownspike"
 BRZ_drill_for_oil_under_crownspike_desc:0 "Some unusual scents have been picked up by the noses of our skilled prospectors. While we are mostly concerned with gems and ores, this time we have struck oil. And in a changing industrial environment, oil is the new, black gold."
 
 ## Military Initial
 
 BRZ_military_budget_review:0 "Review The Military Budget"
 BRZ_military_budget_review_desc:0 "The current crisis in the Empire has the potential to cause strife, if not outright war. While Bronzehill has traditionally maintained only a small army, the coming times could force us to change our approach quite drastically."
 
 BRZ_home_defence:0 "Home Defence"
 BRZ_home_defence_desc:0 "If Bronzehill should really get involved in a future war, we need to focus on defending our homes from the invaders. Let us prepare defensive plans on how we could stall any possible invading force."
 
 BRZ_western_defence_line:0 "Western Defence Line"
 BRZ_western_defence_line_desc:0 "The first step in our plan to protect Bronzehill is to build a defensive line running north to south, protecting Bronzekreuz and the lands behind it. The northern mountains would be used for defence, otherwise we will build behind the river."
 
 BRZ_southern_defence_line:0 "Southern Defence Line"
 BRZ_southern_defence_line_desc:0 "The southern defence line is for the worst case scenario – an attack from Griffenheim. Luckily, we can make use of the natural lakes and rivers, running a defence line from Pfotenhausen in the West through Hundsfeld and Ravensburg until we hit the Hellquillian border on the east."
 
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies:0 "Protecting Our Skies"
 BRZ_protecting_our_skies_desc:0 "The cruelties of air warfare are beginning to show themselves in the conflicts we hear about in the wider world. As we know that many nations that surround us are also building an air fleet, we need to invest in counter measures."
 
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat:0 "The Mountain Retreat"
 BRZ_the_mountain_retreat_desc:0 "We dogs are people of the mountains. While many of our cities are built above the ground, every dog can still go underground if we need to. If our situation becomes really desperate, we can decide to move our administration away from the southern flatlands into the mountain, evacuating as many dogs and griffons as possible."
 
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy:0 "Challenge Our Legacy"
 BRZ_challenge_our_legacy_desc:0 "The population of Bronzehill has always viewed war with horror. Violent behaviour was associated with the crimes of the Diamond Mountain slavers, something that was shunned in Bronzehill. However, we need to remind the dogs that someday the Emperor could call us to arms again – then we should not cower away."
 
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill:0 "The Army Of Bronzehill"
 BRZ_army_of_bronzehill_desc:0 "We need to review the state of our current land forces. Their equipment is as outdated as their fighting tactics – we have a long way to go before our army is truly ready for combat."
 
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns:0 "Modernize Our Guns"
 BRZ_modernize_our_guns_desc:0 "The army of Bronzehill still operates with many old guns. We should do a concentrated effort to develop newer, more powerful guns, otherwise we will fall behind in combat capability."
 
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion:0 "Cannons Are Our Passion"
 BRZ_cannons_are_our_passion_desc:0 "Bronzehill is famous for its metals, and not too long ago, was also one of the prime producers of cannons for the empire. Yet, we have rarely used these guns for ourselves, nor have we produced them as much since the revolution. But we should get back on track."
 
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain:0 "Our Natural Terrain"
 BRZ_our_natural_terrain_desc:0 "As diamond dogs, we live in the mountains – literally in the mountains sometimes. As such, we have developed a very fine sense of how to operate here. If our enemies can't counter this, we should use it."
 
 BRZ_proper_support_for_our_troops:0 "Proper Support For Our Troops"
 BRZ_proper_support_for_our_troops_desc:0 "With storm troops alone we won't be able to overcome the enemy. Our divisions also need various supporting elements, like engineers, field hospitals or reconnaissance. We should focus on including these in our division, to maximize efficiency."
 
 BRZ_cannons_on_wheels:0 "Cannons On Wheels"
 BRZ_cannons_on_wheels_desc:0 "Other nations have already done it, and we should follow soon: Putting our cannons on top of mightily armoured vehicles. This way, we can have firepower that is much more flexible when approaching the enemy."
 
 BRZ_rework_our_training_routine:0 "Rework Our Training Routine"
 BRZ_rework_our_training_routine_desc:0 "In peace times, it is all too common for our troops to become complacent. And for good reason, for the longest time they were just a better police force. However, now we need well trained, combat-ready soldiers, so we need to intensify our training."
 
 BRZ_update_our_tactics:0 "Update Our Tactics"
 BRZ_update_our_tactics_desc:0 "One of the most crucial things in combat is to employ the right tactics. This mostly comes with experience, however by studying the wars around us in the world, we might still be able to learn quite a bit of useful insight."
 
 BRZ_bronzehills_special_recipe:0 "Bronzehill's Special Recipe"
 BRZ_bronzehills_special_recipe_desc:0 "When the enemies approach our tanks, they will soon notice why we are called diamond dogs. No other species can claim to be so good at treating metals as we are."
 
 BRZ_electronic_support:0 "Electronic Support"
 BRZ_electronic_support_desc:0 "The advancements made in electronics have certainly impacted the way future wars will be fought. The newest invention is the so-called RADAR technology which would help us to spot enemy forces in advance. We should invest in it."
 
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad:0 "A Bronzehill Air Squad"
 BRZ_bronzehill_air_squad_desc:0 "We dogs have not a natural ability to fly like the griffons do, but all the more should we be interested in the developments of airplanes. Let us establish a Bronzehill air squad by procuring a few airplanes from friendly sources in Herzland."
 
 BRZ_upgrade_our_fighters:0 "Upgrade Our Fighters"
 BRZ_upgrade_our_fighters_desc:0 "While we have procured some fighters from abroad, and also have the knowledge of building more, our fighters still don't do well in comparison to what others armies can field. An investment into research on various components will seriously enhance the capabilities of our fighters."
 
 BRZ_bombs_from_above:0 "Bombs From Above"
 BRZ_bombs_from_above_desc:0 "To be able to drop bombs on our enemies from above is an incredibly powerful tool, if used right. We need to further our knowledge on the components involved, so that our enemies may shiver in fear when they see our bombers approach."
 
 BRZ_bronzehills_air_factories:0 "Bronzehill's Air Factories"
 BRZ_bronzehills_air_factories_desc:0 "To further our air force, we need additional capabilities to building more planes. A new industrial project centred on producing planes can deliver what our army needs."
 
 BRZ_dogs_doing_dogfights:0 "Dogs Doing Dogfights"
 BRZ_dogs_doing_dogfights_desc:0 "For some unknown reason, if two pilots fight each other in the air, it is known as a "dog fight". Well, this should spurn us to become the undisputed master of these dog fights, then."
 
 ## Political Initial
 
 # Introduction
 BRZ_call_the_bronzehill_council:0 "Call The Bronzehill Council"
 BRZ_call_the_bronzehill_council_desc:0 "The death of our dear emperor Grover V has caused a major political crisis in Bronzehill. Count Ignatius therefore will convene the Bronzehill Council, to deliberate the way how to go forward."
 
 BRZ_tea_with_copperhill:0 "Tea With Copperhill"
 BRZ_tea_with_copperhill_desc:0 "One of the most prominent politicians in Bronzehill, Lord Winston Copperhill is the leader of the Harmonic-Conservative Party (HKP). As one of the influencial figures in Bronzehill, Count Ignatius wants to meet the Lord in private."
 
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 BRZ_an_unusual_guest_desc:0 "Count Ignatius is not the only one who is interested in potential councillors. Barnaby had an idea of his own, and has invited an unusual guest into Bronzehill Castle, to discuss some things that Ignatius doesn't need to know about - for now at least."
 
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 BRZ_word_with_loudbark_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark is the chairdog of the militarist and populist National Union, and fully lives up to his name. But in this matter, Count Ignatius preferes a more calm environment, for some things need to be discussed discretely."
 
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills:0 "Up In The Hills"
 BRZ_up_in_the_hills_desc:0 "Not all power in Bronzehills comes from the palace. Even though the Count rules absolute, there are plenty of dogs who hold little loyalty to him. And one of them had just found out very interesting details to think about."
 
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 BRZ_meeting_in_ravensburg_desc:0 "The prelate of Bronzehill, located in Ravensburg, is normally only concerned with religious matters. However, in times when the socialist movement openly defies the will of Boreas, it is hard to stay out of politics."
 
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas:0 "Barnaby's Ideas"
 BRZ_barnabys_ideas_desc:0 "The final list of councillors is almost complete. All the political factions in Bronzehill have found their place in the council. Or have they? Crown Prince Barnaby think that Ignatius has forgotten something, but Barnaby has already an idea."
 
 BRZ_the_councils_opens:0 "The Council Opens"
 BRZ_the_councils_opens_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council has been called. Count Ignatius will open the council with a speach to the councillors, and then Prince Barnaby will oversee the deliberation of the council. And at the end, surely, the Council will make a united statement in support of Ignatius and the regent in Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_a_change_of_course:0 "A Change Of Course"
 BRZ_a_change_of_course_desc:0 "We have decided to accept the vote of the Bronzehill Council. Count Ignatius will step back, but now the Bronzehill Council needs to find a way out of the political crisis."
 
 BRZ_old_loyalties:0 "Old Loyalties"
 BRZ_old_loyalties_desc:0 "We have decided to dismiss the vote of the Bronzehill Council. The dogs will prove their loyalty to the emperor not by trying to overthrow his regency, but by fighting along them for the glory of the empire."

 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile:0 "The Regent In Exile"
 BRZ_the_regent_in_exile_desc:0 "Archon Eros VII has become regent in Griffenheim, much to the dismay of the nobility, including Count Ignatius.

 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter:0 "Trip To Readewetter"
 BRZ_trip_to_readewetter_desc:0 "If we want to support Gabriela in overthrowing the Archon and taking the regency, we need to formalize our alliance as soon as possible. Count Ignatius will personally travel to Readewetter to meet Gabriela and to discuss further details."
 
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp:0 "Work With The HKP"
 BRZ_work_with_the_hkp_desc:0 "In contrast to the radicals from the Socialists or the National Union, the Harmonic-Conservatives are not a fundamental thread to Bronzehill. While their reform agenda might be uncomfortable to some, in this situation they are our best bet to coax back some of the support we have lost."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command:0 "Purge The High Command"
 BRZ_purge_the_high_command_desc:0 "The high command has shown a disturbingly close relationship with Loudbark's National Union. In the current political climate, these connections could easily become a thread to our rule. We will retire the worst offenders, while promoting new staff from the loyal nobility."
 
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate:0 "Help From The Prelate"
 BRZ_help_from_the_prelate_desc:0 "Prelate Gunhild is not too happy that we have thrown our support behind Gabriela – as appointee from Eros, she argued in favour of his regency. However, Gunhild knows her position, as well as the current political climate. We will work together to curb the ongoing socialist agitation."
 
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights:0 "Loyalty Of The Knights"
 BRZ_loyalty_of_the_knights_desc:0 "Much like Gunhild, Grandmaster Lucky from the Knights of Bronzekreuz has shown a preference for Eros.

 BRZ_gather_noble_support:0 "Gather Noble Support"
 BRZ_gather_noble_support_desc:0 "The nobles of Bronzehill are the fundament of our rule, now more than ever. Yet a surprising amount of nobles seems to be rather passive, instead of openly supporting the Count. We have to remind them of what is at stake here."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_desc:0 "With our rule secured, we can finally proclaim the crisis to be over and send the councillors home. They have been an obstacle to our goals for long enough."
 
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry:0 "Trade With Strawberry"
 BRZ_trade_with_strawberry_desc:0 "After we have favoured Gabriela over Eros, our trade with Griffenheim has predictably taken a hit. However, our alliance with Strawberry also includes various economic treaties. It is high time we act on these treaties and bring our economy back on track."
 
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts:0 "Renegotiate Industrial Contracts"
 BRZ_renegotiate_industrial_contracts_desc:0 "At the time we negotiated with Krähe-Stahl and other companies from Griffenheim over future investment in Bronzehill, nodog could have seen coming that we would break with Griffenheim. But it has happened, and now we have to secure our economy. We will approach them to renegotiate some of the clauses in our investment pacts."
 
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support:0 "Rebuild Popular Support"
 BRZ_rebuild_popular_support_desc:0 "This whole affair has cost us a fair bit of popular support. But with the political crisis mostly over, we can focus on rebuilding the trust of the common dog."
 
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares:0 "Shuffle Industrial Shares"
 BRZ_shuffle_industrial_shares_desc:0 "Not all companies that we have investment agreements with are from Griffenheim.

 BRZ_in_denfence_of_tradition:0 "In Defence Of Tradition"
 BRZ_in_denfence_of_tradition_desc:0 "It is important to remember for every dog that we fight for a just cause: Against theocratic radicalism and for the trusted rule of the nobility. We will spread the message across Bronzehill, so that every dog can see why we stand against Griffenheim."
 
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors:0 "Invite Yale Professors"
 BRZ_invite_yale_professors_desc:0 "Bronzehill's academia is quite small in comparison to the intellectual centres in Herzland. To improve our research efforts, we will invite griffon professors from Greenback and Yale. If we give out generous grants, hopefully a sufficient number will join us so that our academia gets a noticeable boost."

 BRZ_the_rightful_regent:0 "The Rightful Regent"
 BRZ_the_rightful_regent_desc:0 "Our bonds to Griffenheim will not be shaken, regardless of whom the wise griffons of Grover's court choose as regent. The dogs of Bronzehill are there to serve the emperor, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim:0 "Envoy To Griffenheim"
 BRZ_envoy_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "We have thrown our full support behind the rightful regent, but this does not solve our political crisis at home yet. When we send an official envoy to Griffenheim it will not only show the empire our admiration, but also serve as a warning to our political opponents at home."
 
 BRZ_gather_the_knights:0 "Gather The Knights"
 BRZ_gather_the_knights_desc:0 "Grandmaster Lucky of the Knights of Bronzekreuz has already expressed interest in taking on the problem with the socialists in our country. We have long been hesitant, but in our new situation, we need decisive action. Grandmaster Lucky can deliver that."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility:0 "Unite The Nobility"
 BRZ_unite_the_nobility_desc:0 "We should not forget that a fair few nobles in the council seemed to favour the notion of a Bronzehill regency. But now that the matter is decided, we need to unite the nobles behind us. Division makes us weak in the face of our political opponents that still hide in the shadows."
 
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies:0 "Clear Military Hierachies"
 BRZ_clear_military_hierachies_desc:0 "One of the most pressing issues for us is the loyalty of the army – Loudbark seems to have infiltrated the army rather successfully. We should ask in Griffenheim for some army advisors, which would bolster our command structure and coincidentally also make it secured against a future takeover attempt."
 
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB:0 "Outlaw The SPB"
 BRZ_outlaw_the_SPB_desc:0 "This farce has been going on for long enough. We have tried to handle the socialist movement by making some reforms while banning their more dangerous ideas, yet it has not come to fruition. Now, we will make the hammer come down and outright ban the Socialist Party."
 
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages:0 "Spread Loyalist Messages"
 BRZ_spread_loyalist_messages_desc:0 "Every dog should know that what we aspire to is to help and support the emperor. This is the least common denominator for every dog in Bronzehill, and we will base our propaganda efforts on it. The idea of a Bronzehill-led regency is just crazy-talk by dangerous people."
 
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim:0 "Invite Advisors From Griffenheim"
 BRZ_invite_advisors_from_griffenheim_desc:0 "Bronzehill's industry is still lacking, and the ongoing political crisis has shaken our administration as well. What could be more natural to ask our overlord to help us out? Griffon advisors will make everything easier, while also helping to control any lingering unrest."
 
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist:0 "Dismiss The Council"
 BRZ_dismiss_the_council_loyalist_desc:0 "The crisis is over, finally. The Bronzehill Council has been a thorn in our side instead of being helpful, but now we have gathered enough political strength to send them home. Boreas bless them, and farewell."
 
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity:0 "A True Show Of Unity"
 BRZ_a_true_show_of_unity_desc:0 "The Bronzehill Council was originally intendent to show the united support of the dogs for the emperor. This worked rather mediocre, to be polite. However, with the political crisis over, we are finally ready to unite behind the emperor and his regent. Our bond will never be broken."
 
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs:0 "Most Loyal And Faithful Dogs"
 BRZ_most_loyal_and_faithful_dogs_desc:0 "The newfound unity of the dogs will also make itself known in the army. If we fight, we fight for the emperor, and we will fight proudly under his flag."
 
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim:0 "Reinvigorate Trade With Griffenheim"
 BRZ_reinvigorate_trade_with_griffenheim_desc:0 "Despite our strong bonds, the economic relation with Griffenheim has been lacking lately, mostly due to their own economic troubles. But with the empire slowly getting back on track, our trade relationship should deepen again. If we do it right, Bronzehill's economy will gain a good boost out of this."
 
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park:0 "The Grover V Memorial Park"
 BRZ_the_grover_v_memorial_park_desc:0 "Grover V was truly a great emperor. A grand park in Bronzekreuz will be constructed to honour and remember him. This will both serve as a nice addition to our city, being a place to relax and enjoy, and also as a reminder for all dogs that we are the most loyal subjects of his majesty."
 
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire:0 "The Forge Of The Empire"
 BRZ_the_forge_of_the_empire_desc:0 "In the old times, before it all came crashing down in the revolution, Bronzehill was known as the "Forge of the Empire". We dogs are well versed in how to extract and refine the treasures of the earth, be it metals or gems. While we might have a long way to go before our old glory can be reclaimed, we will make our efforts known."
 
 # Barking-Sun path

 BRZ_barking_suns_coup_desc:0 "With the Bronzehill Council in deadlock, Barking-Sun has finally made his move and overthrown the government with the help of his loyal mining dogs. The Count has fled, but resistance to our rule remains. Our great task begins here."
 
 BRZ_secure_the_army:0 "Secure The Army"
 BRZ_secure_the_army_desc:0 "The Army is the institution most hostile to our new government. But when Barking-Sun can appeal to the mining dogs, he can also sway the common soldier. As for the commanders... we need to destroy the old command structure of the army as quickly as possible, to secure a future for our regime."
 
 BRZ_target_the_national_union:0 "Target The National Union"
 BRZ_target_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is our greatest political enemy. Now that we have taken control of Bronzekreuz, we can finally move to destroy them once and for all. Down with the reaction!"
 
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp:0 "Disband The HKP"
 BRZ_disband_the_hkp_desc:0 "The Harmonic-Conservative Party is a group of weaklings, pseudo-reformers and double-faced reactionaries. Their claims of peace and liberty are lies to deceive the working class, for they want to keep the old oppressors in their lofty positions. Our revolution has made them terrified, and rightfully so: They are the next to go."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge The Nobles"
 BRZ_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have already seen from where the wind is blowing and have abandoned their estates. However, others are fighting in the shadows or openly defy our rule. Here, any temperance would be our downfall, we have to strike fast and hard."
 
 BRZ_hunt_the_count:0 "Hunt The Count"
 BRZ_hunt_the_count_desc:0 "Ignatius, the old Count of Bronzehill, has fled the capital as our revolution broke out. His whereabouts is currently unknown, an unacceptable security risk for our government. We will start a great hunt to either force him to flee our borders or, even better, to have him executed."
 
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy:0 "Mobilize The Economy"
 BRZ_mobilize_the_economy_desc:0 "We have the high goal of marching on Griffenheim and saving Grover VI from his ill advisors and deceptive nobles. However, for that we need guns, cannons and other war material. We will have to fully mobilize the economy of Bronzehill and Barking-Sun has just the right ideas on how to do it."
 
 BRZ_liberation_corps:0 "Liberation Corps"
 BRZ_liberation_corps_desc:0 "The ''Befreiungskorps'' (Liberation Corps) are special units staffed with only the most loyal supporters of Barking-Sun, mostly his old comrades from the mines. They will be essential for conquering Griffenheim. May they live up to their name!"
 
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication:0 "Principle Of Total Dedication"
 BRZ_principle_of_total_dedication_desc:0 "The Principle of total dedication is quite simple: Everything for the emperor. We work, fight and die for him. There can no thought but his liberation on our minds. This is our duty, now and forever."
 
 BRZ_industrial_independence:0 "Industrial Independence"
 BRZ_industrial_independence_desc:0 "The economy of Bronzehill is still entangled in trade with Griffenheim and other parts of Herzland. With nothing but traitors to the emperor surrounding us, we cannot accept this, but we need to work extra hard to ensure our industrial independence."
 
 BRZ_new_academia:0 "New Academia"
 BRZ_new_academia_desc:0 "The academic system of Bronzehill needs a total makeover. We need to focus our research efforts on the things that matter to us, namely how to best defeat the false regent in Griffenheim. Otherwise, we need to cull research that is not on our political line."
 
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy:0 "Barking-Sun's Philosophy"
 BRZ_barking_suns_philosophy_desc:0 "Barking-Sun is not much of an academic writer, but he surely has a clear view of the world. With the help of some academic that have proven their loyalty, Barking-Sun will publish a book for every good dog to carry around. As it is printed with a red cover, it will soon enough be known as the ''little red book''."
 
 # Luxembark path
 
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate:0 "The Outsider Candidate"
 BRZ_the_outsider_candidate_desc:0 "To the surprise of everyone, Rosey Luxembark has won the race for chancellorship. The more established political parties are still in utter confusion how she got here, but our new government has a clear task: To reform Bronzehill so that the workingdogs can finally take their fair share."
 
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs:0 "A Government For The Workingdogs"
 BRZ_government_for_the_workingdogs_desc:0 "The SPB always was the true defender of working rights in Bronzehill. We have stood up for the common dog when others hid behind promises of reform or populist lies. Now that we have the strings of power in our paws, we can truly bring forth a government for the workingdogs."
 
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles:0 "Curtail The Nobles"
 BRZ_curtail_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have reacted with concern to Luxembark's chancellorship, with some even calling for openly resisting her rule. With cannot stand. While we don't intend to abolish their titles, we need to curtail their political power so that they can no longer threaten our plans to reforge the economy."
 
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws:0 "Reverse The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_reverse_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "For a long time, the operations of the SPB and the socialist movement were hamstringed by a series of laws dubbed the ''socialist laws'', which outlawed our organizations and writings. However, with this, the reactionaries have set a legal precedent, which we can now turn on its head. From now on, reactionary propaganda is banned in Bronzehill."
 
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union:0 "Purge The National Union"
 BRZ_purge_the_national_union_desc:0 "The National Union is a collection of militarists, reactionaries and imperialists, in short, the anti-thesis to our government. And of course, their chairdog Rufus Loudbark has tried to turn the army against our government ever since it came to be. But with the new anti-reactionary laws at paw, we can finally shatter their movement."
 
 BRZ_replace_the_count:0 "Replace The Count"
 BRZ_replace_the_count_desc:0 "Until now, Count Ignatius has accepted our government, if only barely. However, there can be little doubt that he intends to overthrow our government as soon as he gets the opportunity. While Rosey Luxembark does not intend to abolish the monarchy, we could just force Ignatius to abdicate in favour of Barnaby, who is much less of a threat to our government."
 
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils:0 "Introduce Worker Councils"
 BRZ_introduce_worker_councils_desc:0 "One of the key program points is the establishment of worker councils, which would serve as a democratic root for the socialist party. However, let us not put our hind paws in the front. For now, the worker councils will not directly take over the economy, but serve as counsel for the factory workers."
 
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs:0 "Expropriate The Oligarchs"
 BRZ_expropriate_the_oligarchs_desc:0 "The businessgriffs from Herzland, but also various domestic nobles and businessdogs have formed an oligarchical power structure that controls Bronzhill's economy. We cannot stand for this. We will expropriate the worst cases and levy heavy taxes on the rest, so that our government can gain back control over our economy."
 
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog:0 "March Of The Working Dog"
 BRZ_march_of_the_working_dog_desc:0 "The ''March of the Workingdogs'' is a famous political song from Bronzehill, adapted by us as the new anthem. United we stand, for the common good. Singing this song, we will march on Griffenheim and bring forth a new era of socialist cooperation and workers democracy."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry:0 "Sway The Peasantry"
 BRZ_sway_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The agrarian population of Bronzehill is large and consists of many destitute dogs and griffons. Yet, they have not heart our call and stayed apathetic to our government's reforms. We have to go on the offensive and listen to their issues, so that the every dog can stand united."
 
 BRZ_worker_self_organization:0 "Worker Self-Organization"
 BRZ_worker_self_organization_desc:0 "First results from the expropriation of nobles are in, and the results are astounding. It is clear that factories work better if the workers can decide themselves how to organize. They don't need bosses to shove them around, for they have the most experience of how things really work."
 
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university:0 "Expand Bronzekreuz University"
 BRZ_expand_bronzekreuz_university_desc:0 "The University of Bronzekreuz is still young, but it is expanding rapidly. Bronzehill needs new talent; it needs researchers, engineers, teachers and other professionals to be able to stand up to Griffenheim. We will put in another massive expansion round for the university, to hopefully attract new talent from back home and abroad."
 
 # Barnaby path
 
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby:0 "Give Power To Barnaby"
 BRZ_give_power_to_barnaby_desc:0 "With Copperhill's ascendance to chancellorship, our country is now on the track of democratic and harmonic reform. Given Barnaby's close relationship with him in the past, it is best for our nation if Ignatius would step down and pass the crown to the crown prince, something that he has agreed to do."
 
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists:0 "Negotiate With The Socialists"
 BRZ_negotiate_with_the_socialists_desc:0 "The radicals from the SPB have expressed their discontent with our reform agenda and agitate against us with their radical slogans. However, the SPB also has a rather large faction of moderates, which could be won over if we prove ourselves as genuine reformers. We will listen to their demands,  as when they switch sides, the rest of the SPB will sink into irrelevance."
 
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws:0 "Labour Reform Laws"
 BRZ_labour_reform_laws_desc:0 "Our promises to the progressives and moderate socialists should not stay empty, or otherwise we could find ourselves in trouble once more. But our labour reforms are not socialist in nature, but aim to create a more just, equal and harmonious society."
 
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda:0 "Start The Reform Agenda"
 BRZ_start_the_reform_agenda_desc:0 "The list of problems in Bronzehill is long, and so is the list our planned reforms. With Barnaby and Copperhill at the helm, we can finally make our dreams of a better Bronzehill into a reality. Our first step is to formalize our rule by creating a cabinet with clear administrative responsibilities."
 
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles:0 "Sway The Nobles"
 BRZ_sway_the_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have looked with concern on all of our promises, as they fear that we will come after their privileges. And this is true, to some extent. Yet, we have to make it clear to them that this is the best they can hope for anyways. In this modernizing world, a society build purely on nobles is weak, as proven by the revolution of 978."
 
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union:0 "Undermine The National Union"
 BRZ_undermine_the_national_union_desc:0 "The last place we have to bring to our side is the army. Loudbark has a tight grip on the soldiers, but our reform agenda will improve their lives too. We will go to the barracks to tell and listen, so that hopefully they will abandon their radicalism for our harmony."
 
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs:0 "Deal With The Businessgriffs"
 BRZ_deal_with_the_businessgriffs_desc:0 "There is no way of putting it mildly: These businessgriffs, whether from Griffenheim or somewhere else in Herzland, are a stain on Bronzehill's economy and we need to do something about them. Although large-scale nationalizations run against our party principles in general, in this case there is simply no way around it."
 
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections:0 "New City Council Elections"
 BRZ_new_city_council_elections_desc:0 "Until now, the city councils were elected under a census suffrage system, where only middle and upper class residents could vote. However, we have now abandoned this system in favour of a true universal suffrage, and it is time to put this new law into practice. New city council elections will be held, open to everyone."
 
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice:0 "Our Cause For Justice"
 BRZ_our_cause_for_justice_desc:0 "When we march against Griffenheim, it is not out of treason to the empire, no, it is rather in the desire to bring true justice, harmony and equality to the empire as a whole. Grover needs a good regent, who can reform the empire, not selfish nobles or lunatic theocrats."
 
 BRZ_domestic_investments:0 "Domestic Investments"
 BRZ_domestic_investments_desc:0 "Bronzehill's economy is still very weak. We need to reinvest whatever money we have, so that our economy backbone is strong enough to survive the coming troubles."
 
 BRZ_unite_the_reformers:0 "Unite The Reformers"
 BRZ_unite_the_reformers_desc:0 "There are many reform minded dogs and griffons in Bronzehill. With the recent council elections, we have proven to them that we are not here to talk, but to take action. We stand for what we say, and if the support us, it will not be in vain."
 
 # Loudbark path
 
 BRZ_the_iron_chancellor:0 "The Iron Chancellor"
 BRZ_the_iron_chancellor_desc:0 "Rufus Loudbark has claimed the chancellorship. Under his firm paw, Bronzehill will be transformed into the most loyal guard of the emperor, although we first have to rescue the emperor from his bad advisors. With the military at the forefront, our greatness is secured."
 
 BRZ_sharpen_the_socialist_laws:0 "Sharpen The Socialist Laws"
 BRZ_sharpen_the_socialist_laws_desc:0 "The Socialist Laws were an approach by Ignatius and his supporters to curtail the socialist movement without actually banning it. What a nonsense approach! We will solve this issue once and for all, and as a first step we will ban all remaining socialist organizations, including the SPB."
 
 BRZ_expand_rural_subsidies:0 "Expand Rural Subsidies"
 BRZ_expand_rural_subsidies_desc:0 "We cannot forget any of our supporters. Yes, the army is our main strength, but without the peasants who proudly stood against socialist agitation, we would not be where we are now. In return, we will set up new subsidies for the peasantry."
 
 BRZ_our_city_reforms:0 "Our City Reforms"
 BRZ_our_city_reforms_desc:0 "The National Union believes in democracy, we really do. However, this democracy cannot get in the way of an orderly and secure society. We will drop the census suffrage currently used by the city councils, but in turn we will ensure that only trusted candidates can stand in the council elections."
 
 BRZ_using_the_army:0 "Using The Army"
 BRZ_using_the_army_desc:0 "The army is our greatest asset, and exactly the right tool to use against the remaining socialist agitators. We will raid their hiding spots and fight their street gangs. Let's see how their puny ''militias'' will do against our armoured cars."
 
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act:0 "The Nationalization Act"
 BRZ_the_nationalization_act_desc:0 "The assets of the various Herzland companies in Bronzehill are nothing short of foreign meddling in our affairs. These businessgriffs seem to think that just because they invested a few idols they get to decide what ''their'' companies should produce or who they should employ. Well, only one solution then."
 
 BRZ_approach_the_nobles:0 "Approach The Nobles"
 BRZ_approach_the_nobles_desc:0 "Many nobles have opposed Loudbark for a long time, seeing his ideas as hazardous and populist. But the situation has changed. No longer is it about gaining political power, it is now about coming to terms with the new reality. Some nobles have already endorsed Loudbark, and we now have to convince the rest of them."
 
 BRZ_the_military_industrial_complex:0 "The Military-Industrial Complex"
 BRZ_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Our industry and our army need to be in close cooperation. After all, what is all that industry for, if not to produce what our armies need? Sure, we also need various goods for the dogs of our nation, but this is only so that these dogs can serve as soldiers, right?"
 
 BRZ_unleash_the_dogs_of_war:0 "Unleash The Dogs Of War"
 BRZ_unleash_the_dogs_of_war_desc:0 "As escaped slaves, Bronzehill has a pacifist history. For a long time, we saw war as something that would bring only harm and suffering. However, the recent changes we have made start to effectively challenge that mind-set.  If we do it right, we can unleash the dogs of war, that they may rescue the emperor."
 
 BRZ_militarization_of_the_police:0 "Militarization Of The Police"
 BRZ_militarization_of_the_police_desc:0 "What is the police for? They are your friend and helper, sure, but they are also to keep our society in order and devious elements in check. And for that, they need proper equipment and training. We will give them better guns, armoured cars and wide ranging authority to fulfil their duty."
 
 BRZ_build_the_hundsfeld_military_academy:0 "Build The Hundsfeld Military Academy"
 BRZ_build_the_hundsfeld_military_academy_desc:0 "So far, Bronzehill has no military academy of its own. Until now, the few dogs that became officers used the Imperial academies, mostly the one in Helheim. However, our ties with Griffenheim are cut, if only temporarily, and also there can never be enough military academia. Therefore, we will open a new military academy in Hundsfeld."
 
 BRZ_end_griffenheim_control:0 "End Griffenheim Control"
 BRZ_end_griffenheim_control_desc:0 "Even after so many reforms, there are still some ways in which Griffenheim is able to pull the strings in our nation. From various trade relationships to some shares that so far have escaped nationalization, these dependencies need to be cut. Bronzehill will be strong on its own."

 ### IDEAS ###
 # Industry
 BRZ_imperial_industry:0 "Imperial Owned Industry"
 BRZ_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Many griffons in Griffenheim have invested in Bronzehill, leaving very few local-owned mines, farms and factories. While this has helped develop Bronzehill's industrial capabilities, it has caused worry among locals who fear for their County's stability and soveignty. The issue will have to be addressed in some form, lest the whole nation ends up in the ownership of foreigners."

An orphan too young to rule, a regency has been established to govern in his stead, leaving the young griffon as a powerless figurehead. However, unlike with Grover V the regents aren't selfish and corrupt fools. Not only that, but Grover VI is not sickly or weak, but has a sharp and curious mind as well as a natural talent for leadership.

 # General Events
 bronzehill.1.t:0 "A Messenger In The Night"
 bronzehill.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius' paws gripped tightly into his wooden throne. There had to be some mistake. Or perhaps this was just some cruel joke? He stared down at the griffon messenger who remained bowed at the foot of his throne. He wore a simple black cloak, held around him by an Imperial broach. One given out by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe pit that had opened in his stomach only grew wider. It couldn't be true, it just couldn't.\n\n\"Say it again,\" he said. His throat was dry and each word was a painful, breathless gasp.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the messenger said. \"The Emperor. He's...\"\n\nDead. The word hung in Count Ignatius' mind like a ball in flight. The throne creaked under his grip. No, it couldn't be true. How could the Emperor have died? He was always there - just like the sun and the moon. Without him there would be no world. There would be no light, no beauty, no joy. How could there be without him?\n\nCount Ignatius couldn't feel his own heart anymore. It was as if it some unseen being had ripped it out of his chest, leaving only an inky black void in his place. His essence of life and very soul had vanished with the messenger's words. Perhaps for good.\n\nHe launched himself from his seat, startling the messenger. \"No! You... You lie! It's not true. It can't be true. The Emperor. He can't... He can't be...\"\n\nA rasping choke caught in Count Ignatius' throat. He was on the ground now with his tail between his legs. He didn't know how he had fallen there. It hurt to breath and his eyes burned as if someone had rubbed lime and soap into them. And there was a sound. A pained, unnatural sound that echoed all around. Like the wails of a million lost souls all crying out in pain.\n\nHis ears stood on ends, fearful of the source, whatever horror it might be. Then he realised it: The sound was coming from his own throat and joined in with a symphony of anguish from all other dogs in his court.\n\nThe Emperor was Dead. And every dog in Bronzehill wept that day."
 bronzehill.1.a:0 "No, please no. Please..."

 bronzehill.2.t:0 "The Flower Gems"
 bronzehill.2.d:0 "It is a Diamond Dog tradition, that in the event of a death, the family and friends of the deceased are expected to gather a bouquet of precious stones known as flower gems. These stunning rocks are then crafted into a beautiful display which adorns the deceased's grave and acts as a reminder of how much they were loved and cherished.\n\nIn the wake of Grover's death, the dogs of Bronzehill have begun a migration to the capital. Each of them depositing their own collection of gems at the count's palace. Within a day this collection was impressive, within a week it was majestic, now it's overwhelming.\n\nCount Ignatius Bronzetail has commissioned the greatest artisans of the county to work together and manufacture these gems into a grand display of our dogs' devotion to the emperor. Already this display has begun to take shape, composed of a beautiful statue of Grover's likeness with a base that houses a mural which promotes the Emperor's many accomplishments.\n\nAs it nears completion, we must decide if we should send this to Griffenheim, as a solemn gift to Grover VI, or if it should remain in Bronzekreuz as a monument to our devotion and loyalty to the crown."
 bronzehill.2.a:0 "Send it to Griffenheim."
 bronzehill.2.b:0 "Display it in Bronzekreuz."

 bronzehill.3.t:0 "Bronzehill Sends a Gift"
 bronzehill.3.d:0 "In the wake of the emperor's death, our vassals in Bronzehill have presented us with a truly beautiful gift. It is a part of Diamond Dog culture, that in the event of a death, the dogs close to deceased will gather gemstones, known as flower gems, and sculp them into a memorial.\n\nThese dogs have remembered their loyalty to the crown well and have submitted their gift, crafting a truly impressive statue of Grover V constructed out of precious gems gathered by hundreds of thousands of the county's citizens.\n\nMany have called for us to place this statue in the imperial mausoleum as a sign of our gratitude for this cherished gift. While it would no doubt be a glorious addition to the emperor's tomb, it can not be ignored that this statue would fetch a rather high price amongst art collectors with the money helping to stabilise our budget."
 bronzehill.3.a:0 "Send our thanks to Bronzehill!"
 bronzehill.3.b:0 "It's a shame it never arrived..."

 bronzehill.4.t:0 "Griffenheim Accepts our Gift"
 bronzehill.4.d:0 "Our gift to the imperial court has been graciously accepted with our statue being proudly displayed within the hallowed grounds of the imperial mausoleum. For generations to come, many will pass through those chambers and see our contribution to Grover V's memory presented front and centre.\n\nA thank you letter from Grover VI was received by Count Ignatius Bronzetail. In it, the young emperor thanks both the Count and his subjects for their lovely gift and he assures us all that our devotion has made these troubled times easier.\n\nIt's rumoured that the Count had this letter framed and displayed within his personal office."
 bronzehill.4.a:0 "May our bond with Griffenheim never waver."

 bronzehill.5.t:0 "Insult from Griffenheim"
 bronzehill.5.d:0 "For days, the status of our memorial to Grover V has been left in limbo. We knew for a fact that it was received in Griffenheim but information on its whereabouts weas left fuzzy as soon as it was tranfered to imperial officials. Days passed and there was no official word from the imperial court.\n\nHowever, a leading Griffenheim capitalist recently hosted a memorial ball, which our ambassador attended. In his report, our ambassador states that he discovered that our memorial was not only in the possession of this capitalist but that he had purchased it from government officials for a considerable amount of money.\n\nWhen pressured, the imperial court failed to provide a statement."
 bronzehill.5.a:0 "Was it... not good enough?"
 
 # Industrial story events
 bronzehill_industrial.1.t:0 "The Ravensburg Dam"
 bronzehill_industrial.1.d:0 "For years, the dogs of Ravensburg had waited for this moment. The great dam near the city had finally been finished, half a year behind schedule. However, for now the dogs and griffons of Ravensburg celebrated the opening with large fair. Under pompous fanfare, Count Ignatius cut the red band and ceremoniously gave the signal to start operations.\n\nThe next days, the news all over the country reported about the event. Woofrey Pawner was standing in front of a kiosk and read through the headlines: "Industrial Park operational! Huge Progress for Ravensburg!" (Bronzekreuzer Bote) - "Ravensburg's Industrial Park at work! New opportunities available" (Bronzehügeler Wirtschaftswoche) - "Ravensburg dam opened! How will this affect Bronzehill?" (Harmonisches Morgenblatt) - "New Industries in Ravensburg - but all from Griffenheim" (Nationaler Beobachter) - "Count Ignatius' newest scheme in operation. But will it help him?" (Der Arbeiter). He shook his head. How could they all have so different opinions on the matter? He decided that these scribblers weren't worth this money and moved on.\n\nFar away, in an office in Griffenheim, several griffons toasted on the new project. They hadn't found it necessary to personally travel to Bronzehill, but they surely loved the thought about how many idols would flow into their deep pockets."
 bronzehill_industrial.1.a:0 "Is this our future?"
 
 bronzehill_industrial.2.t:0 "An Argument In The Family"
 bronzehill_industrial.2.d:0 "The door burst open and an angry looking Barnaby galloped into Ignatius' office. The Count looked up, calmly, but with a stern look on his face upon the sudden interruption.\n\n"Father, have you really signed EVEN MORE contracts with that maar-damned Krähe-Stahl?" The Crown Prince fixated his father with his eyes, his anger and disappointment clearly visible. "Bronzehill is becoming more and more a colony of these businessgriffs! Do you really think that the people will not notice? All the major parties condemned how the Grover V Industrial Park was organized, and here you are doing more of the same?"\n\nIgnatius let out a sigh. "My dear son and crown prince, even you are not allowed to burst into my office and yell at me. If I do something, I usually have a good reason for it. But I see from your look that perhaps you haven't gotten it." Ignatius pointed to a chair in front of the desk. "So, please, sit down and listen. You will eventually come to rule this country, and so I should indeed explain this to you. Bronzehill's economy isn't doing well. You perhaps do not know the old prosperity, in the times of before the revolution tore everything asunder. Back then, Bronzehill was the blast furnace of the empire, with the forges of the dogs delivering the finest metals to every corner of it. The Bronzehillian economy was in excellent shape, one of the best of in these times. Then came the revolution, and everything fell apart. But these companies are interested in Bronzehill's ores. They want Bronzehill to once more become the forge of the empire, or what is left of it. We desperately need these investments. I will not bow to some dogs from the streets that seem to know everything better."\n\nBarnaby said nothing for a while, but he shook his head. "I can tell you, father, the dogs from the streets have more power than you assume.""
 bronzehill_industrial.2.a:0 "What price are we willing to pay?"
 
 bronzehill_industrial.3.t:0 "Reaching The Villages"
 bronzehill_industrial.3.d:0 "The journey had been quite taxing. Victor Rotschnabel had flown for several hours, and in the mountains this was not easy. Even more, he also had to carry the bag with his personal belongings, as he would probably not return to Hundsfeld for the next couple of months. But his new job as teacher here in the peaks payed quite well, so at least he would be able to afford a nice vacation once it was over.\n\nWhatever he had expected of the village, it was worse than he imagined. How could these dogs live in their caves without sunlight for so long? And these houses... they truly were more shacks than proper homes. The major lead him to the newly build schoolhouse. At least this looked a bit more comfortable.\n\nThe next morning, the major invited him to an official announcement that the school would open. Many dogs looked at him confused or scared. He could imagine that they had never seen a griffon before. The ceremony was in Dogish. Victor could follow along, as he was one of the few people from the south of Bronzehill who had learned it properly, yet the strong accent proved difficult even for him. After the major’s speech, he passed the word to the new teacher.\n\nVictor sweated dearly, as he tried to not make mistakes in his Dogish. "Dear dogs of Barazgund. Many of you probably did not expect your new teacher to be a griffon. But make no mistake! I'm from Bronzehill as much as you are, and my family has lived near Hundsfeld for generations. I've come to teach your cubs to read and write and calculate, skills that I believe are worthy to learn for everycreature. My lectures will be in Dogish, but the reading and writing will be in Herzlander. Don't worry, I will try my best to integrate into your way of life. I'm not here to represent Griffenheim or Bronzekreuz, but to give your cubs the best start into their lives.""
 bronzehill_industrial.3.a:0 "After a little hesitation, the dogs gave him a nice applause."
 
 # Introduction story events
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.t:0 "The Chairdogship"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.d:0 "Count Ignatius and crown prince Barnaby sat together in the drawing room of Bronzekreuz Castle. It was an underground room in the castle, only dimly lit by the chandaliers on the ceiling.\n\n"Barnaby, my son, as you are probably aware, I have decided to call the Bronzehill council. The crisis that has overtaken Griffenheim has severely impacted us as well. Our nation mournes, as do we, therefore it is neccessary to show unity." Barnaby wagged his tail in approval. "But this is not enough. I have also decided that you, my prince, should get the chairdogship in the council. It is only good if the people see you take responsibility, and I think, you are ready for it."\n\n"I see what you mean. At your will, I will lead the council and look for that the council has only the best interest of Bronzehill in mind. Have you decided yet whom to invite?"\n\nA servant brought in a plate of meatballs. Ignatius and Barnaby ate silently for a while, before Ignatius answered:"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.1.a:0 ""No. I will need to arrange some meetings.""
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.t:0 "The Old Reformer"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.d:0 "Ignatius decided that he should meet with Winston Copperhill. Though he did not share his son's enthusiasm for the veteran, or Copperhill's distaste for Griffenheim businessgriffs, his career record and accomplishments were not easily disregarded. Thus they sat together at one of the Bronzekreuz clubs, far from anydog's curious ears, sharing a plate of ham and strong Hindian tea between them. "How glad I am you found time for me, Copperhill. How are the pups doing?"\n\n"You haven't invited me here to discuss our children, nor for old war stories, Ignatius. Clearly there is something of greater importance going on, and since I am a busy dog, we should get to it at once." As usual, Winston had little appreciation for decorum, small talk, and wasting time, which the Count could certainly appreciate.\n\n"Very well then. Obviously you heard of it by now — the Emperor has passed away, just as we believed he was about to recover." It still tugged at the heartstrings. "You know what happened last time, you were there and seen it all for yourself. We owe our freedom to griffons, and we'll do anything to keep it that way. To pre-empt any sort of potential instability, I have decided to convene the Bronzehill Council, and you should be present there, though I might not agree if you decide to bring along some friends." Copperhill was hardly a firebrand, but some in his clique were not to Ignatius' sensibilities.\n\nCopperhill kept his expression deliberately impassive, taking a considerable time with the tea. At last, he spoke: "You'll understand if I do not turn out to be your enthusiastic supporter, but I'll gladly accept your invitation. The Emperor's passage has been a... difficult time for everydog, but we cannot mourn forever. This is a great opportunity to enact some positive changes not just for Bronzehill, but for the Empire at wide." Surprisingly optimistic for the old dog, but he wasn't willing to acquiesce just yet. After some further discussion, Copperhill had given the Count some names to consider. Ignatius did not mention that Barnaby would be the chairdog, and since Copperhill had not mentioned it either, chances were good he already knew."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.2.a:0 "How much reform does Bronzehill need, and how much would break it?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.t:0 "An Unusual Guest"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.d:0 "Bronzekreuz Castle may not have been the biggest castle, but it surely had its fair share of secrets. Barnaby had spent much of his youth exploring the secret rooms you could find in the underground parts of the castle, and now it came in useful for a quite serious purpose. He had invited a usual guest into the castle, and they both had agreed that their conversation should better remain private. And so, in one of the hidden meeting rooms, Barnaby and Rosey Luxembark sat on old chairs around an even older table.\n\nRosey Luxembark decided to open. "I honestly have to say, this invitation was something I did not expect. And I guess your father would also not expect it?" Barnaby gave a slow nod. "He doesn't exactly have the best opinion on the SPB, I would say." She let out a chuckle.\n\n"He has not, indeed. But this is more important than just his opinion. The workers deserve representation."\n\n"For a price, I assume?"\n\n"To respect the Council would already be quite a good price, I think." Barnaby sighed. "But this is indeed not all. As you can probably imagine, Loudbark will be on the council as well. He and his militarists are a clear danger to our Bronzehill."\n\nLuxembark took a while to answer, weighing her option. "I can help with that, indeed." She let out another chuckle. "I guess it will be quite the shock for the Count when you present him this idea. Anyways, let me give you some names of people you can trust." She fumbled in her briefcase. "Woofkin, yes, Liebarknecht, as well. Not Barking-Sun. Maybe Tählpoodles?" Her words got lost while she was scribbling all over a sheet of paper.\n\nTwo hours later, Barnaby had good knowledge of most upper SPB party members. Luxembark had told some jokes of inside the party, almost forgetting whom she was speaking to. But their plan was clear - now it was on the Crown Prince to convince his father."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.3.a:0 "Barnaby and Luxembark parted in good spirit."
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.t:0 "A Word With Loudbark"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.d:0 "It was quite unusual for the Count of Bronzehill to visit the barracks in Barkgenz, but Rufus Loudbark had ensured him that there they would find an opportunity to speak in private, for their meetup might be seen as controversial for the more moderate minded dog. Thus the gruff soldier led Ignatius to a nearby bunker, which was positively austere compared to his usual surroundings, but he wasn't going to complain about it. He would have raised a word about his deputy's presence, but Loudbark reassured the Count that Lassie would keep things confidential.\n\nHuddled together in a small room, Loudbark wasted little time with his usual diatribe. "I was most surprised, quite so, when I learned you wished to meet with me, my Count. Have you finally seen the folly of your ways? Have the Griffenheim vultures filched enough marrow from common dogs' bones? Grover is dead, and you know what will happen next. Unrest and insecurity, and poor Bronzehill stuck in the middle of it, with few options for itself." The deputy nodded enthusiastically to everything he said like an excited pup.\n\nIgnatius, however, had to resist the urge to smack himself in the face with both paws. "That's quite enough, Rufus. While your rhetoric might work on somedog more simpleminded, I've been singlepawedly keeping the terms of our agreement with the griffons as fair as they possibly can be." Not to say that they weren't demanding at times. "But you are right about the other thing. There must not be a repeat of 978, and to that end I think the National Union deserves a fair representation in the Bronzehill Council. We might not agree on everything, but especially now everydog must stand together."\n\nHe could almost see the gears turning in Loudbark's head. Accept and gain some actual influence in decision making, or refuse to play the eternal populist complaining from the sides? It didn't take very long. "You can't blame me for trying. We'll be joining you at the Council.""
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.4.a:0 "Is militarism really an answer?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.t:0 "Up In The Hills"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.5.d:0 "The shack looked exactly how he remembered it, poor, dirty and generally in disrepair. How many years had it been? At least four, maybe five. Kimball Barking-Sun looked at his old home, here in the village he was born in. Kaza-Narag was not a special village, just one of many coal mining villages in the upper mountains of Bronzehill. Once a week large trucks arrived to carry away the coal mined, in exchange for food and other necessities. But they were never generous. How was this not slavery? Had they even escaped the mountain tyrant, the slaver of Diamond Mountain, or had they just exchanged his rule for that of his minions?\n\nBut Barking-Sun was not here for nostalgia. No, pressing issues were on the agenda. An opportunity how it could only ever happen once a century had opened. From his spies, he had learned of the meeting between Luxembark and the crown prince, with some juicy information about her opinions on other party members. If Ignatius would dismiss Barnaby's proposal - which he would do, as minion of the mountain tyrant - he would finally find his opening to oust her as chairdog of the SPB and wrangle control of the party for himself. And then, the real task begun. Finally, the old wrong could be corrected, the misfortune of Grover II overcome. And if everything would go according to his plan, the rule of the mountain tyrant could finally be ended for good, four Grovers later than it should have been.\n\nBut for all these lofty plans, he needed the support of the mining dogs. They knew him, and they trusted him. He had worked for years here, besides them, and he knew what steered them. Things would need to start moving, for if this change was missed, how long would it be before another one would present itself?"

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.t:0 "A Meeting In Ravensburg"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.d:0 ""Grandmaster Lucky! The Temple of Boreas welcomes you."\n\nPrelate Gunhild led the Knight to a sidedoor of the temple, behind which she had her personal rooms. A young griffon brought in a plate of snacks, after which she waved him out of the room.\n\n"Lucky, my pious friend, you should visit me more often. Are your knights doing alright? They are strong in their belief, standing for faith and Empire."\n\nShe surely would have continued like this for a while, but Lucky cut her off. "Prelate Gunhild, I admire how you always find the right words. But we should come to the matter of this meeting." Always straight to the point. "The socialists have proven more and more emboldend. The Count is double-minded here, sometimes trying to put them down but at other times he lets them get away with their godless posturing. And the Crown Prince is even worse."\n\n"Ignatius is a good person, but his faith is weak. He doesn't trust the Archonate as much as he should. Have I not told him long ago that these socialists needed to be dealt with properly?" She clapped her beak in disappointment. "Perhaps we need to make our support more known to him."\n\n"You are correct, as you always are. I will ready my knights to secure our dear Bronzehill from the unbelievers.""
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.6.a:0 "Can we trust the clergy in times of need?"
 
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.t:0 "Finishing The List"
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.d:0 "Like a few weeks prior, Ignatius and Barnaby sat in the drawing room of Bronzehill Castle. Before them was a long list, the collection of potential councillors. While the Count reserved himself the right to make the final call, he wanted to see what priorities his son would set, and so they vividly discussed each of the candidates. Most of the nobles on the list were set; they were too indispensable and pass over them would just be a political faux pass. Yet, with the political figures on the list, the choices weren't so clear. Both Copperhill and Loudbark had provided a number of candidates that they claimed to deserve a seat, but some of these names would need to be cut to not give the politicians to much power in the council.\n\nAs they argued, Barnaby also had a different thought in mind. It seemed almost inevitable that both the HKP and the NU would end up with the same number of councillors, just to save political face. And here he would need to argue to his father, as he knew that Ignatius was also weary of Loudbark.\n\n"I want to bring a different idea on the table. I know that we are both concerned that Loudbark could sway the council into making decisions that... would be unpleasant to work with. But what if we brought in another candidate? Like Luxembark?" The Count's ears pinned back upon hearing that name, but he didn't say anything. "Including her and maybe one or two of her friends would make controlling Loudbark easier. And it would also serve as a much needed guesture to the working dogs of Bronzehill, that we have not forgotten they exist."\n\nBarnaby tried his best to tempt Ignatius to consider the idea, but his father just fixated him with his eyes. After a while, Barnaby ran out of ideas of what to tell, and so they remained silent for a minute. He knew that the answer would be the final one."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.7.a:0 ""I might personally dislike her, but you have a point.""

Rosey Luxembark could already tell that somehow her meeting with the Crown Prince had become public - the question just remained how bad it would be. She had already regretted having spilled the beans to much in front of Barnaby. The constant party discussion had just gone on her nerves recently.\n\n"It has come to my knowledge that our chairdog, Comrade Luxembark, has had a meeting with Crown Prince Barnaby.", Barking-Sun opened. "During this meeting, she apparently felt confident to tell the young prince a variety of things. My informant has given me a list of remarks that she made with regards to our much valued comrades." He led out a smirk. "But this is not all. Furthermore, I was informed that Prince Barnaby had offered her a place in the Bronzehill Council, for the price that she would order us to stop distributing 'inflammatory material'. I would like to ask you all, is that the behaviour of a good chairdog? Is that what loyalty to our movement looks like?"\n\nThe meeting went on for a bit. Luxembark tried to defend her meeting with Barnaby as best as she could, while dismissing the "remarks" that Barking-Sun had found out about as baseless slander. However, in the end, she saw no other chance then to call a leadership vote, otherwise the party would never unite behind her anymore. As could be expected, her rival decided to challenge her in that vote.\n\nAnd with a margin of 7-5 votes, the party leadership board voted in favour of Barking-Sun. Luxembark announced her resignation and, in a very formal voice, offered her congratutations to him."
 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.8.a:0 "Barking-Sun took the stage with a wide smile."

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.9.d:0 "All things were ready. The list of councillors had been finalized, the invitations send out, and now the Bronzehill Council could open with a speech from Count Ignatius. His speach was measured, asking the dogs to show unity in these trying times. Then he introduced his son and Crown Prince as the chairdog of the council, before closing with a minute's silence for Grover V. In his mind, things would fall into place soon. The council would make a statement in support of Griffenheim, discuss maybe minor details and then dissolve again.\n\nHowever, the world is full of surprises. And this surprise came from none other than the Count's own son.\n\n"In the light of recent developments, I would like to discuss with you the extend of Bronzehill's responsibilities to the Griffonstone dynasty in general and Grover VI in particular. As history has proven, regencies are a difficult time for any empire. The developments that led to the catastrophy of 978 were, in part, caused by the disloyalty of Griffenheim's noblegriffs to their - and our - rightful emperor." Barnaby looked around attentively, focussing the councillors with his eyes. "We might therefore need to take a more active approach in guranteeing that history will not repeat itself. And as I can proudly add, Bronzehill's loyalty to the Griffenstone dynasty is beyond any doubt."\n\nWhat followed was a vivid discussion on these contentious claims. Count Ignatius could only watch in horror as Winston Copperhill, Rufus Loudbark and Rosey Luxembark, together with their associates, all argued in favour of what was quickly named a "Bronzehill Regency". And as Barnaby announced a vote on the motion, it passed with the combined support of all three faction. What was he to make of this?"

 bronzehill_politicalintroduction.10.d:0 ""Barnaby, we need to talk." His son already led his tail hang. "I am disappointed in you. It is very clear to me, that you knew that this motion would not find my support, and so have started it without my approval. I don't think that you can imagine what you have unleashed on Bronzehill." Barnaby wanted to give an answer, but a stern look from Ignatius cut him off. "Before you answer anything, I will tell you that I still not approve of the motion. It will be overruled by decree of the Count. The Council will of course complain. But there is no other way now."\n\nWhile the Crown Prince looked miserable, he still tried to give an answer. "My father, I respect your decision. You are the Count. But I want to say at least that the forces I ostensibly unleashed were already there. Many of our institutions are weary of how our relationship with Griffenheim works. And who tells us that it will not end in another catastrophe?"\n\n"I can tell you, it will not. The Griffenheim court is different from how it was 50 years ago. They will figure something out. Our place is to serve the emperor, not trying to overthrow is regent in a useless endeavour."\n\nThe next day, Count Ignatius gave a statement to the Bronzehill Council. It was rather short, informing the council that the last vote would be overturned by the Count's veto. The reactions were, as expected, quite hostile. They would be needed to be dealt with."

As nothing seemed to move forward, Count Ignatius had already tinkered on the idea of disbanding the council and throwing his support behind the regent in Griffenheim. However, now the Council gathered together and finally ended the deadlock. The chair of the council, Crown Prince Barnaby, announced a vote on who should be recommended to Count Ignatius to serve as "Chancellor" of the nation, a new position that would serve as head of government.

Early in the morning, a well-organized attack on Bronzekreuz cut the city from the communication lines. Simultaneously, subversive elements in the army derailed an early response plan, while all across the country the mining dogs formed militias to patrol the streets.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the Bronzetail family was tipped off and had decided to spend the days in the summer residence near Bellen. While their estate was quickly assaulted and taken, the Count and his family had already fled into the woods.\n\nAt ten o'clock, a radio message from Barking-Sun could be heard on all channels. "Dogs of Bronzehill! I am speaking to you from Bronzekreuz to tell you that our comrades from the SPB have taken over the government. While the reaction will try to dislodge this act of revolution, we will stand our ground and fight.

Of course, quite a few councillors were invited from such an influential institution. Some of them had party loyalties to follow, but a surprising number of these councillors were not aligned to a party, or if they were, interpreted their party membership quite liberal.

However, the vote passed, and slowly but surely most nobles have realized that the future of Bronzehill would lie in the paws of the parties, not the Bronzekreuz court.

 bronzehill_loyalist.1.d:0 "Sitting in his chair in Bronzekreuz castle, Ignatius tried to recapitulate the last few days. All in all, his visit of Gabriela had been quite successful. Upon arriving in Readewetter, was honoured by the Strawberry guards and welcomed by the Countess herself. At the first evening, Gabriela had organized a small ball in his honour. Under the dulcet sounds of the Strawberrian court orchestra, he danced with various noble ladies from the duchy.\n\nThinking about the ball brought his mind to Barnaby. Despite his insistence, his son had excused himself from accompanying him on this trip. How much more would have Barnaby needed this ball! He was 23 now and still unmarried. At this age Ignatius had already had two pups... would he even see his grandpups?\n\nCutting off this rather unpleasant train of thought, he focused again on his trip to Strawberry. The next day, Gabriela and he had the conversation that he had wanted to have. Bronzehill would support her in her effort to wrangle the regency from Eros, and in the meantime the two countries would work closely together to make the most of their combined efforts. Over the next days, he had already made some contacts with Strawberrian investors, who had shown quite the interest of taking over shares of Griffenheim companies.\n\nHis thoughts began to wander again. He liked Gabriela, he really did. She had the right ideas. Eros was so... populist and extreme at times, always coated in religious phrasing. Nonsense. All nonsense. Gabriela would do a much better job, surely."

 bronzehill_loyalist.7.d:0 "Ignatius was wandering around in Griffenheim. The city had been devastated by the war, but the fighting had stopped before the soldiers had reached the Imperial Palace or the Temple of Boreas. And the last one was his goal right now.\n\nHe had never been an overly religious dog. The Trinity was watching over griffons and dogs alike, but their supposed servants would rather meddle in politics instead of providing for their parishioners. Archon Eros had laid claim to the regency and tried to turn the whole empire into being subservient to the temples. But he was gone now...\n\nAnd other questions had arisen instead. It had been Bronzehill's army, his loyal dogs, who had taken the centre of the empire. It was now him who could wander through the city, while his soldiers patrolled the streets. This had truly been an unexpected turn of events – who would have thought that small, poor Bronzehill would have been the one to break through the final defence of the Reichsarmee?\n\nThere must have been some reason for that, Ignatius thought. Arcturius had guided the dogs through their battles, and he had favoured them over the griffons. But Boreas, the highest of the trinity, must have told Arcturius to lead the dogs the way. Here, in his temple, now devoid its priest, he would come to an answer.\n\nThis was his question now. Had Boreas told him that the dogs, that he would be the better regent? Or had he just gave the dogs the strength to save the emperor, as the griffons would have failed? He would need to decide, and decide soon."

He was still a good conversationalist, but she could not help but feel uncomfortable in his presence. Who would have known that he could be so assertive?\n\nYesterday, she had taken the train from Readewetter to Griffenheim. She had to admit, Ignatius had welcomed her warmly, but she was unsure if this made things better or worse. But then, then... she could visit Grover. Her sweet, sweet nephew, how dearly she had missed him. He was so smart. And he had grown quite a bit since she had seen him last.\n\n'Hello Auntie', Grover had said, 'how nice that you are also here. Ignatius has said that he will be my regent, but that you will advise him and me. That's good, right? I like him, but he is very formal.'\n\nShe sighed.

My acolyte will serve the dinner soon. Do you wish to join me in prayer to Boreas, who sanctions our rule? I invite you to honour the Trinity, for that the Gods find pleasure in our work."\n\nCould she never let go of her unctuous drivel, Ignatius thought. It was already beginning to annoy him again. But he kept up the play and answered in a measured tone: "Prelate Gunhild, I am also most glad to meet you again. I cannot visit your temple as often as I wish," – what a blatant lie, he thought – "but in times like these I am all the more pleased when I can find the opportunity. For the good of Bronzehill, we need to stand together and overcome what divides us."\n\nA little while later, Gunhild and he were sitting at a lavishly laid table. He had to admit, she was not frugal, maybe she even wished to impress him. During the meal, they only made light conversation, but as they got to the dessert, he decided it was time to come to the topic of this meeting.\n\n"As you know, the socialists are spreading lies and unrest to wherever they go. It should be our common goal to stop their efforts, so that the governance of the country is not disturbed. Therefore, I would like to ask you if you would be willing to join me in a common campaign to counter their agitation."\n\n"My Count, it was a folly to not accept Eros as regent. The temples are the strongest defender against the godless. But this decision has been made, and now we have to do what we must. For that, I will join your efforts, for evil must be fought wherever it arises.""

"I understand that the political situation is difficult, but surely it would be better for everycreature if the economy would not experience the same troubles, right? In the name of the Bronzehügeler Industrieverein, I would like to express my deepest concerns."\n\n"It is understandable that some investors might be concerned about the impact of the proposed measures." Ignatius answered. "Yet, I'm afraid, there is no other way. It is more than likely that Bronzehill will need to stand against Griffenheim, even if hopefully not for long. Under these circumstances the current arrangements are simply no longer viable."\n\n"But why should we be so hasty here? Nogriff wants to interfere in the matter of higher politics." They only did this all the time, Ignatius thought. "We from the Industrieverein simply want everydog and everygriff to prosper. I think that we should look over our agreements again." The pain her face was clearly visible. This would cost them many idols either way. "For sure we can figure something out, together."\n\nAfter three hours of intense haggling, the outlines of a new industrial plan for the country took form. It had not been easy, but Bronzehill's economy would be much more independent in the future."

 bronzehill_loyalist.15.d:0 "Tradition.\n\nHow many dogs would feel the same as him upon hearing that word? Probably not too many, Ignatius had to admit. But wasn't it a wonderful thing? Everything in life had a tradition. From humble things like clothing and food, all the way up to the big questions of governance. It gave security, it gave confidence, it gave stability.\n\nBronzehill had gone through trying times, truly, but now things were starting to come back together. The alliance with Strawberry stood strong, the internal forces that tried to tear Bronzehill apart had been contained and the public mood had swung back to his side. How did he do this? By looking at what truly mattered: Tradition.\n\nIgnatius smiled. It was time to prepare for war, but nothing in life could be as worth fighting for as the tradition of the Empire."

 bronzehill_loyalist.16.d:0 "Today, an envoy arrived from Bronzekreuz. She brought good news, but also a petition for help.\n\nAfter the death of Grover V, Bronzehill went through a political crisis. Many dogs wanted for Bronzehill to become more autonomous – and they even went so far as to suggest that our government should be overthrown in favour of their own regency. However, being the voice of reason, Count Ignatius has overruled these plans, and with this envoy renews his pledge of loyalty towards the Emperor and our regency.\n\nBut this pledge also comes with a request for help. The political forces that have given the Count so much trouble have not given up yet, and he hopes for our support to suppress the troublemakers. We would be foolish not to send him what little he needs, so we have already send the envoy back, so that she can deliver some funds to our loyal dogs."

 bronzehill_loyalist.17.d:0 "The parade came down the street, covered in Imperial flags. The music could be heard from a mile away, as the army orchestra of the Kaisergarde played one triumph march after the other. Griffenheim had sponsored airplanes for the parade, their loud noise being the only thing to overpower the music whenever they dashed over the city, leaving trails in yellow, orange and black.\n\nWoofrey Pawner stood behind the guard rails. The dogs around him where ecstatically waving the troops as they marched. He had to admit, it was hard to not get drawn into the enthusiasm, and so he also waved with the little Imperial flag that police had distributed before the event. Masses were a strange thing, really.\n\nA few hours later, he sat at the table in his house, together with his wife Barkah. She had decided that she didn't want to see the parade, but that didn't mean she wouldn't be curious. "Tell me, how was it? Had they really these flying metal boxes? They didn't crash down, or? I don't trust these things. Griffons can do a lot with their enchantments, but why don't they use their wings, as Eyr intended?" She shook her head.\n\nWoofrey scratched his ear with his hind paw. "Well, yes, they had airplanes. And they seemed to fly very stable. I don't think they rely on magic, though. But they left trails of colour, it was pretty amazing, I have to admit. But they were also loud, very loud. Eh... otherwise, they had music. The orchestra from the Kaisergarde. It was pretty good. Too many marching songs for my taste. But... eh... perhaps fitting for the parade?"\n\n"I still don't know what to make of this. I mean, yes, we should all support the emperor. But don't you think that our Count has become a bit strict lately? I hope that this all cools down again. We dogs serve the emperor, but these businessgriffs, I tell you... I don't like them.""

The opening ceremony for the Grover V Memorial Park was not bombastic, like other celebrations these days, but it was made to honour a late Emperor, and this meant respect and thoughtfulness. Even after this long time, the dogs still mourned.\n\nCount Ignatius opened the ceremony. "Dogs of Bronzehill! This park here is to remind us of a great Emperor, Grover V. His son Grover VI, long may he life, now sits on the golden throne in Griffenheim, where [GRI.GetLeader] acts as his faithful regent. But on this day, we remember the Emperor that has passed on, embraced by Boreas' benign wings. Let us now pray, as Prelate Gunhild prepares the offerings to the Gods, that they may look favourably upon our deeds."\n\nAt his command, the griffoness prepared the offerings. As a number of juicy steaks burned to give to the gods, she spoke the sermon: "Boreas, highest of the gods, hallowed be your name! You gave us intellect, for that we may make wonders for your honour. Eyr, god of the family, hallowed be your name! You gave us bodies, for that we may work in your praise. Arcturius, god of war, hallowed be your name! You gave us strength, for that we may fight for your glory! Gods of the Trinity, look on our work, and give your divine blessing to our monument. This park will hereby be devoted to Grover V, blessed be his name, so we may remember him forever in our heart. Pray, dogs and griffons, who wander through here, for that your hearts may remain pure and loyal, ready to serve the Griffonstone dynasty, now and forever. For that is the will of the gods."\n\nAfter the offerings, the Count gave another speech before the park was finally opened officially. The dogs and griffons spread through the green to look at the various statues of Grover V that adorned the park."

 bronzehill_autonomist.1.d:0 "The news from Bronzehill were troublesome in recent times. After the coup by Kimball Barking-Sun, the former county had taken a radical turn, and the new ruler seemed to purge any institution of the old state.\n\nThe former Count had been forced to flee his residence during the revolution, but so far he had stayed in Bronzehill, in the hopes that loyal elements of the army or bureaucracy would allow for his restauration, or that the Empire would intervene on his behalf. However, now it seems that the Barking-Sun had started a targeted search to dispel the last remnants of monarchist resistance, and if Ignatius didn't want to be captured, he finally had to abandon his old home. His son, Prince Barnaby, had retreated deeper into the mountains together with some loyal followers, but it seemed unlikely that they could risk an open rebellion any time soon.\n\n[THIS.GetLeader] welcomed Ignatius warmly. "My friend, I am sorry for you. While Bronzehill might be ruled by godless revolutionaries for now, there can be little doubt that the Empire shall return one day. I promise you that once this day comes, you will be reinstated in your old titles."\n\n"I am most thankful for your kind words. However, the dogs that I sought to guide and protect have failed me, and I have no aspirations to return to Bronzekreuz. I believe that the lands are better to be ruled by the Emperor directly. For my part, I have no higher wish than to serve the him. Might the other dogs have gone crazy, I know my duty, and I will fulfil it to the best of my ability.""

"Either we strike now or never."\n\nAnother knight took his sword and rammed it into the ground. "This is all so stupid. We are probably sitting in the same cave that they sat before us, and now we prove to be even more coward then they have been. If we do it now, they army might still join us. We have waited too long already."\n\nSurrounded by the knights sat a single, old griffoness. Most would have not associated her with the noble priest that preached the sermon in Ravensburg. Prelate Gunhild had lost some of her feathers, together with most of her eloquent style. "The socialists are the spawn of Maar. We need to squash their heads in for their crimes against the Gods! Trying to arrest me – me, that I'm the representative of Boreas himself. These godless sinners need to go – all of them. If my old friend here" – she looked over to the Grandmaster – "had not warned me in time, only the Gods know what these creatures would have done to me."\n\nFinally, Grandmaster Lucky moved. "You are all maddogs. An attack right now would be suicide. Their government will fail as soon as Griffenheim moves; then we can come out of our caves to serve..." His response was cut off by the alarm bell ringing. "... Oh well, we might as well do our last stand then.""

Seeing the many loyal dogs, ready to serve the Emperor just like he was, filled him with proud. The dogs still had their spirit – together, they would free Grover, who would lead them to true liberty. Inspired by the moment, Barking-Sun stopped. His entourage looked to him in confusion, but he just barked that they should get him a microphone.\n\n"My loyal dogs! The hour approaches. Not for long, and our loyalty will be tested on the battlefield. The reactionaries will throw their griffons against our lines, hoping to stop our advance so that they may keep the Emperor chained forever. But I believe in you. I have heard great things about your training, and I can see on your faces that you are ready to march against the enemy. But don't become complacent! The fight will be hard, long and bloody."\n\nBarking-Sun stopped for a moment, collecting himself. "And now I ask you: Are you ready to fight?" A loud 'Yes' echoed form the soldiers. "Are you ready to sweat and bleed in battle?" Another 'Yes'. "And, if it comes to that, are you ready to give your life for the Emperor?" A third 'Yes' reverberated from the troops.

We only sit here because he fears revolution. Loudbark would probably use the army, but Ignatius hesitates. He can still change his mind."\n\n"The reactionaries always fall because of their internal divisions. The strength of the international workers movement is to use their squabbles to overthrow them."\n\n"Wilhelm, we have all read the theory, thank you." Rosey Luxembark gave him an annoyed look. "And what Clara said is of course true. We might have won for the moment, but we need to tread carefully. Nonetheless, I would agree with Wilhelm that it is sort of poetic to use their own laws against them. To that end, Ernst, have you prepared the lists?" Her minister of justice dropped a stack of papers on the table. "Good. Wilhelm, you are rewriting the curriculum. Clara, you are preparing the new tax codes. There will be backlash.

And of course I am not member of any party, as I think the Count should be not entangled in party politics. I can understand why you would find the new government to be unusual for Bronzehill, but these changes where necessary. We are not here to pursue a radical change of course." Well, except in some parts. Barnaby kept this to himself. "What we do is only to prevent unrest – as you have probably noticed, the socialist agitators almost foiled our plans for this government. It is now our task to convince the masses."\n\n"Pah! In the past, we would have used the army and knocked some sense in these wannabe rebels. And if they wouldn't listen, they would get the rope.

She came to hate the tyrants, and in her young adulthood she wrote polemic after polemic against them, calling for their violent overthrow and for them to face the workers' justice--but never the Emperor. To her, the Emperor was a good griff misled by wicked advisors about the true state of his Empire, and if he found out he'd execute them all on the spot.\n\nHer father used his modest prosperity to enable Rosey and her five brothers to study in the prestigious universities of southern Herzland, where she enrolled to study economics, engineering, sociology and biology. During her studies, she learned more of the deep relationship between the Emperor and his nobility, and suffered a brief crisis of faith. As she grappled with the fact that the Emperor was simply the noble-in-chief, she came to moderate her positions. Still a socialist, she now promoted the thought that old institutions could be kept as figureheads, something that she called \"institutional continuity\". To help her fellow comrades, she decided to switch to study law.\n\nBack in Bronzehill, she was a founding member of the Socialist Party, becoming its second chairdog after August Barken. Among fellow socialists, her pro-monarchy views are a continuous topic of controversy. However, few griffons and dogs of Herzland can deny her commitment to the workers' movement, democratic reform and socialist theory.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

Gräflich-Bronzehügelsche Garde Division.\n\n§YBiography§!: Rufus Loudbark was born as son of peasant farmers in a small village. Being the third son out of four, he pursued a career in the military. He was accepted into the Guards, the elite unite of Bronzehill, initially as an infanterist. After five years, he was transferred to the artillerists and got a promotion, but only to Unterwachtmeister.\n\nDuring his time in the military, Loudbark joined the National Union, which was initially mostly aimed at soldiers. He quickly rose through the party ranks due to his oratory skill. After becoming its chairdog in 1004, he has extended the party's platform and promoted the populist Lassie Goldcoat to be his deputy, appealing also to rural and nationalist dogs. Now that Loudbark has taken power, an strong emphasis of the military can be expected, but Loudbark has also not forgotten his early years.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Duke Von Kessel"

Winston Copperhill is first child of Lord Rover Copperhill and a member of the prestigious Copperhill family. He grew up as a member of Bronzehill's elite during the peaceful reign of Emperor Grover IV. He was one of a few Diamond Dogs who went to the military academy in Helheim and was commissioned as a Leutnant in 966.\n\nAfter a time as a member of the Imperial Guard, he was granted a seat on the Bronze Council in 971 and was a close advisor to the Count. He was often controversial with his desire for social reform and his support of local Bronzehill businesses over Imperial ones. He was a founding member of the Harmonic Conservative Party and sort to bring greater representation of the common hound into the Bronze Council.\n\nDuring the Republican Uprising he was temporary promoted to Oberstleutnant, although did not participate in the fight to restore the Emperor to the throne. The event however convinced him that the only way to ensure the safety of the Emperor is to make Bronzehill strong and ready to fight. A rallying call that has put him at odds with many even in his own party. But his stubbornness and oratory talent have kept him at the forefront of politics.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Flake"

Max Goudtand was born to a diamond dog family in Rottendedam, where his father worked as overseer in a shipyard. Due to the families good income, Goudtand could study economics. At age 25, he decided to go to Bronzehill and opened an iron mine. His business was quite successful, he started to invest also in the refining industry. The "Hüttenwerke Goudtand" grew from there, eventually becoming the largest ore mining business in the whole country.\n\nHis success has earned him both friends and enemies, as many dogs still see him as an "outsider", and despite being a dog some see him barely better than the usual businessgriff. However, by now he has lived in Bronzehill for more than 20 years, trying his best to integrate into the local culture. And his business is one of the main investors in the Grover V Industrial Park - as he claims, to reserve it for a Bronzehillian business."

Her early life was dominated by poverty, and so she joined the communist agitation groups active in the area at the early age of 14 years. She immediately turned out to be a capable agent and excellent at both disguising herself and uncovering infiltrators. However, after three years she left the agitation group to find her luck in the bigger cities of Kaza-Gull, where she joined the police. Here, her talent was quickly discovered and she was trained as a secret investigator for the police.\n\nDespite her young years, her talent is unquestionable to everybody she worked with, and now she has shown interest in building up a spy agency for the armed forces. However, as she says, she doesn't work for any ideological considerations, but purely for the thrill of planning and executing a mission – to play a game of high risk and high reward."
 # Character Note: Sweep Stake is a little bit of a dog supremacist, and not so loyal to the Griffonstone dynasty. However, as no other dog shares this
 # opinion, she keeps her mouth shut. Also she is very young, only 25 at game start, barely older than Barnaby

Butch Bloodhound was born in Hundsfeld, into a family with a long tradition of service in the Bronzehill Police. He, as well as his two siblings, all joined the police, where he quickly got a reputation of "getting stuff done". However, his approaches have not always been conventional. While he is a skilled investigator, giving honour to his family name, the operations that he commanded where often done with an unusual amount of force. But in these operations he also showed a great deal of personal courage that has earned him the respect of his fellow policedogs. Rising through the carrier ladder, he has now found himself to be the chief of the entire police, a job which he fulfils proudly.\n\nDespite that, he is not overly attached to the court in Bronzekreuz – while he receives little love from the socialists he helped oppress for such a long time, he has never personally spoken out against them, and only fulfilled the orders he was given, or so he tells."

Baron Gotthilf von Hohenau, Erbköhler zu Crona, was born on the Estate Honenau in the village of the same name, to a family with long tradition of service to the Griffonstone dynasty. They were once granted the exclusive right to burn charcoal in the area around Crona, which made them incredibly rich. While their monopoly has long been abolished, their family wealth persists as they have invested in various businesses across Herzland. Gotthilf himself studied engineering, and since then has jumped between various positions in the Imperial bureaucracy and his families industries.\n\nIn 1005, he took the job as manager of the Grover V Industrial Park, overseeing its construction, along with managing the investments into the park. To no surprise, he also personally owns some shares in the park. With this, he has grown to become the embodiment of the foreign businessgriff trying to take advantage of Bronzehill – an accusation that he very much denies, claiming to only work for the good of everydog."
