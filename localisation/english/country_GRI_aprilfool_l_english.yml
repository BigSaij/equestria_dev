 ### Empire Events ###
 imperium.1.title:0 "A Shining Beacon"
 imperium.1.desc:0 "There have been multiple reports of power outage at a city in Yale. As yet, the cause of the outage has been claimed to be Yale University but the University itself refuses to publicly comment on the cause of the situation, and will field no questions levied at them. Moderate concern has been growing amongst citizenry in the local area, as ordinary griffs wonder what further disruption may arise from this odd instance. For the time being, however, the majority are continuing on with their daily lives and merely keeping a keen eye out for any weird happenings." #Mara
 imperium.1.a:0 "Peculiar, but science can be strange."

 imperium.2.title:0 "Goldener Thron"
 imperium.2.desc:0 "A call from Yale just reached the imperial palace, and it has sent the court into a frantic scramble. The University of Gamia has just informed us that they have been working on a secretive project that is nearing completion. The project is concerned with offering life support and indeed revitalization for the severely ill. Due to the massive power requirements needed, the project has not managed to finish the clinical stage, and it is only the Emperor's critical condition that has made the researchers offer their aid.\n\nThe suggestion is extraordinary, absurd almost, but they are offering to attempt putting his majesty into the device they have developed and empower it with all the magic that the empire can spare. If their calculations are correct, then his majesty may well recover from his long-standing illness. There is no way of knowing what the the side effects will be - their experiments thus far have been limited to rodents and the like - but as his majesty is fading fast, maybe it should be considered?"
 imperium.2.a:0 "If there is even a sliver of a chance, we must do it!"

 imperium.3.title:0 "Hope is the First Step on the Road to Disappointment."
 imperium.3.desc:0 "When the explosion had rocked the palace and the scream had echoed across the entire city, every eye in Griffenheim had turned to stare towards the center of imperial might. Confusion and shock had been the first response as the thick, billowing fog spewed forth from it to slowly begin to engulf the entire city. Air raid sirens had begun to wail accompanied by the clanging of metal on metal as the sight of the wheezing, blood-choking griffs that stumbled out of it delivered the next response: panic.\n\nChaos followed, and griffs fled in panic away from the deathly mist that had swallowed the palace and threatened to engulf the entire city. Hundreds of thousands ran, tens of thousands died, and as the evening began to fall the entire city was blanketed in gas and death. To make it even worse, attempts to fly over the city has ended in failure as the imperial palace radiates with ominous light - like a great terrible eye in the darkness covering the imperial city.\n\nNocreature knows what is going on, but the imperial hussars are donning protective gear and are desperately trying to re-enter the city. Their gas masks offer only meager protection, but though they choke and die one after one, any attempts to call them off has been ignored or indeed greeted with active hostility from the Diamond Dogs of the guard. Yet for the rest of the empire, there is only chaos as the heart of Griffonia has been torn out, leaving the body to slowly die."
 imperium.3.a:0 "This wasn't supposed to happen!"

 imperium.4.title:0 "The Damnation of Griffenheim."
 imperium.4.desc:0 "The Emperor is dead, choked to death in the deadly fog that now blankets Griffenheim. With him, most of the apparatus of state has scattered or died, and there is chaos across the Herzland. Neither the Emperor nor the Crown Prince appear to have escaped, and there is complete silence from the Imperial government. While it is taking some time for the fact to sink in, the truth is already clear. The Empire is effectively dead..."
 imperium.4.a:0 "And we are left to take charge of our own fate."

 imperium.5.title:0 "The Fracturing"
 imperium.5.desc:0 "With the near complete loss of the imperial government, the empire's constituent parts are breaking away one after another. There is barely even enough of a state left to put up the pretenses of a government, and when the imperial claw no longer provides guidance, the nations of the Herzland has to find it themselves. All that is left is region of Griffenheim itself; a city covered in gas and a countryside flooded with refugees."
 imperium.5.a:0 "Is this the end of the empire?"

 imperium.6.title:0 "Only in Death Does Duty End" #Sweet Chrysalis
 imperium.6.desc:0 "Griffons and Diamond dogs wearing gasmasks enter the city and move towards the palace. Once arrived in the throne room they find that the poison suddenly stops and and see the Emperor awake"

 imperium_news.1.desc:0 "(needs Change)[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After a long 40 year reign the Griffonian Emperor Grover V passed away in the Imperial Palace. Once a brief period of utter chaos in the capital ended, a proper Regency Council was established to guide and care for Prince Grover VI and protect the Empire. A grand funeral procession was organised for the late Emperor in the capital and a ceremony was held confirming Prince Grover VI's succession to the throne.
