 ### Empire Events ###
 imperium.1.title:0 "A Shining Beacon"
 imperium.1.desc:0 "There have been multiple reports of power outage at a city in Yale. As yet, the cause of the outage has been claimed to be Yale University but the University itself refuses to publicly comment on the cause of the situation, and will field no questions levied at them. Moderate concern has been growing amongst citizenry in the local area, as ordinary griffs wonder what further disruption may arise from this odd instance. For the time being, however, the majority are continuing on with their daily lives and merely keeping a keen eye out for any weird happenings." #Mara
 imperium.1.a:0 "Peculiar, but science can be strange."

 imperium.2.title:0 "Goldener Thron"
 imperium.2.desc:0 "A call from Yale just reached the imperial palace, and it has sent the court into a frantic scramble. The University of Gamia has just informed us that they have been working on a secretive project that is nearing completion. The project is concerned with offering life support and indeed revitalization for the severely ill. Due to the massive power requirements needed, the project has not managed to finish the clinical stage, and it is only the Emperor's critical condition that has made the researchers offer their aid.\n\nThe suggestion is extraordinary, absurd almost, but they are offering to attempt putting his majesty into the device they have developed and empower it with all the magic that the empire can spare. If their calculations are correct, then his majesty may well recover from his long-standing illness. There is no way of knowing what the the side effects will be - their experiments thus far have been limited to rodents and the like - but as his majesty is fading fast, maybe it should be considered?"
 imperium.2.a:0 "If there is even a sliver of a chance, we must do it!"

 imperium.3.title:0 "Hope is the First Step on the Road to Disappointment."
 imperium.3.desc:0 "When the explosion had rocked the palace and the scream had echoed across the entire city, every eye in Griffenheim had turned to stare towards the center of imperial might. Confusion and shock had been the first response as the thick, billowing fog spewed forth from it to slowly begin to engulf the entire city. Air raid sirens had begun to wail accompanied by the clanging of metal on metal as the sight of the wheezing, blood-choking griffs that stumbled out of it delivered the next response: panic.\n\nChaos followed, and griffs fled in panic away from the deathly mist that had swallowed the palace and threatened to engulf the entire city. Hundreds of thousands ran, tens of thousands died, and as the evening began to fall the entire city was blanketed in gas and death. To make it even worse, attempts to fly over the city has ended in failure as the imperial palace radiates with ominous light - like a great terrible eye in the darkness covering the imperial city.\n\nNocreature knows what is going on, but the imperial hussars are donning protective gear and are desperately trying to re-enter the city. Their gas masks offer only meager protection, but though they choke and die one after one, any attempts to call them off has been ignored or indeed greeted with active hostility from the Diamond Dogs of the guard. Yet for the rest of the empire, there is only chaos as the heart of Griffonia has been torn out, leaving the body to slowly die."
 imperium.3.a:0 "This wasn't supposed to happen!"

 imperium.4.title:0 "The Damnation of Griffenheim."
 imperium.4.desc:0 "The Emperor is dead, choked to death in the deadly fog that now blankets Griffenheim. With him, most of the apparatus of state has scattered or died, and there is chaos across the Herzland. Neither the Emperor nor the Crown Prince appear to have escaped, and there is complete silence from the Imperial government. While it is taking some time for the fact to sink in, the truth is already clear. The Empire is effectively dead..."
 imperium.4.a:0 "And we are left to take charge of our own fate."

 imperium.5.title:0 "The Fracturing"
 imperium.5.desc:0 "With the near complete loss of the imperial government, the empire's constituent parts are breaking away one after another. There is barely even enough of a state left to put up the pretenses of a government, and when the imperial claw no longer provides guidance, the nations of the Herzland has to find it themselves. All that is left is region of Griffenheim itself; a city covered in gas and a countryside flooded with refugees."
 imperium.5.a:0 "Is this the end of the empire?"

 imperium.6.title:0 "Only in Death Does Duty End" #Sweet Chrysalis
 imperium.6.desc:0 ""Keep moving dogs, we're almost there!" The sergeant yelled, even as he was left coughing hard enough that a metallic taste filled his mouth. The griffons had long since fallen behind, choking to death on the poison, and yet the surviving diamond dogs had kept moving. A trail of death had been left in their wake, soldier after soldier dropping dead, but they didn't care. Every bone in their body, every breath in their burning lungs and every trembling step they took all drove them towards a singular purpose: to find the emperor!\n\nThe great doors of the throne room towered in front of them, the twenty still living dogs pushing against them in desperation. Their muscles heaved, adrenaline surged through their bodies and blood seeped from their lips as the doors slowly were forced open with a groan like the very doors of Tartarus.\n\nAnd suddenly, all was quiet. The poisonous fog receded, and the dogs stepped slowly into the chamber and towards the light. Before them sat the emperor, wreathed in a gloria of golden light. All was quiet, and the dogs stumbled towards him in dazed reverence. Removing his gas mask, the sergeant fell to his knees as tears began to stream down his face. They had done it, they had reached him. Then, the emperor's eyes opened, the light turning blinding as he looked straight at the sergeant.\n\n"LOYALTY IS INDEED THE PURVIEW OF YOUR KIND, DOGS OF BRONZEHILL." The booming voice reverberated through the chamber, loudly enough that the sergeant would have recoiled had he not been frozen in the spot along with his soldiers. A wave of strength filled him, and the golden light reached out to touch him.\n\n"YOU WILL BE VIGILANCE UNENDING. YOU WILL BE DUTY UNSTINTING. YOU WILL BE PUNISHMENT INESCAPABLE. TODAY, YOU BECOME THE BRONZE CUSTODIANS, AND ALL SHALL FEAR YOUR WRATH." The emperor's voice rang in their ears as the glow encased them, stripping away their tattered uniforms and worn gas masks, leaving behind bronzed armor, thicker than any Ironpaw's. When the force holding him in place vanished, the sergeant gasped, looking down at his paws before he looked up at the emperor again."
 imperium.6.a:0 "BRING MY MINISTERS BEFORE ME, CUSTODIANS, FOR THERE IS MUCH TO DO."

 imperium.61.title:0 "By the Emperor's Will"
 imperium.61.desc:0 "The teeming mass of ministers, generals and nobles stood in silence, watching their emperor where he sat upon the throne. They were in the hundreds, but the twenty massively armored dogs that surrounded them kept them all silent. Where they had gained these armors or the heavy glaives they held nogriff knew, but the looks in their eyes had prevented any expressions of curiosity. Doubly so for the emperor, who though he seemed like a corpse on the throne, was all too clearly alive and present by the bright glow in his eyes and the harsh words coming from him.\n\n"IT TOOK WEEKS, AND IN THE END IT WAS THESE, MY MOST LOYAL SUBJECTS, WHO REACHED ME." The bronze-clad diamond dogs did not react to the praise given, only continuing their silent vigil. "OUT OF AN ENTIRE EMPIRE, THESE WERE THE ONES WHO CAME TO MY SIDE. THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND WORTHY WHEREAS YOU ARE YET TO BE JUDGED. NOW SPEAK TO ME ON THE STATUS OF MY EMPIRE."\n\n"Y-your imperial majesty," it was general Ferdinand Dawnclaw who stepped forth. As confused as everygriff else, he could tell that the political chessboard had been flipped over, and those who wished to place their pieces upon it again would need to move swiftly. "The empire is in disarray. We thought you lost to this fog, and your vassals have started to break away. We have attempted to keep order, but all too many have seized their chance to abandon their oaths."\n\n"HAVE MESSAGES DELIVERED TO EACH OF MY ERRANT VASSALS, REMIND THEM OF THEIR OATHS, AND OF THE PUNISHMENT FOR TREASON." The words came so easily, the implication obvious. Through all his reign, Grover V had never spoken this harshly, and yet nogriff found it in themselvse to doubt him. "BRING THE SCIENTIST WHO CREATED THIS DEVICE BEFORE ME, AND MARSHAL ALL LOYAL FORCES. NEITHER I NOR THIS EMPIRE IS DEAD YET, AND THOSE WHO WOULD HASTEN ITS DEMISE SHALL PAY FOR THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS."" 
 imperium.61.a:0 "The Emperor speaks and we obey."

 imperium.7.title:0 "The Mad Savant of Gamia"
 imperium.7.desc:0 ""BELISAR BOLZEN... YOU WERE AWARE OF WHAT WOULD COME TO PASS WHEN I WAS PUT INTO THIS DEVICE, WERE YOU NOT?" The emperor asked the old scientist that kneeled before him. The wild-eyed old griff had been tracked down to the basement in Gamia where he had been hiding and dragged before the emperor, and yet unlike all others who had come before him he was not struck mute, instead only cackling like a madgriff.\n\n"It came to me in a dream! I spent years upon years, stumbling in the dark, and yet insight came to me! The gods granted me insight into the machine, and I saw how to make you what you are today." He stared up at the emperor in manic glee, raising his claws in pleading towards him. "But my emperor, I offer you more than this! Give me only a chance to serve, and I shall make your forces the greatest in Griffonia, nay the world! I will sheathe your warriors in armor unlike any other, and I will arm them with weapons to break all that stand before them! You, the sun of the empire, will have a thousand brightly shining stars surrounding you! Just give me the tools, and I shall conjure everything you can imagine, and make every machine in the Herzland sing your praises!"\n\n"SO BE IT. I NAME YOU ARCHRECTOR DOMINUS, AND IN YOUR CLAWS THE EMPIRE'S TECHNOLOGY OF WAR SHALL BE REBORN. RISE, ARCHRECTOR DOMINUS BELISAR BOLZEN, AND TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.""  
 imperium.7.a:0 "The machines sing the emperor's praise."

 imperium.8.title:0 "The Star Knights"
 imperium.8.desc:0 "A thousand chosen knights, nobles and heroes who had proved themselves loyal even in this time of crisis, had been summoned. They had undergone every experiment that the Archrector Dominus could subject them to. The Archrector had defied every convention, violated every firmly held belief in both metallurgy and enchantment, and his acts upon the bodies of these chosen warriors had left them unrecognizeable. In the wake of the experiments, the new weapons and the emperor's blessing stood something more than what had been before.\n\nThey would be the emperor's finest warriors, these griffs who gave of themselves to him. Like clay they had been moulded and in the furnace of war they would be forged. They were iron will and steely sinew. In great armour they were clad and with the mightiest weapons they were armed. They would be untouched by plague or disease; no sickness would blight them. They had such tactics, strategies and machines that no foe would best them in battle. They would be the empire's bulwark against the Terror. They were the Defenders of Griffonkind. They were the emperor's Star Knights..." 
 imperium.8.a:0 "...and they would know no fear."

 imperium.9.title:0 "Nothing as Wretched or as Hated as a Traitor"
 imperium.9.desc:0 ""What is your purpose here, general?" The Archrector asked as Ferdinand Dawnclaw came striding into the great laboratory. Preoccupied with his experiments, he nevertheless noticed the general in the corner of his eye.\n\n"You're proving yourself day by day, Archrector," Ferdinand told him. "From a dinghy basement in Gamia where they were hiding you away because you had tenure, but had managed to alienate everyone else, to this. The Gods really favours the bold, do they not?"\n\n"There is only one god, and he sits atop the gilded throne. I did my part. You should be out there doing yours. Why are you here?"\n\n"Only one god, is there?" Dawnclaw asked as he approached slowly, dragging his claws along the table. "A brave statement. His power is not that absolute yet, is it? And he only is it because of your technology. Did you make a god did you?"\n\n"What are you-ack!" Belisar was stopped from replying when Dawnclaw's talons wrapped around his neck. The frail old griff grabbed his assailant's claws, trying to pry them away to no avail.\n\n"I spent decades of my life serving that wretch, only to have him reanimated by your sorcery!" Dawnclaw hissed. "And now he has the gall to deny me your enhancements!" Belisar croaked, desperately pulling at Dawnclaw's wrists. "I'm done dancing to that corpse's tune. If there is to be only one god, it'll be one of my choosing!"\n\nIn the end, Belisar's limp body hit the ground, and Dawnclaw turned to the table to begin rummaging around it. It all lay scattered in piles around the lab, and yet the Archrector had been fastidious about his notes. Lifting the documents from the table, Dawnclaw chuckled darkly to himself. Turning around, he passed by the Star Knights that had been waiting outside." 
 imperium.9.a:0 "We're heading to Cloudbury."

 imperium.10.title:0 "Let Griffonia Burn"
 imperium.10.desc:0 "The halls of power ran red with blood. In one fell strike, the revolution was undone and its leaders massacred. A single figure stood in the middle of the carnage, looking down at his blood-drenched gauntlets as he slowly laughed.\n\n"So this is what you were hiding from me, you old corpse?" Ferdinand Dawnclaw cackled as he slowly flexed his talons. The slow, gurgling sound caught his attention and he, without even looking, stomped hard down on the griff next to him, crushing his skull like nothing before walking out of the room. Outside, the hallway as well ran red with blood, and those who had not already been killed by his renegade Star Knights were being rounded up and brought out into the courtyard before him.\n\n"Do not fear, my fellow revolutionaries," Dawnclaw towered high above then as he addressed the crowd, feeling the violent changes he had gone through still aching in his body... it was a good pain! "Those fools you called leaders would only have led you to the grave. You have heard what has awakened in the Herzland, how that corpse of the dead emperor has refused to stay dead! What could your leaders possibly have offered against that?\n\nBy right of force, the force you wielded to try to unseat the emperor, I claim the revolution! Not against merely an empire or an emperor, but against he who claims to be a god! If he seeks to supplant the Three, and his lackeys champion this new 'god' then we shall become the Champions of Maar! We shall greet his claims to lordship with hatred, we shall defile his vaunted purity and turn the order he tries to bring to chaos! You have seen what this technology can do, and unlike him, I will share it willingly with whomsoever swears fealthy. A false god nests in Griffenheim, and his eyes will soon turn on you. When it does, blood is your destiny, but my gifts can make it his instead of yours. Do now cower, my fellow revolutionaries, for the continent will burn before us."" 
 imperium.10.a:0 "Death to the Corpse Emperor!"

 imperium.11.title:0 "The Dawnclaw Heresy"
 imperium.11.desc:0 "The empire has proven itself rotten to the core. Not enough that the supposedly loyal nobles of the Herzland took the first chance to declare independence, not enough that the temples proved themselves committed to only their own power and that all their oaths count for nothing!\n\nTreason has crept into the very heart of the resurgent empire and the great Archrector Dominus Belisar Bolzen lies dead. He was assaulted in his laboratory and strangled to death by General Ferdinand Dawnclaw, who absconded with not only the formulas for the Star Knight enhancements and the blueprints for their weapons, but several hundred Star Knights as well!\n\nThese vile traitors have fled north to the republicans, and have seized control of the region. As if to spit in the emperor's face, they are proudly referring to themselves as the Dawnclaw Heresy, and proclaim to be the Maar to the Emperor's divinity. The republicans, terrified of the resurgent empire, has fallen in line behind Ferdinand Dawnclaw alongside countless Herzlander traitors who would rather throw in their lot with this heretic than face the emperor's justice. Of all the sacriledge we have seen, nothing comes even close to this treasonous general and his blatant heresies!"
 imperium.11.a:0 "The only reaction to treachery is vengeance!"
 imperium.11.b:0 "Death to the Corpse Emperor!"

 imperium.3000.title:0 "Knowledge Is Power"
 imperium.3000.desc:0 "The throne room in the palace was filled with the resonating boom of a proclaiming, bassy voice as the Emperor finished his latest demands for information. A small troop of functionaries scuttled away in quite the hurry, eager to facilitate the request for knowledge. Albrecht Deftplume was one of these low level bureaucrats and information-mongers. The griffon darted this way and that, practically diving his way through the palace to find the administration records that were needed to placate his liege lord.\n\n"It must be here, I'm sure of it. Maybe here, or over there?" Albrecht muttered, almost seeming possessed with a near-divine thirst to find the knowledge he knew was somewhere in the pile of records in this particular annex. A number of scrolls were nearly thrown out of the way as Albrecht scrabbled, driven with a zeal to find that which had been requested. What irked him more was that he knew where the scrolls were, but could he lay a claw on them right at this moment, right at the time when they were needed? Of course not, and that was the infuriating part! Why was it always the case that the things one wanted to find or read were the in the most out of the way place?\n\nFinally, after what felt like a lesser eternity, Albrecht saw the coded scroll markers that indicated he'd found the document series he needed. With a small caw of exultation, he snatched at the small bundle of scrolls and peered through one or two in order to confirm these were correct.\n\n Yes, yes. Infrastructure reports, familial histories of the Empire in the recent decades, technical records for standard equipment and even diplomatic records from meetings with the other Reichspakt states. Intriguing. Still, there were all the things the Emperor had demanded. Hurridly, the griff burst back out of the archives and to the throne room.\n\nPausing for just a moment outside the doors, he pat his head and tried to make himself look a little presentable, and after wiping off a little flopsweat he bowed his head in a supplicatory manner to enter and approach his liege." #Mara
 imperium.3000.a:0 "Guard it well."

imperium.3001.title:0 "There is only the Emperor"
imperium.3001.desc:0 "In the wake of the emperor's return, nobody had been more relieved than prince Grover VI. Though he had been evacuated as the fog struck the capitol and taken to the Strawberry Duchy, the events had left its mark on the young boy. Night after night, he had tossed and turned in his dreams, haunted by visions of a blinding light. As the fog faded and the emperor's survival was confirmed, the nightmares faded, but the toll they had extracted from the boy didn't.\n\nRetrieved from the Duchy by the Bronze Custodians, he was escorted into the throne room towards his father. The little chick looked in worry and fear up at the sight, shying away from the bright light of the emperor's eyes.\n\n"YOU HAVE SEEN IT TOO, MY CHILD," the emperor's voice was as powerful as before, yet soothing in way none else had experienced. "BLOOD SPOKE TO BLOOD, AND YOU KNOW YOUR ROLE. COME." He beckoned to his son, who hesitantly came up towards him and with some effort clamored up into the seat with him. Embracing his father, who reciprocated, the little prince closed his eyes tightly as the emperor looked down at him.\n\nA single, golden teardrop fell from the emperor's eye, landing on his son before the light spread from it across the child's entire frame. For a few seconds, the child glowed like a sun in his father's claws, and the next he was gone. Slowly lowering his claws back to their rests, the emperor slowly sat up straight, unmoving and unflinching."

 imperium.3002.desc:0 "To Gabriela Eagleclaw, playing the political game was the art of adapting no matter what happened, and to turn the events that came to pass to your advantage. Every deal, every agreement and every whispered word was a potential card in your claw, and it was a game that never ended, even if the board was reshuffled occasionally. Her cousin's death was meant to have been one of those reshufflings. Gabriela's dear, frail cousin had struggled all his life, and as he lay on his death bed, Gabriela had known that there would be a desperate scramble for power centered around his son. The game that had been set up would have been between her and that damned archon... and yet now the board had been thrown from the table, and the pieces were scattered all over the floor.\n\nMadness was being piled atop madness. Not only had her cousin supposedly not died, that device he was plugged into had reanimated him into something abominable. It was like an evil spirit from the depths of nightmare, a bloodthirsty tyrant who demanded absolute subjugation, even of her! The careful political weave she had woven for decades lay in tatters, and that... thing inside her cousin had even done the gods knew what to his son!\n\nStaring towards the south from her balcony, she knew that they would soon come. When it did, she was the sole remaining member of the Grover lineage. That demon had make sure of that, and she would not let him have the rest of it, no matter the cost." #Sweet

 imperium.3003.title:0 "The Arch-Traitor"
 imperium.3003.desc:0 ""THE REWARDS OF TOLERANCE ARE TREACHERY AND BETRAYAL." The Emperor's voice rang with fury, and the light in his eyes flickered like fire. "THE AMBITIONS OF THAT TRAITOR WERE CLEAR, AND YET HE WAS GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF. THIS IS WHAT HE WROUGHT IN RESPONSE. NOW EVERY TRAITOR, REVOLUTIONARY AND DEFIANT NOBLE IN THE REALM IS FLOCKING TO HIM. EVERY VOICE THAT WOULD DENY THIS IMPERIUM ITS RIGHTFUL DESTINY AND THROW THE CONTINENT INTO AN ERA OF CHAOS."\n\n"All loyal servants rage with you, my emperor," the once sergeant, now captain of the Bronze Custodians, told him. "But if your humble servant may. Could this be a blessing in disguise? All those traitors in one place means that if they are destroyed, we'll have cut the head off the serpent."\n\n"WHAT HE HAS WROUGHT IS BEYOND TREASON. IN HIS MADNESS, HE PROCLAIMS HIMSELF A CHAMPION OF MAAR. NOW HE HAS BIRTHED AN IDEA, ONE AS DEEPLY TWISTED AS HIS DISEASED MIND CAN CONCEIVE. FOR EVERY BLOODTHIRSTY CULTIST HE CALLS TO HIS BANNER, ANOTHER WEED IS PLANTED IN HIS WAKE. THEIR ROOTS BURIES DEEP INTO THE DARKNESS, FURTHER THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE, AND THOUGH YOU CAN PRUNE THE WEED OR RIP IT OUT, EVEN A SMALL SHARD OF ITS ROOTS LEFT IN PLACE MEANS IT WILL GROW AGAIN AND AGAIN. EVEN THE STEMS TORN OUT CARRY SEEDS THAT WILL SPROUT WHEREVER THEY FIND SOIL. IT MUST BE DESTROYED, UTTERLY AND DOWN TO THE LAST SOUL PLEDGED TO IT, FOR AS LONG AS HIS IDEA IS KNOWN, IT WILL HAUNT THIS EMPIRE."\n\n"Then we will tear them out, my emperor, down to the last.

 imperium.4000.d:0 "The doors to the throne room exploded open, and through the smoke and dust Dawnclaw strode in, sword in claw. Two bronze custodians charged him, yet he sidestepped them and cut them down with snakelike speed, leaving only the corpse on its gilded throne.\n\nMarching towards the gilded throne, Dawnclaw saw the light coalesce around the corpse-emperor and lash out at him, yet he ignored it. His hatred was too strong, and a choking darkness burst out around him to devour the light. With almost ecstatic glee, he lashed out to strike down another bolt of light as the darkness spread more and more through the chamber, and as he strode up the steps to the throne, the emperor had become like a single light in a sea of darkness.\n\n"You should have remained dead, you old corpse." Grasping the emperor by the throat, he tore him off the throne and raised him high into the air. "I would leave you alive and watch as I break your imperium piece by piece, but I've waited for this too long!" Clenching his claw, he savoured the sound of breaking cartilage and bone as the corpse finally went limp in his grasp.\n\nThrowing the corpse down the stairs, Warmaster Dawnclaw turned around as the Void Knights came into the throne room behind him.

He was down on his knees, struggling to get up, His entire body felt like lead, and he looked around himself. His warriors were still fighting, yet dying one after another as bolzen rounds ripped through them. Grenades exploded to his left, tearing a barricade to shreds and sending several fighter into the air. A void knight charged against the approaching figures only to be stopped in his tracks as a gleaming glaive impaled him.\n\nA massive boot kicked the void knight's limp body away to reveal bronzed armor and bared fangs: the Captain of the Bronze Custodians. The towering dog slowly approached him, his face twisted in contempt as he raised the glaive again. Dawnclaw shrieked in wild rage, a guttural, animal sound, and hate gave him strength where his body failed. He charged, moving like a speeding truck, and crashed against the custodian with a wild two-clawed swing. The dog grunted, being pushed back over a meter, but Dawnclaw's sword only met the plated shaft of the Custodian's glaive.\n\nScreaming in frustration as he was pushed back, Dawnclaw charged again, swinging his sword wildly only to have every blow picked out of the air by his opponent's whirling glaive, and out of nowhere the butt of the staff flew out, striking into his chest with enough force to make his entire body jerk. Gasping, he slowly sank down to the ground as the air was knocked out of him and he found himself unable to move.\n\n"Now die as you deserve, traitor." The guard captain said as he walked to the side, raising his glaive up to the sky. Dawnclaw's talons bit into the blasted earth beneath his fingers as he tried to make himself move!

Blindingly fast, it became immediately apparent that the creatures responsible were no usual undead, which itself would already be a great heresy. These things seemed to accelerate with every leap, bound, and rhythmic chant that came with their arrival.\n\nIf we do not respond quickly, then it is doubtful that even the full might of the Imperium of Griffonkind might be able to stop them.

It is the nature of all creatures to search for a light in the darkness, and as long as they can find hope, they will rise up again.\n\nWe shall teach them that this darkness is endless, and they will learn of it the hard way. We will track down their sources of joy and defiance, and we will make the most horrifying example of them there can be. Their elders and leaders, their village priests and voices of reason, all will be dragged screaming and pleading for their lives to the altars, where they will be made proper examples of. Yet what more, as it is their children and parents, their spouses and their friends holding the knives, they will both know true despair.\n\nThere is no emperor, there is only the Warmaster. There are no gods, there is only Maar. There are no dreams, only nightmares. There is no sanity, there is only madness!"

 imperium_4002_region_0_t_GRI:0 "Suffer not the Heretic to Live"
 imperium_4002_region_0_d_GRI:0 "The north has been a nest of witchcraft and heresy since time immemorial. From the savages in the high mountains and frozen wastes to the republicans and errant nations, not to mention Dawnclaw's treasonous uprising. All these false ideals has been allowed to grow out of control, and the result has shown itself all too clearly. The Holy Inquisition has deployed to purge this region, and all the forces at its disposal are called to serve at their utmost.. The last republican leaders are being hunted down one after another, the tribal leaders who thought themselves beyond the God-Emperor are humbled and the shamans and witches of the far edges of the north are having their primitive tricks exposed.\n\nThe pyres of the Holy Inquisition burn bright, illuminating the dark nights, and those worthy of redemption under the Inquisition are marched to their awaiting penitence. The heretical literature and teachings spread throughout the land is put to the torch, with only select copies being escorted back to holy Griffenheim to be placed under lock and key in the Basilica of Secrets."
 imperium_4002_region_0_a_GRI:0 "We purge these lands of heresy."
 imperium_4002_region_2_t_GRI:0 "The Servant's Greatest Sin is Pride"
 imperium_4002_region_2_d_GRI:0 "The Aquileians are proud like few, and they are not a people easily broken. They take pride in their history and in their legends, and have deluded themselves into believing that they stand apart from the imperium. This delusion cannot stand, and the Aquileians shall be humbled. Their history is one of defiance, and defiance is treason. All those who would lead their kin against us must be put to the sword - not the least the Discrets - and the very memory of their existence must be erased from all documents.\n\nThe Holy Inquisition is cracking down across the region, burning or removing the Aquileians' sources of pride. Some are being surrendered without issue, others demand the assisstance of the God-Emperor's Star Knights, more specifically the Order of the Hammer. It is a long, drawn out process that will take years and indeed decades, yet in due time, all that will remains will be little more than fairy tales dismissed as fanciful myths only."
 imperium_4002_region_2_a_GRI:0 "Their delusions have gone on long enough."
 imperium_4002_region_3_t_GRI:0 "The Bulls of the Inquisition"
 imperium_4002_region_3_d_GRI:0 "The debased sins of the southwest range far and wide, and the Holy Inquisition's task is great. Not only has these lands been home to some of the oldest and most deep-seated defiances against the God-Emperor, but the anarchy of the Blackrock mountains runs deep. If these lands are to be purged of heretical defiance, they must be cowed thoroughly.\n\nFortunately, the Holy Inquisition has found an unlikely ally. The minotaurs of Asterion have stood defiant against all for centuries, but before the wrath of the God-Emperor, these bovines have wisely decided to bow their heads. After an agreement reached between their leaders and Inquisitor Eisenklaue, they have sworn to become the fist of the Inquisition, and their best soldiers have been pledged to strike wherever is needed. The Minotaurs are now one of the Empire's deadliest weapons, and one that can easily be turned against foes within as well as without."
 imperium_4002_region_3_a_GRI:0 "Go forth, Brazen Bulls of the Emperor."
 imperium_4002_region_4_t_GRI:0 "Bringing the Emperor's Light into the Forgotten Valley"
 imperium_4002_region_4_d_GRI:0 "The errant petty kingdoms of the Evi Valley have been allowed to play at independence for too long, and the consequences are all too clear. Traitorous knightly orders believing themselves endowed with the right to abandon their oaths and lands riven by heretical socialism and petty tyranny, when they have not fallen to simple disunion and division like the cossacks or the so-called "free states". The freedom these lands praised are nothing but attempts to escape their rightful place at the emperor's side, and the Holy Inquisition will educate them.\n\nBy fire and steel, the authority of the god-emperor is established. Some are choosing to fight to the death, but they are being taught that there was no glory in these acts, only suffering. Meanwhile, those who have been wise enough to bow before their rightful ruler and remember the oaths that once held sway over their land are granted clemency. The Inquisitorial agents of the Order of the Chain will ensure their further compliance where needed."
 imperium_4002_region_4_a_GRI:0 "They strayed from the God-Emperor, but they can earn forgiveness."
 imperium_4002_region_5_t_GRI:0 "The Triumphant Crusade East"
 imperium_4002_region_5_d_GRI:0 "The creatures of the east are no strangers to war and suffering. They have stood as one of the biggest and most constant threats to the Imperium of Griffonkind since its very inception, and the blood of an emperor is on their hooves. This conflict has no place in the Imperum, and the Holy Inquisition's work here is not to ensure their loyalty, but their compliance. Their lands are not griffon lands, and if they are wise enough to bow, the God-Emperor will consider the matter settled.\n\nSeizing their key leaders and spiriting them away to secret interrogation chambers, we are breaking them one after one. Faced with the full fury of Griffonkind, the Riverponies and their ilk have already seen the hopelessness of resistance. Now they will be educated in the price of defiance. Understanding wholly what will happen if they dare to rise up again and the hopelessness of their struggle, they will return to their peoples as broken creatures, but they will ensure peace in the east."
 imperium_4002_region_5_a_GRI:0 "Bow before the God-Emperor, and he will show you mercy!"
 imperium_4002_region_1_t_FAT:0 "A Throne of Skulls"
 imperium_4002_region_1_d_FAT:0 "The fetid corpse of the empire lies before our forces, and yet even now there are those who presume to think they could still stand against us. And why wouldn't they? The false emperor tried to make them believe that they were owed a continent, when all they were owed was humiliation. These lands and the griffs in them are swollen with arrogance, but a tortured griff will in the end do anything to make it stop, and we will torture the arrogance out of this land.\n\nWe strike without mercy from the darkness, butchering entire villages and towns that even dared to whisper of defiance, and we line the roads with their bodies as a warning to everycreature else. Through terror, we will reduce them to panicked animals, and they will in the end crawl before our black evangelists, cradling their loved ones and swearing fealthy just to make it stop."
 imperium_4002_region_1_a_FAT:0 "Our water is blood, our food is flesh!"
 imperium_4002_region_2_t_FAT:0 "The Endless Ecstasy of Surrender"
 imperium_4002_region_2_d_FAT:0 "Oh how prideful the Aquileians are, and oh how easy they are to lead by the beak to wherever we need them. They would gladly fight beak and claw to resist us, even through hopelessness, so why then give them that? We won't give them cause to fight, only to celebrate. Indulging their local leaders and letting them think they are in control, we will let them go about playing at self-determination only to slowly make them rot from within.\n\nWe will gladly share our Void Knight technology with their leaders, and yet as they accept our dark gifts they will start to hear what we hear, and understand what we understand. We will let wild celebration flow through the streets of their cities, and whip them into drug fuelled frenzies where blood will end up flowing. They will be drowned in indulgence and excess, and their precious principles will atrophy under waves of bliss as they break themselves for us."
 imperium_4002_region_2_a_FAT:0 "They will get everything, and they will lose it."
 imperium_4002_region_3_t_FAT:0 "A Thousand Shadowed Paths"
 imperium_4002_region_3_d_FAT:0 "The karthinian lands have been home to empires since long before the Herzland was anything more than simple tribes, and the history here runs deep. The very birthplace of griffonkind nests in the high peaks of these lands, and why would they not defend them? They know what they have, they know what has been and they know what can come, and were not our entire uprising against the corpse-emperor about refusing to be denied our potential?\n\nInstead of trying to cow these lands, we whisper in the ears of their political and religious leaders to offer them things they could only ever have dreamed of. Their deepest, darkest desires, their thirst for forbidden knowledge and their dreams beyond their station, all will be possible in this new world. They will in the end gladly trade away their responsibilities, their loyalty, their very families, all to have it. And when all are in a mad scramble for power, nocreature trusts any else, and then they will be easy to control."
 imperium_4002_region_3_a_FAT:0 "They don't know the true price of curiosity."
 imperium_4002_region_4_t_FAT:0 "The Tainted Bounty"
 imperium_4002_region_4_d_FAT:0 "Resting in the shadow beyond the Blackrock mountains these little nations have managed to avoid the attention of their betters for a long time. They've grown complacent where they lie, feeding off the great Evi river. It is their mother, so what then will they do when she turns on them? When diseases and poisons fill the waters, and that which brought them life now brings death, what will the poor little griffs of these forgotten lands do?\n\nIn the end, they will come to our embrace, and they will gladly surrender their obstinate kin to us as we feed and shelter them when nocreature else can. We will teach them to not fear and hate the diseased, but to embrace them. They will live, they will prosper, and they will do so through our gifts, and those ingrates who would reject the bounties we offer them will be torn apart by those our new children who know better."
 imperium_4002_region_4_a_FAT:0 "They are such obedient children."
 imperium_4002_region_5_t_FAT:0 "The Eye of Horror"
 imperium_4002_region_5_d_FAT:0 "Defiance... pride... they infest the east, and the creatures here think they are our peers instead of our prey. The weakling Grover II failed miserably when he marched east, but we now stand where emperors failed. Ponies, diamond dogs, even deer and zebras, the uproarious freak show that is the east knows no limits, and so we entertain ourselves. By madness and poison, by carnage and excess, we raze all that they have ever built, leaving only howling ruins and empty husks in our wake.\n\nLet them run, let them try to gather again and again for desperate last stands as our legions swarm them and rip them apart as they scream for mercy. Let them dig deep to escape only to have corroding poisons pumped into their precious tunnels to choke them. Let them try to escape across the seas as our planes blow them to pieces. And what more let them begin to recover as we return to do it again and again and again."

All who thought they could deny us our destiny have been taught the error of their ways, and now bow before the continent's one, true ruler; the God-Emperor of Griffonkind!\n\nReborn in the Imperium's darkest hour, he was the guiding light that drove us to purify the broken and decrepit empire. He was the will behind our legions as we manifested the destiny promised to Griffonkind, and we proved ourselves worthy of His blessings! Under his watchful eyes and wielding the divine tools granted us by the Eternal Archrector - he who was martyred for the Imperium - we are ascendant!

Their ignorant dreams and whining pleas for mercy are like ashes in the wind, and there is nothing but chaos across the continent. Their kings and presidents are gutted like animals, their preachers and priests now sing the praises of darkness, and their existence is an unending nightmare from which there is only one escape; the dark enlightenment of Maar.\n\nBeyond despair, beyond suffering and beyond madness lies a realm of untold promises, and though millions will break long before they can reach it, we will herd the weaklings into it again and again. Greatness, even divinity, awaits those with the ambition to reach for it, and we have a continent's worth of blood and souls to pay with."
