The University of Gamia has just informed us that they have been working on a secretive project that is nearing completion. The project is concerned with offering life support and indeed revitalization for the severely ill. Due to the massive power requirements needed, the project has not managed to finish the clinical stage, and it is only the emperor's critical condition that has made the researchers offer their aid.\n\nThe suggestion is extraordinary, absurd almost, but they are offering to attempt putting his majesty into the device they have developed and empower it with all the magic that the empire can spare. If their calculations are correct, then his majesty may well recover from his long-standing illness. There is no way of knowing what the the side effects will be - their experiments thus far have been limited to rodents and the like - but as his majesty is fading fast, maybe it should be considered?"
