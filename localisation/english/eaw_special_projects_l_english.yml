 sp_land_manpads_desc: "A creature-portable anti-air missile allows for infantry to have a fighting chance at frightening off or damaging enemy CAS."
 sp_land_heavy_sam: "Heavy SAMs"
 sp_land_heavy_sam_desc: "With enemy bombers getting ever deadlier and faster, a strong response is required. Deploying the best anti-air missiles we have throughout our army will make striking our troops a truly daunting task."
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension: "Hydropneumatic Suspension"
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension_desc: "The ultimate in tank suspension, by using a combination of liquids and gasses we can create a reliable, fast, and stealthy system."

Theoretically, this would be able to vaporize enemy ICBMs before impact."
 sp_rockets_air_to_air_missile: "Air-to-Air Missile"

 ### Generic Projects ###

 sp_magical_telekinetic_fields: "Induced Telekinetic Fields"
 sp_magical_telekinetic_fields_desc: "Inspired largely by the telekinetic abilities of several different species, the concept behind induced telekinetic fields - colloquially known simply as ‘shield generators’ - is very simple. The aim is to replicate the ability to create a solid shield out of magic in much the same way as a unicorn might and automate the process so that it can be implemented in vehicle systems where such a system’s portability is less of a concern."

 tech_magical_telekinetic_field_plane: "Plane Shield Projectors"
 plane_shield_module: "Telekinetic Shield Projector"

 sp_magical_assisted_quarries: "Magic-Assisted Quarries"
 sp_magical_assisted_quarries_desc: "Mining is an awful business. Certainly there are some creatures who yearn for the dark and sooty pits that we call safe workplaces, but the vast majority are rightfully unwilling to delve into - let alone operate machinery inside - such an environment. It seems only sensible that these are some of the first places that we experiment with magical machinery on a mass scale, be it in augmented drills or some level of automation in bringing material to the surface."

 tech_magical_quarry: "Magitech Quarry Installations"

 sp_magical_supply_organisation: "Magical Supply Organisation"
 sp_magical_supply_organisation_desc: "Any soldier who has worked in maintenance will gladly inform you of the value of a properly organised stockpile, but there’s only so efficient the vast majority of soldiers - especially conscripts - can realistically be. Having some variety of magically-assisted sorting machinery that does the time consuming organisation of surplus materiel and directs it to the correct individual or towards the appropriate storage location will make our lives considerably easier."

 tech_magical_depot_organisation_supply_grace: "Time Slowed Rations"
 sp_magical_supply_organisation_special_forces_supply_grace_choice: "Hyper-Energy Bars"

 sp_magical_imperceptibility_studies: "Magic Imperceptability Studies"
 sp_magical_imperceptibility_studies_desc: "Although somewhat controversial, the idea of using spells to make soldiers and operatives more difficult to perceive even in plain sight is obviously a concept that garners a lot of interest. We have found ways of using spells to manipulate the way light travels towards and bounces off items of clothing which could present opportunities for the technology’s practical implementation, although it has proven somewhat challenging to keep track of said clothes after their enchantment."

 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies: "Thaumatic Agency Department"
 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies_offensive: "Enchanted Operative Equipment"
 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies_defensive: "Enchanted Detection Tools"

 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys: "Thaumaturgical Encryption Keys"
 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_desc: "Using an encryption key to encode and subsequently ungarble what might otherwise look like utter nonsense is nothing new in the field of information warfare. What makes this particular project interesting is the application of unique low-energy magic that can be used to interpret and subsequently scramble coded messages using spells only known to select individuals. As of now it’s not known whether a brute force method - even a machine assisted one - could ever be used to break such methods of encryption."

 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_encryption: "Mind-Palace Abjuration Spell"

 sp_magical_force_multiplication: "Magical Force Multiplication"
 sp_magical_force_multiplication_desc: "For many, magical weaponry has already become the next logical step in modern warfare. Traditional firearms and support weapons remain more practical to produce en masse for the time being, but the introduction of especially potent battalion-level formations equipped with fully magirised materiel have proven to be effective force multipliers in the short-term. There is no doubt that this support element will provide a significant tactical edge on the battlefield."

 tech_magical_shock_company: "All-Magical Shock Company"
 magical_shock_company: "All-Magical Shock Company"

 sp_magical_synthetic_mineral_growth: "Synthetic Mineral Growth"
 sp_magical_synthetic_mineral_growth_desc: "Synthetic crystal manufacturing has been a possibility since the 900s, but was never pursued on an industrial scale. In the past it was only done by small businesses - usually in an effort to pass off their products as real for quick profits - but now that we understand the true potential in crystals there are new reasons to pursue their mass manufacture. The trickiest part will be trying to induce the energies present in naturally occurring crystals, but with enough determination and several replaced blast shields we will find a way."

 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses: "Thaumaturgical Diagnoses"
 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses_desc: "Letting creatures diagnose themselves has always been problematic for doctors and general practitioners, if not for the almost constant inaccuracies then for the additional anxiety that said diagnoses typically cause. Pre-packaged diagnostic packages with instructions alongside a selection bewitched tools and substances will have a comparable impact to first-aid kits for both soldiers on the frontline and creatures at home, allowing our citizens to get accurate and detailed diagnoses from the comfort of their own home; or indeed from the discomfort of a trench."
 sp_thaumaturgical_diagnoses: "Mass-Scale Diagnosation & Treatment"
 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses_pop_growth: "101-Diagnosises Home Kit"

 sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles: "Energy Shatter Crystal Projectiles"
 sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles_desc: "Although crystals typically carry a somewhat containable amount of energy which requires considerable effort to release, it seems as though it is possible - particularly with large crystals - to force additional energy inside them. The more energy contained, the more fragile the crystal and the greater propensity it has for detonating spectacularly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some bright minds had the genius idea of turning these concerningly volatile crystals into projectile weapons that detonate shortly after impacting a surface like a HEAT or HESH shell."

 pegasus_void_suit: "Pegasus Void Suit"

 ### Griffon Projects ###

 sp_heavy_knight_armor: "Magitech Knight Armour"
 sp_heavy_knight_armor_desc: "Despite its cultural significance and the many design iterations made over the years, current knight armour remains a largely traditional military uniform which is exactly as heavy and restrictive as it looks. In the modern era of tanks and mechanised infantry, the amount of protection this equipment can offer an individual is simply redundant; especially when weighed against its drawbacks. The time has come for something more protective, something that enhances a user’s mobility and something that provides a platform to operate modern heavy weapons."
 tech_magical_heavy_knight_armor: "Magitech Knight Armour"
 griffon_knight_armor: "Heavy Knight Armor"

 sp_universal_translator: "The Universal Translator"
 sp_explain_universal_translator: "Add §YUniversal Translator§! -idea, which grants bonuses depending how many significant regional capitals in Griffonia you or your puppets own. The regional capitals are as follows:\n — Griffenheim, Herzland:\n  - Division Organisation: +5.00%\n\n — Aquila, Aquileia:\n  - Research Speed: +2.5.00%\n\n — Karthin, Southern Griffonia:\n  - Resource Gain Efficiency: +10.00%\n\n — Griffonstone, Central Griffonia:\n  - Daily Political Power: +0.1\n  - Stability: +10%\n\n — Sydia, Evil Valley:\n  - Monthly Population: +15.00%\n\n — Cloudbury, Northern Griffonia:\n  - Supply Consumption: -5.0%"

 griffon_universal_translator_modifier: "Universal Translator"
 griffon_universal_translator_modifier_desc: "Griffons are perhaps the most linguistically diverse species on the entire planet. It is no surprise - for this and for other reasons - that historically we have relied more on conflict than conversation to resolve our disputes. To make some headway in rectifying this, scientists have proposed that a correctly enchanted radio headset and microphone could allow our kind to properly communicate regardless of their native language. Future miniaturisations of the technology could also produce a more compact device, but for now we’ll settle for putting magitech inside our existing military radio equipment."

 ### Zebra Projects ###

 sp_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 sp_alchemical_toolbelt_desc: "True to its name, this project is less one of theory and more one of application. Alchemical packs are a fairly common accessory for trained alchemists already, but for soldiers and untrained conscripts in particular it’s much more challenging to create a toolbelt of regularly used concoctions and ingredients. Beyond its use we must also consider its safety as glass beakers that you might see in a more scientific setting tend not to enjoy the roughshod nature of combat. We’ll have to draw up some new hardy and chemically unreactive containers."
 tech_magical_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 zebra_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"

 sp_starmetal: "Synthetical Starmetal Alloy"
 sp_starmetal_desc: "TOOD zebra smits in past used rare meteors for various alloys dubbed starmetal. Known for their durability and hardness, they were highly sought by rulers. Their rarity, due to needing meteors, made them largely unaccessible at a larger scale in armies but recent innovations in metallurgy among the smiths has shown a way to potentially artificially synthesize similar compounds found in the rare meteors. If discovered, then starmetal can be mass produced."
 tech_magical_starmetal: "Starmetal"

 ### Hippogriff Projects ###

 sp_underwater_rail_infrastructure: "Underwater Rail Infrastructure"
 sp_underwater_rail_infrastructure_desc: "TODO hippogriffs use new construction tech and their innate underwater building expertise to create deep-sea infrstrcture projects to enable expansion of Seaquestria."

 ### Changeling Projects ###

 ### Kirin Projects ###

 sp_grand_astrological_orrery: "Grand Astrological Orrery"
 sp_grand_astrological_orrery_desc: "Astrology has long been employed by kirin to interpret the signs of the stars and the seasons, so it stands to reason that we would pursue the construction of a grand orrery with which to perform even more detailed predictions of the future. It will - of course - utilise the relevant and most up-to-date star charts, numerological and probability calculations in order to maximise the accuracy and utility of whatever answers we may find to our many burning questions."

 ### Changeling Projects ###

 sp_camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 sp_camo_cloak_desc: "TODO a camo cloak design for changeling jager units. utlizies changeling magic to act to mimic surrounding terrain perfectly alike to an invicibility cloak."

 ### Deer Projects

 sp_spirit_grenades: "Spirit Grenade"
 sp_spirit_grenades_desc: "TODO concept of entrapping small, lesser spirit beings in containers which are then used as weapons by specialized grenadier companies. Upon release the angry spirit will then cause havoc among the enemy lines before disappearing."
 tech_spirit_grenadiers: "Spirit Grenadiers"
 spirit_grenade: "Spirit Grenade"
 spirit_grenadier_company: "Spirit Grenadiers"

 sp_long_term_tactical_divination: "Long-Term Strategic Divination"
 sp_long_term_tactical_divination_desc: "Whilst seers have historically afforded our soldiers a significant amount of tactical insight, the nature of their visions prevents them from generating useful information at a meaningful rate and at convenient times. Instead it has been theorised that we can apply their visions to a grander strategy, collecting as many seers as possible in one place and collating the information provided in order to formulate a pinpoint plan for the future. It has been suggested that we could introduce a variety of stimuli to experiment with speeding up the process, but for now at least we shall be satisfied by developing a proper system of collective visionary documentation."
 tech_long_term_tactical_divination: "All Tomorrow's Battleplans"
 sp_long_term_tactical_divination_tp: "Every new commander will also receive this bonus."

 ### Diamond Dog Projects

 sp_tunnel_drill: "Assault Tunnel Vehicle"

 sp_news.1.t: "The Universal Translator"
 sp_news.1.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]With the advent of magitech in military and civilian life, it was only a matter of time before something truly groundbreaking was invented. The Universal Translator - as it has been named - is a complex arrangement of magitech and so-called ‘enchanted strings’ inside a radio headset that allows audio input to be translated near-instantaneously into the native tongue of the listener. Griffons from all over have already expressed interest in the system and the companies responsible for its creation have enjoyed a meteoric rise in stock prices."
