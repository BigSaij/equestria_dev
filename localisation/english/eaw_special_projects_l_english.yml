 sp_land_infantry_fighting_vehicles: "Infantry Fighting Vehicles"
 sp_land_infantry_fighting_vehicles_desc: "Mechanized infantry has become a cornerstone of our army. But by mounting an autocannon and installing firing ports on an APC, we could drastically increase our infantry's effectiveness, allowing them to use the vehicle as cover and firepower."
 sp_land_manpads: "CREPADS"
 sp_land_manpads_desc: "A creature-portable anti-air missile allows for infantry to have a fighting chance at frightening off or damaging enemy CAS."
 sp_land_heavy_sam: "Heavy SAMs"
 sp_land_heavy_sam_desc: "With enemy bombers getting ever deadlier and faster, a strong response is required. Deploying the best anti-air missiles we have throughout our army will make striking our troops a truly daunting task."
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension: "Hydropneumatic Suspension"
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension_desc: "The ultimate in tank suspension, by using a combination of liquids and gasses we can create a reliable, fast, and stealthy system."
 sp_land_composite_armor: "Composite Armor"
 sp_land_composite_armor_desc: "As HEAT shells become more and more common, a new defense is required for our tanks. The idea of inserting silica glass between rolled steel is appealing, though it will likely prove expensive."
 sp_land_advanced_modern_turret: "Advanced Modern Turret"
 sp_land_advanced_modern_turret_desc: "As tanks continue to engage at farther and farther ranges, a modernized version of the modern turret is appealing. It would be able to mount even guns once restricted to super-heavy tanks, as well as allowing higher visibility."

 ANTI_AIR_INFANTRY_BOOST: "All Infantry and Motorized/Mechanized will gain a small amount of §YAir Attack§!."

 sp_rockets_anti_ballistic_missile: "Anti-Ballistic Missile"
 sp_rockets_anti_ballistic_missile_desc: "With the new, terrifying age of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, a daunting proposal has reached us: mounting nuclear warheads on our alrgest surface-to-air missiles. Theoretically, this would be able to vaporize enemy ICBMs before impact."

 sp_naval_supercarrier: "Supercarrier"
 sp_naval_supercarrier_desc: "The ultimate in naval power projection, a Supercarrier would be capable of holding many more planes than even the largest of our current carriers. Of course, it would also cost far more."

 sp_air_super_large_airframe: "Super Large Airframe"
 sp_air_super_large_airframe_desc:0 "The idea of a Super-Large Airframe has long been a dream of our more radical scientists: a bomber so massive it is virtually indestructable by anything short of an enemy nuclear anti-air missile, carrying so many bombs nothing can survive a bombardment."
 sp_land_radar_3: "AEW&C"
 sp_land_radar_3_desc: "An Airborne Early Warning and Control system, essentially a flying radar array, would allow for early detection of enemy nuclear strikes, thus providing precious time for our citizens to get to safety. It would also help with locating enemy planes in adverse weather."
 sp_land_radar_4: "Over-the-Horizon Radar"
 sp_land_radar_4_desc: "Perhaps the ultimate in long-range radar, Over-the-Horizon would be capable of detecting the enemy from extreme distances by bouncing radar waves off the ionosphere."
