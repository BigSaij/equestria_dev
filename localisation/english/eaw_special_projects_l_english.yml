 sp_land_infantry_fighting_vehicles: "Infantry Fighting Vehicles"
 sp_land_infantry_fighting_vehicles_desc: "Mechanized infantry has become a cornerstone of our army. But by mounting an autocannon and installing firing ports on an APC, we could drastically increase our infantry's effectiveness, allowing them to use the vehicle as cover and firepower."
 sp_land_manpads: "CREPADS"
 sp_land_manpads_desc: "A creature-portable anti-air missile allows for infantry to have a fighting chance at frightening off or damaging enemy CAS."
 sp_land_heavy_sam: "Heavy SAMs"
 sp_land_heavy_sam_desc: "With enemy bombers getting ever deadlier and faster, a strong response is required. Deploying the best anti-air missiles we have throughout our army will make striking our troops a truly daunting task."
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension: "Hydropneumatic Suspension"
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension_desc: "The ultimate in tank suspension, by using a combination of liquids and gasses we can create a reliable, fast, and stealthy system."
 sp_land_composite_armor: "Composite Armor"
 sp_land_composite_armor_desc: "As HEAT shells become more and more common, a new defense is required for our tanks. The idea of inserting silica glass between rolled steel is appealing, though it will likely prove expensive."
 sp_land_advanced_modern_turret: "Advanced Modern Turret"
 sp_land_advanced_modern_turret_desc: "As tanks continue to engage at farther and farther ranges, a modernized version of the modern turret is appealing. It would be able to mount even guns once restricted to super-heavy tanks, as well as allowing higher visibility."

 ANTI_AIR_INFANTRY_BOOST: "All Infantry and Motorized/Mechanized will gain a small amount of §YAir Attack§!."

 sp_clean_nuclear_bomb: "Low-Fallout Nuclear Bomb"
 sp_clean_nuclear_bomb_desc: "A low-yield and relatively 'clean' bomb, still capable of vaporizing enemy tanks and airfields while not leaving excessive lingering radiation, has come to our attention. Ideal for tactical use, this would increase our versatility significantly."
 CLEAN_NUCLEAR_BOMB_TT: "When deploying an §YAtomic Bomb§!, §Gthe Nuclear Fallout will be shorter and less severe.§!"

 sp_cobalt_bomb: "Salted Thermonuclear Bomb"
 sp_cobalt_bomb_desc: "Even the thermonuclear bomb now may be outclassed, as a disturbing new proposal has come to us: the creation of a radiological weapon to deliberately create huge amounts of fallout. Such a weapon would expand its reach beyond the area targeted and irradiate a huge region. This weapon would grant tremendous clout to the one wielding it, though hopefully we'd never have to actually use it..."
 COBALT_BOMB_RADIATION_TT: "When deploying a §YThermonuclear Bomb§!, §Rall neighboring states will receive radiation as well.§!\n\n§YShould we irradiate a neutral country,§! §Rthey may retaliate.§!"

 sp_rockets_anti_ballistic_missile_desc: "With the new, terrifying age of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, a daunting proposal has reached us: mounting nuclear warheads on our largest surface-to-air missiles. Theoretically, this would be able to vaporize enemy ICBMs before impact."
 sp_rockets_air_to_air_missile: "Air-to-Air Missile"
 sp_rockets_air_to_air_missile_desc: "As electronics become smaller, the once-absurd idea of a guided missile able to be carried by a fighter is in reach of becoming real. This would also open the door to other guided munitions."
 sp_rockets_anti_radiation_missile: "Anti-Radiation Missile"
 sp_rockets_anti_radiation_missile_desc: "While the destructive power of our strike aircraft remains unmatched, they have unfortunately become more and more vulnerable as they carry more and more weaponry. An interesting solution has been proposed: a missile that will home in on active radar signals and destroy them. This would give our pilots a large amount of breathing room!"
 sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile: "Air-Launched Cruise Missile"
 sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile_desc: "Bombers still have to fly over enemy territory to deliver their payload, and static anti-air defenses are becoming dangerous once more. Mounting cruise missiles under the wing would allow for some preemptive destruction!"

 sp_air_advanced_jet_engine_desc: "A new design for jets promises to be even faster and more powerful, letting our jets fly further as well. However, it won't come cheap."
 sp_air_super_large_airframe: "Super Large Airframe"
 sp_air_super_large_airframe_desc:0 "The idea of a Super-Large Airframe has long been a dream of our more radical scientists: a bomber so massive it is virtually indestructable by anything short of an enemy nuclear anti-air missile, carrying so many bombs nothing can survive a bombardment."
 sp_land_radar_3: "AEW&C"
 sp_land_radar_3_desc: "An Airborne Early Warning and Control system, essentially a flying radar array, would allow for early detection of enemy nuclear strikes, thus providing precious time for our citizens to get to safety. It would also help with locating enemy planes in adverse weather."
 sp_land_radar_4: "Over-the-Horizon Radar"
 sp_land_radar_4_desc: "Perhaps the ultimate in long-range radar, Over-the-Horizon would be capable of detecting the enemy from extreme distances by bouncing radar waves off the ionosphere."
