 ### Generic Projects ###

 sp_magical_telekinetic_fields: "Induced Telekinetic Fields"
 sp_magical_telekinetic_fields_desc: "Inspired largely by the telekinetic abilities of several different species, the concept behind induced telekinetic fields - colloquially known simply as ‘shield generators’ - is very simple. The aim is to replicate the ability to create a solid shield out of magic in much the same way as a unicorn might and automate the process so that it can be implemented in vehicle systems where such a system’s portability is less of a concern."

 tech_magical_telekinetic_field_plane: "Plane Shield Projectors"
 plane_shield_module: "Telekinetic Shield Projector"

 sp_magical_assisted_quarries: "Magic-Assisted Quarries"
 sp_magical_assisted_quarries_desc: "Mining is an awful business. Certainly there are some creatures who yearn for the dark and sooty pits that we call safe workplaces, but the vast majority are rightfully unwilling to delve into - let alone operate machinery inside - such an environment. It seems only sensible that these are some of the first places that we experiment with magical machinery on a mass scale, be it in augmented drills or some level of automation in bringing material to the surface."

 tech_magical_quarry: "Magitech Quarry Installations"

 sp_magical_supply_organisation: "Magical Supply Organisation"
 sp_magical_supply_organisation_desc: "Any soldier who has worked in maintenance will gladly inform you of the value of a properly organised stockpile, but there’s only so efficient the vast majority of soldiers - especially conscripts - can realistically be. Having some variety of magically-assisted sorting machinery that does the time consuming organisation of surplus materiel and directs it to the correct individual or towards the appropriate storage location will make our lives considerably easier."

 tech_magical_depot_organisation_supply_grace: "Time Slowed Rations"
 tech_magical_depot_organisation_sf_supply_grace: "Hyper-Energy Bars"

 sp_magical_imperceptibility_studies: "Magic Imperceptability Studies"
 sp_magical_imperceptibility_studies_desc: "Although somewhat controversial, the idea of using spells to make soldiers and operatives more difficult to perceive even in plain sight is obviously a concept that garners a lot of interest. We have found ways of using spells to manipulate the way light travels towards and bounces off items of clothing which could present opportunities for the technology’s practical implementation, although it has proven somewhat challenging to keep track of said clothes after their enchantment."

 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies: "Thaumatic Agency Department"
 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies_offensive: "Enchanted Operative Equipment"
 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies_defensive: "Enchanted Detection Tools"

 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys: "Thaumaturgical Encryption Keys"
 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_desc: "Using an encryption key to encode and subsequently ungarble what might otherwise look like utter nonsense is nothing new in the field of information warfare. What makes this particular project interesting is the application of unique low-energy magic that can be used to interpret and subsequently scramble coded messages using spells only known to select individuals. As of now it’s not known whether a brute force method - even a machine assisted one - could ever be used to break such methods of encryption."

 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_decryption: "Mind-Illumination Clairvoyance Spell"
 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_encryption: "Mind-Palace Abjuration Spell"

 sp_magical_force_multiplication: "Magical Force Multiplication"
 sp_magical_force_multiplication_desc: "For many, magical weaponry has already become the next logical step in modern warfare. Traditional firearms and support weapons remain more practical to produce en masse for the time being, but the introduction of especially potent battalion-level formations equipped with fully magirised materiel have proven to be effective force multipliers in the short-term. There is no doubt that this support element will provide a significant tactical edge on the battlefield."

 tech_magical_shock_company: "All-Magical Shock Company"
 magical_shock_company: "All-Magical Shock Company"

 sp_magical_synthetic_mineral_growth: "Synthetic Mineral Growth"
 sp_magical_synthetic_mineral_growth_desc: "Synthetic crystal manufacturing has been a possibility since the 900s, but was never pursued on an industrial scale. In the past it was only done by small businesses - usually in an effort to pass off their products as real for quick profits - but now that we understand the true potential in crystals there are new reasons to pursue their mass manufacture. The trickiest part will be trying to induce the energies present in naturally occurring crystals, but with enough determination and several replaced blast shields we will find a way."

 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses: "Thaumaturgical Diagnoses"
 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses_desc: "Letting creatures diagnose themselves has always been problematic for doctors and general practitioners, if not for the almost constant inaccuracies then for the additional anxiety that said diagnoses typically cause. Pre-packaged diagnostic packages with instructions alongside a selection bewitched tools and substances will have a comparable impact to first-aid kits for both soldiers on the frontline and creatures at home, allowing our citizens to get accurate and detailed diagnoses from the comfort of their own home; or indeed from the discomfort of a trench."
 sp_thaumaturgical_diagnoses: "Mass-Scale Diagnosation & Treatment"
 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses_pop_growth: "101-Diagnosises Home Kit"

 sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles: "Energy Shatter Crystal Projectiles"
 sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles_desc: "Although crystals typically carry a somewhat containable amount of energy which requires considerable effort to release, it seems as though it is possible - particularly with large crystals - to force additional energy inside them. The more energy contained, the more fragile the crystal and the greater propensity it has for detonating spectacularly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some bright minds had the genius idea of turning these concerningly volatile crystals into projectile weapons that detonate shortly after impacting a surface like a HEAT or HESH shell."

 ### Pony Projects ###

 sp_cloud_carrier: "Cloud Based Naval Infrastructure"
 sp_cloud_carrier_desc: "TODO"

 sp_pegasi_void_suit: "Pegasi High-Altitude Gear"
 sp_pegasi_void_suit_desc: "Pegasi are capable of incredible feats of flight, but their bodies have limits. The realities of high-altitude flight prevent even the most athletic pegasus from flying without the assistance of a closed-cockpit aircraft. The Pegasus Void Suit is a flight suit that maintains the user's temperature, oxygen, and pressure levels, protecting them from hostile atmosphere conditions and allowing previously impossible operations at extreme altitudes."
 tech_magical_pegasus_void_suit: "Pegasi High-Altidute Gear"
 pegasus_void_suit: "Pegasus Void Suit"

 ### Griffon Projects ###

 sp_heavy_knight_armor: "Magitech Knight Armour"
 sp_heavy_knight_armor_desc: "Despite its cultural significance and the many design iterations made over the years, current knight armour remains a largely traditional military uniform which is exactly as heavy and restrictive as it looks. In the modern era of tanks and mechanised infantry, the amount of protection this equipment can offer an individual is simply redundant; especially when weighed against its drawbacks. The time has come for something more protective, something that enhances a user’s mobility and something that provides a platform to operate modern heavy weapons."
 tech_magical_heavy_knight_armor: "Magitech Knight Armour"
 griffon_knight_armor: "Heavy Knight Armor"

 sp_universal_translator: "The Universal Translator"
 sp_explain_universal_translator: "Add §YUniversal Translator§! -idea, which grants bonuses depending how many significant regional capitals in Griffonia you or your puppets own. The regional capitals are as follows:\n — Griffenheim, Herzland:\n  - Division Organisation: +5.00%\n\n — Aquila, Aquileia:\n  - Research Speed: +2.5.00%\n\n — Karthin, Southern Griffonia:\n  - Resource Gain Efficiency: +10.00%\n\n — Griffonstone, Central Griffonia:\n  - Daily Political Power: +0.1\n  - Stability: +10%\n\n — Sydia, Evil Valley:\n  - Monthly Population: +15.00%\n\n — Cloudbury, Northern Griffonia:\n  - Supply Consumption: -5.0%"

 griffon_universal_translator_modifier: "Universal Translator"
 griffon_universal_translator_modifier_desc: "Griffons are perhaps the most linguistically diverse species on the entire planet. It is no surprise - for this and for other reasons - that historically we have relied more on conflict than conversation to resolve our disputes. To make some headway in rectifying this, scientists have proposed that a correctly enchanted radio headset and microphone could allow our kind to properly communicate regardless of their native language. Future miniaturisations of the technology could also produce a more compact device, but for now we’ll settle for putting magitech inside our existing military radio equipment."

 ### Zebra Projects ###

 sp_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 sp_alchemical_toolbelt_desc: "True to its name, this project is less one of theory and more one of application. Alchemical packs are a fairly common accessory for trained alchemists already, but for soldiers and untrained conscripts in particular it’s much more challenging to create a toolbelt of regularly used concoctions and ingredients. Beyond its use we must also consider its safety as glass beakers that you might see in a more scientific setting tend not to enjoy the roughshod nature of combat. We’ll have to draw up some new hardy and chemically unreactive containers."
 tech_magical_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 zebra_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"

 sp_starmetal: "Synthetical Starmetal Alloy"
 sp_starmetal_desc: "It seems that our scientists are becoming more and more confident that they can synthetically reproduce starmetal. The alloy - so named for its presence in meteorites and coveted for both its strength and rarity - was long thought to be impossible to create in a worldly environment for many years, but this appears to have been a false assumption. Thanks in no small part to recent thaumaturgical advancements, it is theorised that we may be able to reproduce the vacuous conditions of space that could enable the production of starmetal on an unprecedented scale."
 tech_magical_starmetal: "Starmetal"

 ### Hippogriff Projects ###

 sp_underwater_rail_infrastructure: "Underwater Rail Infrastructure"
 sp_underwater_rail_infrastructure_desc: "Although Seaquestria is far from underdeveloped, the realities of sea floor construction have traditionally made the implementation of transport networks very challenging. The ability to move in three dimensions through the water has alleviated the strain this restriction would otherwise put on city infrastructure, but it is clear that some kind of mass transit will be needed in the near future. It has been theorised that large boring machines could be used to create and seal up new tunnels a safe depth under the sea floor, providing a relatively dry space in which to construct a rail network."

 ### Changeling Projects ###

 ### Kirin Projects ###

 sp_grand_astrological_orrery: "Grand Astrological Orrery"
 sp_grand_astrological_orrery_desc: "Astrology has long been employed by kirin to interpret the signs of the stars and the seasons, so it stands to reason that we would pursue the construction of a grand orrery with which to perform even more detailed predictions of the future. It will - of course - utilise the relevant and most up-to-date star charts, numerological and probability calculations in order to maximise the accuracy and utility of whatever answers we may find to our many burning questions."

 ### Changeling Projects ###

 sp_camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 sp_camo_cloak_desc: "Creating a substance that has the capacity to visually adapt to its surroundings will be no easy task, but it is a concept worth pursuing. We have always enjoyed the ability to change visually into most creatures and objects at will, yet our equipment does not enjoy the same kind of instant visual protection. Moreover, even talented changelings cannot mimic things beyond or below certain sizes. If our scientists could identify the biological magic that allows us to visually camouflage ourselves and isolate it, subsequently applying the same magic to cloaks and tarpaulins could radically alter the way we utilise stealth on a tactical level."
 tech_magical_camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 
 sp_temporary_chitin_structures: "Temporary Chitinous Structures" 
 sp_temporary_chitin_structures_desc: "Changeling hives are not alive, but have often been described as such due to how reactive they can be to changeling magic, with tunnels closing and opening at a drone's will. Much of this is due to the chitin and mucal material biologically produced and used by changelings to construct hives and maintain their function and integrity. A recent proposal suggested that we experiment on this material through thaumaturgical genetic modification, potentially allowing a few changelings to establish a small hive quickly. This structure can then be used as a temporary forward operating base until it begins to deteriorate after a few weeks. This could provide our soldiers with a home away from home and a local love repository that will improve their morale and fighting capabilities for a short time."
 tech_magical_temporary_chitin_structures: "Tactical Temporary Hive"

 ### Deer Projects

 sp_spirit_grenades: "Spirit Grenade"
 sp_spirit_grenades_desc: "One of our spiritually unfortunate scientists recently proposed this concept as a joke and it has since spiralled into a plausible idea. Using angry spirits as a tool of chaos against enemy formations is not a new strategy on its own, but using unicorn-inspired telekinetics to trap them inside grenade-sized containers certainly is. With such a device our forces could sow chaos anytime and anywhere, not to mention that being trapped in such a way would further infuriate the vengeful spirit contained within before they are set upon our enemies."
 tech_spirit_grenadiers: "Spirit Grenadiers"
 spirit_grenade: "Spirit Grenade"
 spirit_grenadier_company: "Spirit Grenadiers"

 sp_long_term_tactical_divination: "Long-Term Strategic Divination"
 sp_long_term_tactical_divination_desc: "Whilst seers have historically afforded our soldiers a significant amount of tactical insight, the nature of their visions prevents them from generating useful information at a meaningful rate and at convenient times. Instead it has been theorised that we can apply their visions to a grander strategy, collecting as many seers as possible in one place and collating the information provided in order to formulate a pinpoint plan for the future. It has been suggested that we could introduce a variety of stimuli to experiment with speeding up the process, but for now at least we shall be satisfied by developing a proper system of collective visionary documentation."
 tech_long_term_tactical_divination: "All Tomorrow's Battleplans"
 sp_long_term_tactical_divination_tp: "Every new commander will also receive this bonus."

 ### Diamond Dog Projects

 sp_tunnel_drill: "Assault Tunnel Vehicle"
 sp_tunnel_drill_desc: "Although tank-mounted dozer blades have proven effective, it has become clear to us that these are not wholly effective in mountainous regions where our forces regularly operate. Not wanting to resign armoured fortification and fire support to combat only in flat terrain, engineers have presented a prototype that our scientists are now pouring over. The blueprinted ‘Assault Tunnel Vehicle’ aims to clean up the engineers’ haphazard work for field testing, alongside a number of safety improvements and the introduction of a semi-crystaline engine to reduce exhaust buildup when tunnelling."
 tech_magical_tunnel_drill: "Tunnel Drill"
 tunnel_drill: "Tunnel Drill"
 tunnel_drill_company: "Tunnel Drill Company"

 sp_deep_rock_drill: "Deep Rock Drill"
 sp_deep_rock_drill_desc: "There is nothing fundamentally unique about the so-called ‘Deep Rock Drill’ in concept. Using a colossal mining platform to extra resources on a large scale is unusual, but not unheard of. What makes the DRD special is its energy source and its ability to extract almost any resource no matter the location. Advances in magical engines have allowed our scientists to begin developing an almost exhaustless power pack that also has the capacity to sustain thaumaturgical gyroscopes which will stabilise the drill when in operation."
 sp_deep_rock_drill_tp: "Unlocks £decision_icon_small §Cdecisions§! to establish §YDrill Site§! in owned states. You can then select what §gresource§! to excavate for; the resource type can be changed with a decision at anytime.\n\nIf the state transfers ownership to a non-diamond dog race country, then the §YDrill Site§! will be §Rremoved.§!"
 sp_deep_rock_drill_category: "Deep Rock Drill"
 sp_deep_rock_drill_category_desc: "Now that we’ve constructed this monument to thaumaturgical infrastructure, the question of what we do with it remains. In theory the DRD is capable of excavating and extracting any of the most common resources we may need, although it will take some time to retool the surrounding infrastructure to accommodate this magitech monster. There is no doubt that the machine will see heavy use in the years to come.\n\nIf the state transfers ownership to a non-diamond dog race country, then the §YDrill Site§! will be §Rremoved.§!"

 sp_news.1.t: "The Universal Translator"
 sp_news.1.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]With the advent of magitech in military and civilian life, it was only a matter of time before something truly groundbreaking was invented. The Universal Translator - as it has been named - is a complex arrangement of magitech and so-called ‘enchanted strings’ inside a radio headset that allows audio input to be translated near-instantaneously into the native tongue of the listener. Griffons from all over have already expressed interest in the system and the companies responsible for its creation have enjoyed a meteoric rise in stock prices."
