# Civil War Focuses

CES_cw_1_1:0 "Daring Do and the Jungle of Disharmony"
CES_cw_1_1_desc:0 ""Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am. I still don't know what possessed me to jump up and be the hero I portray in my books. Maybe I always was and never realized it. Either way, this will definitely be my most high-stakes adventure yet.""
CES_cw_2_1:0 "Find What Weapons We Can"
CES_cw_2_1_desc:0 "This little corner of Equestria was never particularly known for its industrial capacity. Thankfully, we've managed to locate a few unattended weapons caches that seem to have been intended for Nightmare Moon's forces. We're sure that she won't mind if we borrow them."
CES_cw_2_2:0 "Request Help from the Locals"
CES_cw_2_2_desc:0 "The reality is that we are never going to defeat these crazed Lunarists if we do not have everypony united behind our backs. Daring Do has already rallied many to our cause, but we must ask for more, or we will have no hope of restoring Harmony to the southeast."
CES_cw_3_0:0 "Convert Fishing Barges"
CES_cw_3_0_desc:0 "Stableside was nowhere near the largest port in Equestria, but it did have some traffic. We're fortunate that a few fishing barges were around at the time that we were cut off from Equestria, and we're even more fortunate that their captains want to help us take back the seas."
CES_cw_3_1:0 "Prepare the Lowlands"
CES_cw_3_1_desc:0 "A direct assault into the depths of the jungles remains a difficult task. Perhaps too difficult, if our frontline reports are accurate. But what if we didn't have do all of the fighting inside of those jungles? East of Galloprey lays an open field ripe with possibilities. One such possibility is a makeshift air field, from which we can work towards taking the fight to the skies."
CES_cw_3_2:0 "The Second Bastion of Harmony"
CES_cw_3_2_desc:0 "Stableside must be the light in this darkness. But an unshaped, unguided light does not offer direction to those who need it. Daring Do may be the glue holding us together, but no one mare is capable of running a war by herself. Our Commander needs help, and that is why we must put aside our differences and fall in line so that she may guide us to victory."
CES_cw_3_3:0 "Inspire the Scared and Hopeful"
CES_cw_3_3_desc:0 ""This isn't a story anymore. We are not just fighting for our lives, but for the hopes and dreams of everypony here! We may be cut off from Equestria, but the spirit of Harmony lives within each and every one of us! We cannot fail! We must not fail! WE WILL NOT FAIL! For if we do, then Harmony itself might be lost forever.""
CES_cw_3_10:0 "Refurbish the Relics"
CES_cw_3_10_desc:0 "Of the many museums Daring Do has contributed to, only one exists in this region of Equestria. Fortunately, the Stableside Museum of Equestrian History contains a veritable abundance of weaponry. Unfortunately, they are antique weaponry. Fortunately, they have never seen use. Unfortunately, they will probably fall to pieces in the jungle. We will take what we can get, though."
CES_cw_4_0:0 "Repurpose Stableside's Ports"
CES_cw_4_0_desc:0 "The ports of Stableside are nothing if not well-used. Converting them for the war effort would be both quick and easy, though we must remember to return them to their original purpose once we have succeeded in bringing peace to this land."
CES_cw_4_1:0 "Recruit the Fisherponies"
CES_cw_4_1_desc:0 "The famed fisherponies of Stableside have been mastering the sea for generations. While it pains us to ask them to stop and aid in something they are unfamiliar with, perhaps in the future we can reform them into proper seafaring soldiers."
CES_cw_4_2:0 "The Daring Fighter Squadron"
CES_cw_4_2_desc:0 "The time is now! With the Commander's blessing, our first fighters can now take flight. The sky belongs to those who live in the light of Celestia's sun, while those who subvert harmony in the shadows below are destined to be defeated!"
CES_cw_4_3:0 "Modify the Toy Factories"
CES_cw_4_3_desc:0 "Foals' ameneties are often one of the first things to be deprioritized during wartime. With great regret, we must turn their toy factories into arms factories in hopes that one day they may grow up not needing to work in those same factories."
CES_cw_4_4:0 "The Daring Infantry Regiments"
CES_cw_4_4_desc:0 "When the call came out to fight against the enemies of Harmony, few answered at first. But like a bursting dam, a huge wave of volunteers have arrived from all over to fight for Celestia, with their own weapons to boot. Now foward march and show them what we're made of!"
CES_cw_4_10:0 "Portland Center of Naval Operations"
CES_cw_4_10_desc:0 "One advantage we seem to have over our enemies is the capacity for prolonged naval logistics. Commander Daring Do has proposed that we prepare supplies in Portland to construct additional ports along the coastline so that we may easily supply our troops after taking their territory."
CES_cw_4_10_unlock_port_decision:0 "Completing this focus will grant us a decision to construct a §YNaval Base§! on the coastline of §YChinamitl§! to supply our troops if we control enough territory around there."
CES_cw_5_1:0 "Nationalize the Shipwrights"
CES_cw_5_1_desc:0 "While there are not many shipwrights within Stableside, there exists one who has the capability to churn out vessels faster than almost any other. Fortunately, the ponies running it have already agreed to help us, now it's just a matter of making their cooperation official."
CES_cw_5_2:0 "Do All That We Can And More"
CES_cw_5_2_desc:0 "Though we have given our all, our all is not enough! There can be no victory without sacrifice, and we must be willing to sacrifice every comfort of life if it means that future generations get to live in an Equestria where they don't have to sacrifice anything."
CES_cw_5_4:0 "Fix Up The Workshops"
CES_cw_5_4_desc:0 "Far too long have our arms factories been working with outdated red tape and procedures restricting the full capabilities of production. With the opening of our newest addition to war effort, we can remove these restrictions."
CES_cw_5_5:0 "Fear Not The Night"
CES_cw_5_5_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon's disciples stretch far throughout this land, but not all thestrals support her. There are those who would reject the Nightmare, not out of hate for her, but out of love for who she used to be."
CES_cw_6_1:0 "The Daring Marine Regiment"
CES_cw_6_1_desc:0 "As promised, the fisherponies are being returned to their area of expertise, ableit with lots of training and a new purpose in mind: to seize important coastal areas from those who would see Harmony thrown aside."
CES_cw_6_2:0 "Adapt To The Jungle"
CES_cw_6_2_desc:0 "The jungles surrounding Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan are treacherous and miserable to fight in. While we are loathe to use the tactics of our enemies, we must accept that we need to learn from them if we are to defeat them in their very home."
CES_cw_6_3:0 "The Art of Survival" 
CES_cw_6_3_desc:0 "Daring Do's experiences in rigorous terrains have given her an immense insight into how to survive in these areas. Together with her compatriots and associates, she will put together a manual with tips and tricks to help our troops fight in the wilds."
CES_cw_6_4:0 "Make A Little Go A Long Way"
CES_cw_6_4_desc:0 "This has been a weary conflict, but Commander Daring Do has transformed a once-scared group of ponies into a valiant fighting force. Before we would hoard resources in hopes that the war would end quickly, but now we see that this was not the way. We have to spread our resources as far as they will go in order to succeed."
CES_cw_6_5:0 "Our Reasons, Our Purposes"
CES_cw_6_5_desc:0 "Commander Daring Do is nothing if not a determined mare. Her defiant speeches seem to convey the same energy depicted in the very books bearing her name, if not more so. Even then, occasionally we must remind ourselves of what exactly we're fighting for."
CES_cw_6_6:0 "Seize the Nightmare's Tools of War"
CES_cw_6_6_desc:0 "As the war rages on, we've uncovered more and more supplies stored away by those who seemed to have been preparing for Nightmare Moon's return, as if they knew it was going to happen. While that remains a mystery for later, these supplies can be put to good use fighting against those whom they were intended for."
CES_cw_7_4:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
CES_cw_7_4_desc:0 ""For Harmony! For Equestria!" is the battle cry spearheaded by our Commander. For months we've been singing her praises, but she downplays when others call her a hero, preferring to redirect those praises back to us. For heroes are the ones that fight against the darkness. And heroes never lose."

### Civil War events #####

daring.1.t:0 "From Book Hero To Real Hero"
daring.1.desc:0 "Things had happened so quickly.\n\nA.K. Yearling was doing book signings in Stableside when the news broke out. Nightmare Moon had returned? A civil war had begun? In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial Resistance was born."
daring.1.a:0 "They never did question what happened to A.K. Yearling, though."

daring.2.t:0 "Improvising A War"
daring.2.desc:0 ""What are your orders, Commander?"\n\nDaring Do could have sworn that she'd heard that question more times in the past few weeks than there were words in all of her books combined. She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""
daring.2.a:0 "What she wouldn't give to return to smaller scale adventures..."

daring.3.t:0 "The Night Is Almost Over"
daring.3.desc:0 "The news of Nightmare Moon's disciples beginning to break formation and flee from our soldiers arrived late last night. It was fitting, all things considered, that the last of the Lunarist forces laid down their weapons and surrendered at the break of dawn.\n\nWhile they have shown us nothing but hatred in recent times, we must be better than them. We are Equestrians, and so are they, even if they don't see it that way. Provided that our former enemies do not betray our kindness, they will be treated the same way that everypony should be: as a friend."
daring.3.a:0 "To fight for Harmony, we must be willing to show mercy."

daring.4.t:0 "Helping Hooves"
daring.4.desc:0 "It was not every day that a "fictional" adventurer who writes books about herself under a secret identity ends up leading an army of ragtag freedom fighters against fanatical Nightmare Moon cultists, bloodthirsty mercenaries, and worst of all, socialists. Not to mention that a certain loudmouth kept following her into active war zones just to complain about how the "original trilogy's Daring Do" would have handled things differently. Quibble Pants was his name, right?\n\n"...and on page 137 of Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone, it CLEARLY STATES that quote: 'Daring Do would never intentionally place herself or others in danger!' Furthermore..." On and on he went, ranting about the tiniest details.\n\n"Everypony's a critic..." She muttered under her breath. Fortunately, help arrived in the form of two ponies that recently assisted her in organizing her forces. The former was a young, neatly dressed stallion by the name of Good Word, the latter a... generously sized, middle-aged stallion adorned with dress-like attire traditionally worn by the natives of the Equestrian Southeast. Chief Maita, she recalled.\n\n"Ah, Commander Do! It is good that you are here!" exclaimed Chief Maita, paying no heed to the odd earth pony rambling on behind her. He approached Daring Do and scooped her up in an enormous embrace that caught her off guard, "I have gathered all members of my tribe as requested! And several neighboring ones as well! They will join the fight under your banner."\n\nDaring struggled to breathe. "Good... to see... you too... Stop hugging!"\n\nAs Chief Maita released her, Good Word trotted up to her with an enthusiastic smile. "Greetings Commander Daring. You will be pleased to know that you have the full support of the Friendship Lodge, as well as a non-insignificant number of ponies in the towns where we have established Lodges. Your message of fighting for harmony is being spread far and wide... well, as far and wide as it can reasonably go without long-distance communication."\n\nThis was progressing better than she anticipated. "Thank you both. Please ensure that any new recruits get at least some basic training before they're sent to fight. And it's just Daring Do." She nodded, then excused herself to try to escape Quibble's unending criticisms.\n\nGood Word and Chief Maita exchanged glances. "She is commanding us though, isn't she?" Both shrugged."

daring.7.t:0 "A Surprise, to be Sure"
daring.7.desc:0 "The second-to-last thing that Daring Do had expected when she awoke was to find a sizable army of Lunarists just outside of her frontline outpost. The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the relatively young thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, former First Officer of the New Lunar Empire. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon. So that's what we're going to do.""
daring.7.a:0 "But a very, very welcome one."

daring.8.t:0 "What We're Fighting For"
daring.8.desc:0 "It was unusual that Daring Do managed to find time to sit down and speak with her general staff nowadays, though today was an exceptionally rare occurrence in that all of her most helpful advisors were together in one place. This presented an opportunity that she couldn't afford to pass up. She summoned Good Word, Chief Maita, and Crescent Glow into her tent.\n\nThe four of them shuffled in, three of whom were wondering what the matter was. "What are you all fighting for?" Daring began, "I want to know your personal reasons, all of you."\n\nWithout hesitation, Good Word spoke up first. "I believe that Celestia will protect us so long as we have faith in Her. She has watched over us for as long as Equestria has existed, and She will continue to do so as long as we follow Her teachings and strive to be like Her most faithful student. For these reasons, I fight in Her name." His overly enthusiastic praise of Celestia garnered some raised eyebrows, but no one commented on it.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, Crescent Glow took a deep breath and said, "You've already heard my reasons, Commander, but... I think I have another reason now. Before she became Nightmare Moon again, Princess Luna spoke highly of her sister and the Elements of Harmony. Of how they once helped her in her darkest hour. It's my hope that we'll be able to bring them all together again so that they can return her to normal, hopefully for good. That is what I'm fighting for."\n\nChief Maita nodded at the thestral's insightful comment. As all eyes laid on him, he simply shrugged. "War is too noisy, too bloody. That means I must keep the foals at home. I fight so that the foals may safely play outside without disturbing my sleep."\n\nDaring stifled a chuckle, then picked up a pen. "These reasons and more are why we will win. Do you all mind if I put your words into propaganda?" Her advisors shook their heads, "Great! Once we secure control of the Southeast, we can reestablish contact with Equestria to help Celestia, help Luna, and most importantly, get some well-needed rest!""
daring.8.a:0 "Diverse our exact reasons may be, but Harmony must be fought for."

daring.9.t:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
daring.9.desc:0 "What was once a makeshift headquarters had rapidly grown into an organized war machine over the past few months. A few ponies putting together supplies was now a full logistics network; a few dozen partisans listening to Daring Do's requests were now a legion of freshly-trained soldiers awaiting their Commander's orders.\n\nRaising her megaphone, Daring addressed the troops standing before her. "When we began this fight, we were just a disorganized group of scared ponies," She paused, looking out at all of the ponies who had volunteered for her cause, "But now we're much more than that! I don't see disorganized partisans, I see a full rebellion against disharmony! I don't see scared ponies, I see determined crusaders! I don't see Nightmare Moon's subjects, I see Equestrians!"\n\nThe crowd stomped their hooves and cheered as Daring Do briefly lowered her megaphone. She was surprised at how motivational speeches came naturally to her. A lot of time spent writing captivating phrases in her books seemed to help out in this regard. Maybe she really was cut out for this whole "heroic figure" thing. That thought caused her eyes to light up and her megaphone to be raised again. "There's a word for ponies who fight for a good cause against a superior foe. The moment we decided to not accept disharmony, we became that which we tell our foals about at night: Heroes. And you know we also tell them? That HEROES NEVER LOSE!""
daring.9.a:0 "The resounding thunder of applause drowned out any doubt about their mission."

CES_solar_category_desc:0 "Faith in Celestia is the foundation of the Friendship Lodge. Her authority is absolute, and to go against Her is tantamount to heresy.\n\nOf all of Her servants, Good Word is perhaps the most devout. It was he who saw that Her transformation was not a fall from grace akin to Nightmare Moon's, but instead a fiery rebirth into true divinity. Like our Goddess, Good Word has undergone a similar spiritual metamorphosis. He is no longer the same stallion that he was before. He is more. He is faith personified. He is the Righteous Hoof of the Sun, and his interpretation of the Goddess' will shall be made truth.\n\nGood Word is feeling [Root.GetGoodWordEmotion]."
