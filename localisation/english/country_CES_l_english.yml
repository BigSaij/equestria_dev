 # Civil War Focuses
 
 CES_cw_1_1:0 "Daring Do and the Jungle of Disharmony"
 CES_cw_1_1_desc:0 ""Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am. I still don't know what possessed me to jump up and be the hero I portray in my books. Maybe I always was and never realized it. Either way, this will definitely be my most high-stakes adventure yet.""
 CES_cw_2_1:0 "Find What Weapons We Can"
 CES_cw_2_1_desc:0 "This little corner of Equestria was never particularly known for its industrial capacity. Thankfully, we've managed to locate a few unattended weapons caches that seem to have been intended for Nightmare Moon's forces. We're sure that she won't mind if we borrow them."
 CES_cw_2_2:0 "Request Help from the Locals"
 CES_cw_2_2_desc:0 "The reality is that we are never going to defeat these crazed Lunarists if we do not have everypony united behind our backs. Daring Do has already rallied many to our cause, but we must ask for more, or we will have no hope of restoring Harmony to the southeast."
 CES_cw_3_0:0 "Convert Fishing Barges"
 CES_cw_3_0_desc:0 "Stableside was nowhere near the largest port in Equestria, but it did have some traffic. We're fortunate that a few fishing barges were around at the time that we were cut off from Equestria, and we're even more fortunate that their captains want to help us take back the seas."
 CES_cw_3_1:0 "Prepare the Lowlands"
 CES_cw_3_1_desc:0 "A direct assault into the depths of the jungles remains a difficult task. Perhaps too difficult, if our frontline reports are accurate. But what if we didn't have do all of the fighting inside of those jungles? East of Gallopfrey lays an open field ripe with possibilities. One such possibility is a makeshift air field, from which we can work towards taking the fight to the skies."
 CES_cw_3_2:0 "The Second Bastion of Harmony"
 CES_cw_3_2_desc:0 "Stableside must be the light in this darkness. But an unshaped, unguided light does not offer direction to those who need it. Daring Do may be the glue holding us together, but no one mare is capable of running a war by herself. Our Commander needs help, and that is why we must put aside our differences and fall in line so that she may guide us to victory."
 CES_cw_3_3:0 "Inspire the Scared and Hopeful"
 CES_cw_3_3_desc:0 ""This isn't a story anymore. We are not just fighting for our lives, but for the hopes and dreams of everypony here! We may be cut off from Equestria, but the spirit of Harmony lives within each and every one of us! We cannot fail! We must not fail! WE WILL NOT FAIL! For if we do, then Harmony itself might be lost forever.""
 CES_cw_3_10:0 "Refurbish the Relics"
 CES_cw_3_10_desc:0 "Of the many museums Daring Do has contributed to, only one exists in this region of Equestria. Fortunately, the Stableside Museum of Exotic History contains a veritable abundance of weaponry. Unfortunately, they are antique weaponry. Fortunately, they have never seen use. Unfortunately, they will probably fall to pieces in the jungle. We will take what we can get, though."
 CES_cw_4_0:0 "Repurpose Stableside's Ports"
 CES_cw_4_0_desc:0 "The ports of Stableside are nothing if not well-used. Converting them for the war effort would be both quick and easy, though we must remember to return them to their original purpose once we have succeeded in bringing peace to this land."
 CES_cw_4_1:0 "Recruit the Fisherponies"
 CES_cw_4_1_desc:0 "The famed fisherponies of Stableside have been mastering the sea for generations. While it pains us to ask them to stop and aid in something they are unfamiliar with, perhaps in the future we can reform them into proper seafaring soldiers."
 CES_cw_4_2:0 "The Daring Fighter Squadron"
 CES_cw_4_2_desc:0 "The time is now! With the Commander's blessing, our first fighters can now take flight. The sky belongs to those who live in the light of Celestia's sun, while those who subvert harmony in the shadows below are destined to be defeated!"
 CES_cw_4_3:0 "Modify the Toy Factories"
 CES_cw_4_3_desc:0 "Foals' amenities are often one of the first things to be deprioritized during wartime. With great regret, we must turn their toy factories into arms factories in hopes that one day they may grow up not needing to work in those same factories."
 CES_cw_4_4:0 "The Daring Infantry Regiments"
 CES_cw_4_4_desc:0 "When the call came out to fight against the enemies of Harmony, few answered at first. But like a bursting dam, a huge wave of volunteers have arrived from all over to fight for Celestia, with their own weapons to boot. Now forward march and show them what we're made of!"
 CES_cw_4_10:0 "Portland Center of Naval Operations"
 CES_cw_4_10_desc:0 "One advantage we seem to have over our enemies is the capacity for prolonged naval logistics. Commander Daring Do has proposed that we prepare supplies in Portland to construct additional ports along the coastline so that we may easily supply our troops after taking their territory."
 CES_cw_4_10_unlock_port_decision:0 "Completing this focus will grant us a decision to construct a §YNaval Base§! on the coastline of §YChinamitl§! to supply our troops if we control enough territory around there."
 CES_cw_5_1:0 "Nationalize the Shipwrights"
 CES_cw_5_1_desc:0 "While there are not many shipwrights within Stableside, there exists one who has the capability to churn out vessels faster than almost any other. Fortunately, the ponies running it have already agreed to help us, now it's just a matter of making their cooperation official."
 CES_cw_5_2:0 "Do All That We Can And More"
 CES_cw_5_2_desc:0 "Though we have given our all, our all is not enough! There can be no victory without sacrifice, and we must be willing to sacrifice every comfort of life if it means that future generations get to live in an Equestria where they don't have to sacrifice anything."
 CES_cw_5_4:0 "Fix Up The Workshops"
 CES_cw_5_4_desc:0 "Far too long have our arms factories been working with outdated red tape and antique equipment restricting the full capabilities of production. With the opening of our newest addition to the war effort, we can focus on bringing the rest of our factories up to code."
 CES_cw_5_5:0 "Fear Not The Night"
 CES_cw_5_5_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon's disciples stretch far throughout this land, but not all thestrals support her. There are those who would reject the Nightmare, not out of hate for her, but out of love for who she used to be."
 CES_cw_6_1:0 "The Daring Marine Regiment"
 CES_cw_6_1_desc:0 "As promised, the fisherponies are being returned to their area of expertise, albeit with lots of training and a new purpose in mind: to seize important coastal areas from those who would see Harmony thrown aside."
 CES_cw_6_2:0 "Adapt To The Jungle"
 CES_cw_6_2_desc:0 "The jungles surrounding Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan are treacherous and miserable to fight in. While we are loathe to use the tactics of our enemies, we must accept that we need to learn from them if we are to defeat them in their very home."
 CES_cw_6_3:0 "The Art of Survival" 
 CES_cw_6_3_desc:0 "Daring Do's experiences in rigorous terrains have given her an immense insight into how to survive in these areas. Together with her compatriots and associates, she will put together a manual with tips and tricks to help our troops fight in the wilds."
 CES_cw_6_4:0 "Make A Little Go A Long Way"
 CES_cw_6_4_desc:0 "This has been a weary conflict, but Commander Daring Do has transformed a once-scared group of ponies into a valiant fighting force. Before we would hoard resources in hopes that the war would end quickly, but now we see that this was not the way. We have to spread our resources as far as they will go in order to succeed."
 CES_cw_6_5:0 "Our Reasons, Our Purposes"
 CES_cw_6_5_desc:0 "Commander Daring Do is nothing if not a determined mare. Her defiant speeches seem to convey the same energy depicted in the very books bearing her name, if not more so. Even then, occasionally we must remind ourselves of what exactly we're fighting for."
 CES_cw_6_6:0 "Seize the Nightmare's Tools of War"
 CES_cw_6_6_desc:0 "As the war rages on, we've uncovered more and more supplies stored away by those who seemed to have been preparing for Nightmare Moon's return, as if they knew it was going to happen. While that remains a mystery for later, these supplies can be put to good use fighting against those whom they were intended for."
 CES_cw_7_4:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
 CES_cw_7_4_desc:0 ""For Harmony! For Equestria!" is the battle cry spearheaded by our Commander. For months we've been singing her praises, but she downplays when others call her a hero, preferring to redirect those praises back to us. For heroes are the ones that fight against the darkness. And heroes never lose."
 
 # Post-war tree
 
 #intro
 CES_pw_intro_1:0 "Stabilize Stableside"
 CES_pw_intro_1_desc:0 "We may have won the civil war, but now we're faced with the challenge of actually governing the Southeast. To that end, Daring Do has begun creating the framework for a real government, one that can handle all of the "boring politics" ahead. One mare simply can't run everything by herself."
 CES_pw_intro_2:0 "Political Perplexion"
 CES_pw_intro_2_desc:0 "Politicians, like nearly everypony, require a workplace to do their job. We should expand Stableside's city hall however we can to make room for a real government."
 CES_pw_intro_3:0 "Puzzling Parties"
 CES_pw_intro_3_desc:0 "Though most paperwork and legislation will be done after the government has been set up, some of it needs our immediate attention. In fact, "some" may be an understatement."
 CES_pw_intro_4:0 "Look Upon Equestria"
 CES_pw_intro_4_desc:0 "Now that we have organized our fledgling government, the time has come to finish reestablishing contact with the rest of the continent. The only question is, what has happened to Equestria while we were busy restoring harmony to the Southeast?"

 CES_army_3_3:0 "Fighting Amidst the Heat and Trees"
 CES_army_3_3_desc:0 "The civil war was a logistical nightmare. Trucks of supplies would arrive late, if at all. Anything paradropped would get tangled and swallowed by the forests.

 CES_army_4_1_desc:0 "Among the many important lessons we learned from this war — irregular warfare is a paramount idea we cannot leave unexplored.

 CES_navy_5_1:0 "Our Own Cruisers"
 CES_navy_5_1_desc:0 "With our forays into light ships a glaring gap between our larger and lighter projects has revealed itself.

 CES_air_2_1:0 "Import Surplus Fighters"
 CES_air_2_1_desc:0 "Despite their effectiveness, the fighters we had during the war were not limitless. We've only got a shell of the former number we had when the DFS was established, and even then they're of limited use in dogfights given their lack of maintenance. To bolster our forces we should purchase older models of foreign fighters."
 CES_air_2_2:0 "Import Outdated Bombers"
 CES_air_2_2_desc:0 "As nice as it would be to procure a fleet of modern bombers, our situation does not allow us to afford such an expense at the minute.

 CES_air_3_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Saltmane"
 CES_air_3_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings, a Baltimare firm focused on the design of twin engine bombers, have offered up a fleet of naval bombers which were to be shipped to Equestria shortly before the civil war began.\n\nSince they've been sitting in stockpile we'd be able to get them for a small fee to complement our air force."
 CES_air_4_1:0 "Standardize SEAF Training"

 CES_air_5_1:0 "The Vanilla Mosquito"
 CES_air_5_1_desc:0 "After the success of the Vanilla Comet, Vanilla Clouds has come up with a new design for a CAS role. Designed to bomb light targets while the Comet focuses on distracting enemy fighters, it should ensure our troops are able to punch far above their own weight."
 CES_air_5_2:0 "Night Fighter Squadrons"
 CES_air_5_2_desc:0 "There exists a type of fighting mostly ignored by other countries, that of using the night as you would any other weapon in your arsenal.

 CES_industry_7_2:0 "Modernise Our Production Methods"

In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial Resistance was born."

She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""

We are Equestrians, and so are they, even if they don't see it that way. Provided that our former enemies do not betray our kindness, they will be treated the same way that everypony should be: as a friend."

Quibble Pants was his name, right?\n\n"...and on page 137 of Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone, it CLEARLY STATES that quote: 'Daring Do would never intentionally place herself or others in danger!' Furthermore..." On and on he went, ranting about the tiniest details.\n\n"Everypony's a critic..." She muttered under her breath. Fortunately, help arrived in the form of two ponies that recently assisted her in organizing her forces. The former was a young, neatly dressed stallion by the name of Good Word, the latter a... generously sized, middle-aged stallion adorned with dress-like attire traditionally worn by the natives of the Equestrian Southeast. Chief Maita, she recalled.\n\n"Ah, Commander Do! It is good that you are here!" exclaimed Chief Maita, paying no heed to the odd earth pony rambling on behind her. He approached Daring Do and scooped her up in an enormous embrace that caught her off guard, "I have gathered all members of my tribe as requested! And several neighboring ones as well! They will join the fight under your banner."\n\nDaring struggled to breathe. "Good... to see... you too... Stop hugging!"\n\nAs Chief Maita released her, Good Word trotted up to her with an enthusiastic smile. "Greetings Commander Daring. You will be pleased to know that the Friendship Lodge is working tirelessly to organize volunteers for the cause. Your message of fighting for harmony is being spread far and wide... well, as far and wide as it can reasonably go without long-distance communication."\n\nThis was progressing better than she anticipated. "Thank you both. Please ensure that any new recruits get at least some basic training before they're sent to fight. And it's just Daring Do." She nodded, then excused herself to try to escape Quibble's unending criticisms.\n\nGood Word and Chief Maita exchanged glances. "She is commanding us though, isn't she?" Both shrugged."

She had her reservations when the plans were made, but seeing ponies determinedly train even with the limited equipment they had been given was enough to assuage them. Even now dozens of ponies flitted through the air, performed basic drills, and trained at the firing range.\n\nWandering across the courtyard, Daring couldn't help but start listening to the overlapping conversations around her from the raw recruits. Those brave souls who stood for harmony talked of home and of hope. She smiled, before hearing some wondering where their friends who'd signed up before them had gone.\n\nDaring picked up the pace.\n\nHer thoughts were thrown aside as she heard a deafening crack from the firing range, followed by a string of expletives. Moving towards the range, Daring could see a mare struggling with an anti-tank rifle almost as large as she was. "Oh come on! I just got this stupid thing fixed..."\n\nTrotting over, Daring noticed the look in the mare's eyes. As they readied another shot, Daring decocked the rifle, causing the mare to look up at her in surprise. "This thing's been seeing far more action in the past few months than it's seen in years, I'm not surprised it's being grouchy." Daring said as she patted the weapon.\n\n"I can understand that but it's just-" The mare sighed, "I'm going to be relying on it soon enough, and I can't afford it breaking when I need it. If it does then..."\n\nThe unspoken statement hung in the air for a moment as Daring softened her gaze. "I've found throughout the years that the least reliable tool will always end up working when the moment is critical. All it takes is the courage to trust it to the end."\n\nThe mare gulped and looked at the rifle. "What if I don"t have that courage?" Daring smiled."

The refreshing scent of the ocean filled the air as Daring's gaze settled on a dock where a damaged destroyer was being tended to.\n\nThe ship was worked on by a strangely efficient team composed of pegasi and the occasional griffon, while a tall, blue unicorn mare was passing up materials and giving orders. Getting closer, she noted just how focused the unicorn was on her team. She'd even made it directly behind the mare without her even taking her eyes off the materials she was passing up.\n\nEventually, she spoke up. "Seems like ha-" Her unexpected voice startled the mare, causing her to lose control of the metal sheet she was passing up. In a split second Daring dived forward, tackling the mare to get both of them out of the way.\n\nAs the dust settled, the mare winced and opened her eyes. "Ow... Why'd you—Wait, C-Commander Daring?" She blinked in recognition, shakily standing and extending a hoof to the commander. "I-I'm Azure Bliss, the 'new' captain of this ship. To what do I owe the pleasure?"\n\nDaring took the hoof and steadily stood back up, brushing herself off as she did so. "I needed some fresh air after a stuffy meeting. Anyways, what's going on with this ship? I thought the scheduled maintenance ended a month ago?"\n\nAzure rubbed the back of her neck guiltily. "Well, the last patrol did a number to the front of the ship and the l-last captain. We brought the ship back for repairs, but after looking at the damage I figured that maybe a bit more armor wouldn't hurt much, a-and-"\n\nDaring examined the additions. It wasn't perfect, but considering they were made out of spare metal, haphazard welds and some hopes, it looked to be surprisingly sturdy. She couldn't really tell more than that, since her expertise in adventuring equipment didn't cover warships. She'd have to ask a naval officer, which the resistance was still sorely lacking.\n\nDaring's ears perked up as she observed the rambling mare. There weren't many options left for naval officers since any admiral worth their saltlick had either thrown their lot in with Baltimare or ran north to serve Celestia. They didn't need the perfect pony for the job, just somepony to hold the fort until the war was over or until a more qualified pony came along. Ultimately, she shrugged as a decision formed in her mind."

The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the relatively young thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, First Officer of the New Lunar Empire's southeastern theatre. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon.

This presented an opportunity that she couldn't afford to pass up. She summoned Good Word, Chief Maita, and Crescent Glow into her tent.\n\nThe four of them shuffled in, three of whom were wondering what the matter was. "What are you all fighting for?" Daring began, "I want to know your personal reasons, all of you."\n\nWithout hesitation, Good Word spoke up first. "I believe that Celestia will protect us so long as we have faith in her. She has watched over us for as long as Equestria has existed, and she will continue to do so as long as we follow her teachings and strive to be like her most faithful student. For these reasons, I fight in her name." His overly enthusiastic praise of Celestia garnered some raised eyebrows, but no one commented on it.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, Crescent Glow took a deep breath and said, "You've already heard my reasons, Commander, but... I think I have another reason now. Before she became Nightmare Moon again, Princess Luna spoke highly of her sister and the Elements of Harmony. Of how they once helped her in her darkest hour. It's my hope that we'll be able to bring them all together again so that they can return her to normal, hopefully for good. That is what I'm fighting for."\n\nChief Maita nodded at the thestral's insightful comment. As all eyes laid on him, he simply shrugged. "War is too noisy, too bloody. That means I must keep the foals at home. I fight so that the foals may safely play outside without disturbing my sleep."\n\nDaring stifled a chuckle, then picked up a pen. "These reasons and more are why we will win. Do you all mind if I put your words into propaganda?" Her advisors shook their heads, "Great!

"When we began this fight, we were just a disorganized group of scared ponies," She paused, looking out at all of the ponies who had volunteered for her cause, "But now we're much more than that! I don't see disorganized partisans, I see a full rebellion against disharmony! I don't see scared ponies, I see determined crusaders! I don't see Nightmare Moon's subjects, I see Equestrians!"\n\nThe crowd stomped their hooves and cheered as Daring Do briefly lowered her megaphone. She was surprised at how motivational speeches came naturally to her. A lot of time spent writing captivating phrases in her books seemed to help out in this regard. Maybe she really was cut out for this whole "heroic figure" thing. That thought caused her eyes to light up and her megaphone to be raised again.

Despite the... objectionable beliefs of the ponies in Baltimare, they seemed to have nailed the idea of governing quite well. And so, Daring Do had proclaimed that a republic would be established, complete with a parliament and elections for a president once the new capitol building was finished. The unique role of "Commander" would still retain full control of the military, but only Daring would ever hold the title.\n\nWhat Daring neglected to mention, however, was that she planned to step down once everything was set up so she could go back to adventuring and writing books.

It was here that two of the Commander's advisors found themselves setting up desks and furniture when one of them broke the silence, "Why do some other thestrals call you a 'Celestian?'"\n\nThe question, though innocent in nature, seemed to pierce the humble earth pony. Good Word's ever-cheerful demeanor seemed to falter momentarily. "I believe it is a derogatory term used for ponies who are as... enthusiastic about Celestia as myself. You grew up in Ayacachtli, didn't you? I figured you would know."\n\nCrescent Glow nodded, turning to help her companion move a table. "Well, I was kind of sheltered growing up. I was never allowed to leave the caves as a filly," She chuckled nervously, "The first time I met ponies from the other tribes was when my parents let me go to Canterlot University."\n\n"I've always wanted to see Canterlot," Good Word sighed as they hefted the table to the other side of the room, "As for Ayacachtli, just last year, I foolishly tried to preach the lessons of Celestia and her faithful student to the Moonspeaker Conclave. They seemed to humor me, but I quickly found myself removed from the city before I could explore further. I am curious, though: Is it true that there's a giant statue of Princess Luna in the central region of the cavern?"\n\n"Yeah. I actually got to see her back when I graduated. I'll never forget it... and..." Crescent stopped. Her breathing became shaky.\n\nGood Word noticed the thestral's crumbling expression and trotted over to her. "You miss her, don't you?" Crescent nodded, trying to hide her sniffling. Good Word offered her a comforting hoof, "Hey, don't cry. Maybe there's a way we can bring her back. The Elements of Harmony did it before."\n\nCrescent gently brushed aside his hoof, "I also got to see Celestia, too. I'm not sure how, but I could tell that she had suffered while Luna was gone. I then realized that the Sun and the Moon must live together in harmony. One isn't more important than the other."\n\nThe earth pony raised an eyebrow, "I know that my preference for Celestia is obvious, but I don't discount that Luna is also important.

Just as the closing remarks were given, a disheveled stallion rushed on stage. He was holding a small device that hadn't graced Stableside since the civil war began — a ham radio. He exclaimed that he had traveled a long way in order to obtain it; he returned home as fast as he could once he confirmed that it could pick up transmissions from Canterlot.\n\nThis caused quite a stir within the room, as nopony really knew what was truly going on in the rest of the continent.

The official reason is due to the strain of administering to the rest of the country due to the chaos the civil war had brought, and as a reward for restoring harmony to the Southeast without the Princess' help.\n\nThe only condition to our semi-independent existence is that the Princess has stated in no uncertain terms that we are to help Equestria defend herself from any and all threats to harmony."

While as Commander she had full authority in all military matters, today's elections were a civilian matter, and she had been granted the honor of initiating the first general elections. In addition, she had an important announcement; she hoped it would be taken well.\n\nShe tapped on the microphone and cleared her throat, "To say that we've accomplished a lot in recent times is an understatement. Just a few short years ago this city wasn't much more than a tourist's fourth destination, and now Stableside is probably the most notable city in the Equestrian Southeast, even more so than Baltimare. Our freedom from tyranny wouldn't be possible without the brave stallions and mares of our armed forces."\n\nDaring paused for effect, "This brings me to my next point. Since the beginning, I have led our troops against the forces of disharmony. While I have enjoyed my time with all of you, I can tell that our humble republic has a bright future... a future where I am not needed. And so, as soon as our elections conclude and a president has been determined, I will be resigning from my post as Commander until such a time comes that I am needed again. I do not make this decision lightly, but I must be honest with you all: I need a break. I haven't had a full night's rest since the civil war began. Just know that I fully trust our best and brightest to lead our armies in my absence. Thank you all for supporting me, and I wish you the best. Now, let's see who the ponies of the [Root.GetName] want to lead them!"\n\nA veritable uproar encompassed the entire room as the elections began in earnest. Daring Do's speech was transmitted across the entire southeast, and ponies everywhere flocked to their nearest ballot to cast their vote for their preferred candidate."

While we succeeded in restoring harmony to this corner of Equus, the worst has befallen the rest of Equestria! Dark clouds are hanging over the continent, and soon they may come our way. That is why we must prepare ourselves to fight those who have been brainwashed by tyrants and disharmony. To that end, we will try to establish ourselves internationally as the true successor of Equestria so that we can get the help we need to reunite our war-torn nation. The first step to that will be electing a president to run the daily matters of our fledgling republic while I focus on leading the troops in our inevitable confrontation with [3.OWNER.GetLeader] and beyond if need be."\n\nHolding back a tired sigh, she forced a smile to ease everypony's minds from the coming conflict.

Daring Do was supposed to officiate the ceremony, but with her sudden departure, the big opening speech was instead given by one of her military officers. They spoke about how much we had accomplished in such a short time, and about how Equestria, or the Solar Empire as it was now called, had given the Southeast a chance to prove themselves as "worthy" in these tumultuous times.\n\nFurthermore, while a few officials from the Solar Empire have arrived to help make the transition into joining the Empire progress smoothly, they have assured us that we are more than welcome to govern ourselves until such a time that the "Empress" decides to directly administrate the entirety of her territories again.\n\nThe speech was concluded with an earnest wish that the Commander would come to her senses and return soon for the challenges that we would no doubt face ahead."

 daring_harmony.3.desc_harmony:0 ""So, how are you liking your new office?" Daring Do asked as she leaned against the door, "And your new position?"\n\nStanding across the room from Daring was the earth pony that had played a significant role in helping keep the civilian populace calm during the recent conflict. "It's certainly fancier than my office in the Lodge Headquarters," Good Word delicately touched the padded chair, the mahogany desk, and many of the other fancy decorations within the newly-furnished presidential office. "...I don't suppose I could redecorate a bit? While I do appreciate having a nice place to work, I'd prefer that we spend our funds on helping those in need rather than ensuring that I feel comfy."\n\n"Always the humble one. Yeah, you're free to do whatever you want with this place." Daring trotted over to Good Word, then spotted some construction workers putting the finishing touches on the courtyard through the window. She motioned for him to watch with her. The ponies outside seemed to be laughing with each other as they worked.\n\n"So," Daring broke the short silence, "What made you want to run for president?"\n\n"Well..." Good Word's usual smile vanished as he looked up towards the clouds that were obscuring the sun, "There's a lot of ponies in Equestria who are suffering right now. Countless more are struggling just to make it to the next day. Not to mention how many will lose their lives before all of this is truly over." He turned to Daring and looked her in the eyes, "I want to help restore Equestria to what it once was. To prove to others that Celestia's love for her little ponies isn't gone. To show them that, in the end, there is a light in the darkness."\n\nDaring whistled, "Poetic. But there's one thing that concerns me." Good Word raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Daring continued, "Your 'community', the Friendship Lodge. They're not gonna like, force their beliefs upon other ponies, are they?"\n\nHe vehemently shook his head, "No. We're a ponytarian organization, nothing more. We help those in need, but we also want them to know how important Celestia's lessons are, as well as those of Twilight Sparkle and her friends."\n\n"I see." Daring felt somewhat reassured, though she had an inkling that there was more to Good Word that she had yet to see. "In any case, I think you'll be a great president.""

"It's certainly fancier than my office in the Lodge Headquarters," Good Word delicately touched the padded chair, the mahogany desk, and many of the other fancy decorations within the newly-furnished presidential office. "...but I don't think that I deserve this much." His eyes were cast down; a distinct gloominess emanated from him.\n\n"Always the humble one. You can redecorate if you want." Daring trotted over to Good Word and put a hoof on his back. "How are you holding up?"\n\nHe was silent for a moment, then he turned to look out the window, up to the clouds that were obscuring the sun. "There's a lot of ponies in Equestria who are suffering right now. Countless more are struggling just to make it to the next day. Not to mention how many will lose their lives before all of this is truly over." He turned back to Daring and looked her in the eyes, "I... I wanted to help teach others how much Celestia loved them. But... but I... I can't..." He seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n\nDaring Do was many things, but a counselor she was not. She bit her tongue, weighing how to best approach him. "Well... just because Celestia's not around anymore doesn't mean that her lessons have lost their importance."\n\n"Everypony in the Lodge thinks they have. We may be a ponytarian organization, but we really did love Celestia. I loved Celestia. And... she's gone. Just like that, the symbol of harmony is no more." His eyes became wet. "How can I go on when the light in the darkness has been replaced by a ruthless tyrant?"\n\n"Hey, you're one of the strongest ponies I know. You can do this, even if you think you can't." Daring glanced over to his copy of Twilight's Journal of Friendship on the table. "I seem to recall a lesson that you had said to me when we first met: 'You don't have to take on these tasks alone. You will have your friends by your side.'" She wrapped a hoof around him in encouragement, "You better remember that! We'll be here for you, no matter what!"\n\nFor the first time since he'd heard the news of what had happened to Celestia, he smiled. "Thanks. I'll do my best to keep the spirit of harmony with me.""

He sighed as he examined the padded chair, the mahogany desk, and many of the other fancy decorations that outclassed the humble decor he kept back in the Lodge Headquarters.\n\nGood Word had just gotten back from his speech after being sworn in as president. He recalled how unusual the atmosphere was, as many of the ponies who were present seemed to be more interested in hearing about how they could help the "Solar Empire" defeat her enemies rather than listening to what he had to say. His attempted segway into reaffirming the principles of friendship and harmony was even interrupted by one of the representatives that "Daybreaker" had sent in order to "assist" with their transition into becoming a "puppet state" of the "Empress."\n\nA puppet. Was that really what they were now? Good Word glanced at the portrait of Celestia hung on the wall. She was always so kind and forgiving, but the news that he kept hearing about her recent actions seemed wholly out of character for the Princess. Stories of ruthless behavior towards her sister's followers, harsh punishments for dissenters, and overly protective laws that restricted her ponies' freedom? It was too much to believe, yet the facts were in the fine print of every newspaper.\n\n"What should I do?" He asked the silent portrait. He had always thought of Celestia as the most perfect pony to ever live. It simply wasn't possible for her to become so... twisted. Surely her recent changes were just because of stress, right?\n\nCelestia's smiling portrait seemed to loom over him.\n\nI have to lead these ponies, he thought. If Celestia's most faithful student could overcome any challenge, then I shall follow in Twilight's hoofsteps - I will become Celestia's most devoted disciple.\n\nGood Word averted his eyes from the portrait, down to his copy of Twilight's Journal of Friendship on his desk. His heart burned as he recalled the lessons within that were now a stark contrast to Celestia's recent actions. He buried his head in his hooves."

She fidgeted in her chair as she tried to settle into the newly-furnished presidential office.\n\nDaring tilted her head. "Hey, don't beat yourself up too much.

"Now that I'm here, I don't even know where to start."\n\n"You may not realize it, but you're smarter than you think." Daring glanced at the portraits of Celestia and Luna on the wall. "The road ahead won't be easy, but nopony is expecting you to be perfect. Even the princesses aren't perfect. Just remember that you have your friends here to help you." She turned to open the door, "I know you'll be a great president. If you ever need me, I'll always make time for you."\n\n"Thanks. I really mean it." Crescent sat back in her chair as she finally began to absorb the reality of her new position. Technically she was still a senior military officer, but being president meant that she had a lot of new responsibilities to uphold. She thought about what Daring had said, then retrieved a pen and parchment. If there was one thing she wanted to accomplish more than anything, it was to fully remove the deeply-rooted stain of Nightmare Moon's influence from thestralkind.\n\nAnd so she pondered on how best to separate the worship of Nightmare Moon from the worship of Princess Luna."

 daring_harmony.4.desc_solar:0 "Crescent sat silently in the newly-furnished presidential office as she glared at the paperwork in front of her. The bills and other documents she was supposed to sign filled her with dread every time she read over them. One would make large, unsanctioned gatherings illegal. Another would encourage reporting suspicious individuals to the authorities. A third would criminalize "disharmonious actions", subject to the interpretation of law enforcement. All of these things seemed minor, but she could tell that it would quickly become a slippery slope until harmony itself was twisted beyond recognition.\n\nMost surprising of all, though, was the fact that she was president at all. The Solar Empire did not interfere in or contest the Southeast's decision to elect a Lunarist to lead them. Crescent recalled the recent visits she had received from imperial dignitaries, and how dismissive or outright repulsed they seemed to be by her beliefs. Celestia and her ponies had become warped, self-righteous imitations of who they used to be, and Crescent could tell that their influence would inevitably seep into the Southeast given enough time.\n\nShe thought back to Daring Do's outburst when parliament had decided to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia. She sincerely thought that the Commander would be able to convince them that they were about to abandon harmony, but it seemed that she didn't know her fellow ponies nearly as well as she thought she did.\n\nCrescent opened her desk drawer to retrieve the portrait of Luna that she had hidden in there. How kind and fair the princess of the moon was... it made it all the more heartbreaking that she was all but forgotten for Nightmare Moon.\n\nThe thestral's eyes widened as she had an idea. There was a way, just maybe, for her to preserve Luna's legacy before the poisonous beliefs of the Solar Empire spread enough to make it impossible. She fetched a pen and parchment and began to draft a motion on how best to separate the worship of Nightmare Moon from the worship of Princess Luna."

Daring Do's outburst when parliament had decided to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia resulted in the Commander disappearing without a trace. Several emissaries from the Solar Empire were now present to assist with the Southeast's transition into becoming a puppet state of the Empress. The peaceful future that the chief had looked forward to so much now seemed further away than ever.\n\nHe observed an imperial dignitary scolding a construction worker for some minor error. Harmony seemed to become more and more twisted with each passing day...\n\nEven now, several of the tribes that he had represented seemed to recognize his authority less and less as they adopted the practices of Daybreaker's followers. Maita knew that he was never the most active of leaders, but even with the powers invested in him by the public, there was very little he could do to stop the poisonous beliefs of the Solar Empire from seeping into the Southeast until its unique culture was completely gone.\n\nHe missed having Daring Do around.

"Peace," his voice strained, a touch of pain echoing through his words. Good Word noted an amputated wing.\n\nThe unicorn went next, her eyes averted. "For the Princess," she murmured so quietly that everypony had to lean forward to hear her.\n\nNext, the bat pony, a purple sheen complementing her dark fur. She looked at Good Word with eyes that battled between rage and kindness. "To prove a point," she spoke firmly.\n\nLastly, the earth pony. Behind his glasses held shifting, anxious eyes. "T-t-to help o-others," he stuttered out.\n\nSo different, Good Word thought. He couldn't help but smile. "I see. Well, there's nothing wrong with having your own reasons, but if you wish to be a part of the lodge, there is one thing you must do: Live for others as Princess Celestia does. We are like an appendage, extending her grace to the ponies of the Southeast. It doesn't matter where you come from or who you are, anypony can do this. And in each of you I sense that desire, even behind pain, adoration, anger, or fear. Despite what you believe to be your flaws, I see a chance to channel strength and love for your fellow ponies." By the end of the speech, each pony had their entire focus on Good Word, their eyes softened as their spirits subsided. Even the bat pony, whose chest contained a rage of an unknown, yet predictable origin, had tears in her eyes.\n\nGood Word smiled, then passed a set of forms to the four.

 daring_harmony.8.desc_harmony:0 "Crescent Glow dropped her pen and gazed at the proposition she had written under the desk lamp's light. Countless words lined the page, highlighting the key differences between the Lunarists and Nightmareists. Tomorrow, she would bring this before her citizens in hopes that ignorance would no longer remain prevalent in the Equestrian Southeast. At least in government writing, she and her followers would be separate from Nightmare Moon's terror, and Chiropterrans would be alienated from the Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe pony spun her chair to the side and gazed out the window. Not a single living creature walked through the streets, and the buildings along the road emanated pure darkness from their windows. Crescent Glow raised the window, letting in the sound of the buzzing street lights and the subtle symphony of crickets. She momentarily closed her eyes and felt the embrace of the night breeze, then tilted her neck up and looked up. A full moon accompanied by a sea of stars floated before her, illuminating the sleeping city below.\n\nCrescent looked at an dimly lit picture of the former princess on her desk. "Why did you do it, my Princess?" she asked, "Why did you allow the Nightmare to take over?"\n\nShe felt tears well up in her eyes as she grit her teeth. She put her hooves together and closed her eyes. "Please come back, Princess Luna. Please, please, please," she begged, hoping her Princess would hear her words. She squeezed her hooves harder and harder until the point the appendages touched became numb. Her eyelids clamped even tighter. Her prayer, even louder.\n\nBut time passed, and no miracle occurred. Crescent opened her eyelids and looked at her hooves as they regained color. Would Luna even hear her words? Was she even conscious within the Nightmare?\n\nThe mare sighed and wiped her eyes. Though she no longer had her Princess, at least Celestia was still here. She was warm and kind, even if she didn't represent the bat ponies. Crescent chuckled as she felt a little jealous towards Good Word.\n\n"Enough of that, Crescent. You're better than that," she muttered to herself. "Who knows, perhaps Luna is still in there, somewhere." She closed her window and grabbed the paper off of her desk. Crescent looked up once more at the night sky before turning off her lamp."

 daring_harmony.8.desc_resistance:0 "Crescent Glow slashed another sentence, gritting her teeth. This was supposed to be simple. Just paperwork. Just another series of questions to ask and answer, and just some edge-cases to find and address. Just. Paperwork. She only had to highlight the differences between Lunarists and Nightmareists. The two were as different as the night was from the day, so why was this so bloody difficult? She owed it to herself, owed it to her followers, to separate them from Nightmare Moon's terror... at least in government writing.\n\nShe touched her quill to the paper, but when the tip broke off, a sob escaped her as she slumped over her desk. Would anyone else believe what she wrote? What reason did ponies even have to stop treating all bat ponies like Nightmareists?\n\nBiting back her tears, Crescent spun around her chair to gaze out the window, if only to clear her head. The streets were desolate, and every single building dark. She looked up, and when her eyes fell upon the night sky, she could almost pretend like things were still normal. The moon shone bright amidst a sea of stars, illuminating the dormant city below. Just like that, the tears she had so adamantly fought returned.\n\n"Why did you do it, my Princess?" she asked, turning her gaze to the dimly lit picture of Luna on her desk. "Why did you allow the Nightmare to take over?" She grit her teeth and wiped her tears, before putting her hooves together and closing her eyes. "Please come back, Princess Luna. Please, please, please," she begged, hoping her Princess would hear her words. She pressed her hooves harder and harder until the point where they touched grew numb. She squeezed her eyes shut and screamed the prayer in her mind.\n\nBut time passed, and no miracle came. Crescent opened her eyelids and watched her hooves as they regained color. Could Luna even hear her words? Could she still be conscious within the Nightmare?\n\nSighing, Crescent wiped her eyes again and steeled her resolve. She couldn't let despair get the better of her. Though she was alone now, that might not always remain the case, and though hope was meek with Luna and Celestia gone, she had to keep it alive.\n\nCrescent pulled out a new quill. She had paperwork to finish."

She managed to etch out a few words this time, but like all of her other attempts to write a second proposal to protect Luna's legacy as well as her friends and family, she just could not put together the magical set of words that would change the minds of the ponies in parliament.\n\n"The president's motion to separate the concepts of 'Lunarism' from 'Nightmareism' has been denied." The words from the speaker rung over and over in her head as she replayed today's events. Not only had they rejected her proposal, they even accused her of putting her own ponies before the "safety of the public at large." It had taken every ounce of mental fortitude for her to not shout obscenities at the speaker for such a brazen statement. The only consolation was that they had accepted her proposed pardons for some former supporters of Nightmare Moon.\n\nThe impossibility of it all loomed in front of the young president. "I can't do this." She croaked as she dropped her pen. She was well and truly alone in her goal, and the ponies who had the power to help her achieve it had no interest in doing so. Those that did had all resigned because they did not want to support a government that submitted itself to Daybreaker. Even Good Word had left, and that stung the most. She recalled begging him to stay, but the stallion was too heartbroken by Celestia's transformation to function in a government setting.\n\nThe moonlight loomed through the window. Crescent grit her teeth. When did life become so difficult?! It seemed like just yesterday that she and her friends were fighting for harmony, but harmony itself was about to change into something twisted! And there wasn't a single thing she could do to stop it!\n\nShe couldn't take this anymore. She crumpled up and threw the paper into the trash along with the dozen other ideas she had discarded. She toppled her desk to the floor, grabbed the coat rack, then threw it across the room at the smiling portrait of Celestia on the wall. She turned and looked at the moon, then screamed into the night about the unfairness of it all.\n\nLater, when the night security guards came into Crescent's office to investigate the noises, they saw naught but a wrecked room and an open window."

 daring_harmony.13.desc_harmony:0 "Prior to the war, almost all development in the Equestrian Southeast was funded from the occasional glance of Canterlot and the will of its industrialists. Some local development had sprung up here and there, but they've mostly been in a losing battle with the more prominent companies in the north. The civil war had shifted the table significantly: with most companies busy focusing on supporting one side or the other, their assets needed to be seized and split between smaller homegrown companies and the state to avoid economic collapse.\n\nWith relative peace had returned to the Equestrian Southeast, the time had come to choose how to rebuild it. We'd managed to scrape together a fair starting amount of funds, but now the Republican Congress had found itself at a crossroads in how to use it. Most points were easily agreed upon, such as improved infrastructure and the building of dams in several key rivers. Though in retrospect, such ideas were merely a way of skirting around the main issue which was now staring Tiger Eyes in the face.\n\n"With all due respect, Mister Speaker. I can not in good faith support the proposals made by the opposition." Misty Mane, a pegasus from Baltimare, barked, "His proposal will generate nothing but scraps and resentment! Nopony should be forced to slave away beneath our beautiful land; it is better that we focus on developing our industries."\n\nMisty Mane sat back down, amidst a polite wave of "Hear, hear." from her party members. Tiger silenced them with a wave of his hoof, then gestured for a pony on the opposing side of congress to present. Bit Dust, a small, grey unicorn from Portland, stood up.\n\n"I understand your concerns, though I feel you may have exaggerated the dangers of such a plan," Bit said, shrugging, "Quite simply, I do not believe we're ready for developing our own heavy industry yet. Instead, we should focus on our natural resources. By exporting them to any friendly face, either up north or across the Celestial Sea, we can use our allies' industry to develop our own at an even greater pace!"\n\nBit sat back down amidst another wave of "Hear, hear." Tiger Eyes sighed as he looked back towards Misty Mane, seeing a snarl curl up on her face. If he didn't call them all to vote now, they'd just go at each others' throats for eternity..."

 daring_harmony.13.desc_resistance:0 "After a set of worrying messages from Canterlot, we've found that most of our previous options for funding now lay in the hooves of despots. Naturally, this has limited our options for the necessary development of our new nation. What assets we could seize from the companies that pulled out of the Southeast are not anywhere near enough for the reconstruction efforts. Every house we rebuild scrapes closer to the bottom of our treasury and every repaired factory brings risks both by foreign saboteurs and by our lack of proper tooling.\n\nThe Republican Congress, by Daring Do's order, has been tasked with finding a way to invest our remaining funds. Most ideas were easily agreed upon — improving inter-city infrastructure, the building of dams in several key rivers and other similar measures. Though, in the end, such matters were simply diversions from the glaring issue which was now rearing its ugly head before Tiger Eyes.\n\n"Mister Speaker, I cannot reasonably support the proposals made by the opposition." Misty Mane, a pegasus from Baltimare barked. "His ideas won't achieve anywhere near what we need! If we place all our bets on exporting our resources, then we'll have nothing left when [3.OWNER.GetNameDef] comes knocking! We must instead focus on developing our industries, otherwise what we've fought so hard for will mean nothing in the end!"\n\nMisty Mane sat back down, amidst a strong wave of "Hear, hear." from her party members. Tiger silenced them by tapping his hoof on the table, and gestured for a pony on the opposing side of the congress to present. Bit Dust, a small grey unicorn from Portland, stood up.\n\n"Another dragon or the egg debate, Miss Mane? Surely you must understand the plans we propose will ensure far better results," Bit stated, sighing, "Our economy is simply not ready for us to smash through with heavy-hooved industrial plans. If we want to survive your floundering ideas and to be ready for whatever may come, then I insist that we focus on exploiting our natural resources to the fullest extent. A large factory count is lovely on paper, but if they're making guns out of scrap then they'll amount to nothing."\n\nBit calmly sat back down amidst a louder wave of "Hear, hear."

He counted himself lucky that his position as speaker of the house was still needed even despite that recent restructuring of the government.\n\nThroughout the hall, informal discussion of faith and economics dominated the gathering. Most of the conversations Tiger could ignore, at least until they came up in official proposals. The snippets he could hear were... overly friendly chatter? There were only a scarce few ponies that he recognized now; nearly all present wore clothing representative of their membership in the Friendship Lodge.\n\nIt certainly wasn't the atmosphere Tiger was used to from the congress, but he couldn't say he hated it. He watched as a senator, Misty Mane, enthusiastically debated industrial plans with a prominent Lodge member, Young Bridge. The debate was a far cry from the shouting matches Misty's debates usually became, with Misty's boisterous claims being calmly considered by the slow, yet enjoyable additions from the "Senior Lodger" as he called himself.\n\nAfter a few moments of ponywatching, Tiger signalled for the day's debates and proposals to officially begin. The portraits stared as plans and proposals were discussed and approved. Most matters were easily agreed upon, such as improving jungle infrastructure and making use of the valuable rivers, but soon came the point which had caused so many heated discussions in the congress: Where to focus?\n\nDespite his worries, the calm atmosphere from earlier still hung tightly to the congress. As Misty Mane came up to present her plans, Tiger didn't expect a shouting match over where to focus their efforts, as had happened so many times before. She gave a passionate speech about industry and the port cities which would provide the most benefits if granted funding, and waited with baited breath for the expected retorts.\n\nTo her utter shock, none came.

If you feel my worries are exaggerated, then surely you can prove it, right?"\n\nShe was met with a chuckle as Bit's horn lit up, lighting a nearby lantern and bringing it before her. "Of course. If you wished for a tour, then all you needed to do was ask." He walked past her, leading her down through a more active tunnel. "You didn't need to fuss about safety inspections just to visit a friend after all."\n\nThey continued to chat as the tunnel wound on, eventually depositing them in a large chasm filled with working ponies. Earth ponies made up most of the team, working with pickaxes and mechanised tools. Unicorns moved the minerals and materials to minecarts pulled by more earth ponies. A small team of bored pegasi were on duty, making sure everypony was safe from the drop and wearing proper equipment.\n\nBit turned to his cautious companion, watching as she took it all in.

After a moment in silence, he nudged her. "Chin up, Miss Mane. You see those ponies, just across the street?" Misty looked up, spotting a familiarly ragged family. The youngest carefully hobbling along with a copy of the Revised Friendship Journal. She turned to Young, meeting his warm gaze. "D'they seem familiar?"\n\n"Y-yeah, that's Chip Block and his family...they've been on the streets of Baltimare for years. Chip himself is one of my employees. Why do you ask?" Young nodded in the family's direction, prompting Misty to look back. The family were looking at an apartment building, and chattering happily as Chip pulled out a key. After a brief pause, they ascended the steps and headed inside. "Wait, Chip managed to find a place to live?"\n\nYoung looked back down at her and nodded. "Yes, thanks to you." At Misty's expression, he continued. "I met his youngest earlier today. Lovely foal, she was, talked my ear off about the work her father did and the praises he'd sung of your efforts."\n\nThere was silence for a moment. "Not every foal in Equestria will be kind, Miss Mist." Young continued, despite Misty's floundering shock. "Some pass judgment unto others, when they themselves need it more." He winked. "But many will treat their fellows fairly, and such treatment will be rewarded. Be it when an age has passed, or merely when they need it most."\n\nIt took a few moments for the smile to leave Misty's face.

Light Narrative asked as he sat down across from [CES.GetLeader], who simply nodded. "Well, your letter was quite the surprise, I must admit. First the pardon, and now a job offer?" Light chuckled. "Not everypony treats their former enemies this way, you know?"" But then, he arched a eye, almost theatrically so. "Only... why do you think I would accept? Why do you think I would join you, when I've fought against the status quo before?"\n\n[CES.GetLeader] gave him a polite smile. "I could list off a few points, but I think you and I both know you have your reasons."\n\nLight Narrative opened his mouth, but [CES.GetLeader] was right; Light had come here fully expecting to accept the offer. His people had too much to gain from it for him to refuse. Not only would his public appearances as a military officer do wonders for the population's view of thestrals, but having thestrals follow him into [CES.GetNameDef]'s army would greatly soothe stereotypes and other prejudice. Ten or twenty years from now, ponies would tell their families, "Actually, I served with a few thestrals." What more could he ask for?\n\nLight Narrative sighed. There was no point playing games, was there?"

 daring_harmony.16.desc_resistance:0 "Light Narrative smacked his lips again before checking the letter on his table for the tenth time this morning, hoping to find a vague hint in the wording to sway his decision one way or the other. Yet again, the letter proved unhelpful.\n\nHe sighed. Daring Do wanted him to fight alongside her, even though they'd once fought each other. He and many other thestrals who had fought for Nightmare Moon had since been pardoned, but that meant little in the grand scheme of things. Then again, it made sense from her point of view. She was still fighting, and she could use the help of an experienced general, as well as that of the ponies he brought with him, even if it meant recruiting a former enemy.\n\nFor him, the choice was much harder, because accepting would always feel like he was renouncing his old ideals. He still believed in harmony, but above all, he wanted the best for his people. Winning alongside Daring Do would only mean things going back to how they had been.\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe ponies would learn from their mistakes, and finally accept thestrals as the fourth tribe? The Celestial Resistance certainly had, had it not?\n\nLight Narrative let out another sigh. And maybe it was time he faced it; even if Daring's victory were to mark a return to the status quo, her loss would undoubtedly entail worse. And besides, he'd never really liked Nightmare Moon to begin with."

But he'd been summoned, and he had every right to be here. He gulped, knocked on the door, and was soon invited in.\n\nAs Light Narrative entered the room, he found Good Word sitting at his desk, putting away papers. Taking only a brief moment to look at Light, he pointed to the seat across his desk. Light Narrative sat down, and before Good Word could speak up, he cleared his throat. "So, what is it you want?"\n\n"Was I unclear in my letter? I would like you to join Her army."\n\nLight Narrative scoffed. "Oh please, as if you'd accept a thestral into the great Daybreaker's army." He put as much venom as he dared into these words. "We both know it was just a ploy to draw me out, and I only accepted because I knew you would stop at nothing to get to me." What else would a Celestial zealot who'd even accepted to follow Daybreaker want with a thestral?\n\nGood Word put together his hooves as he looked Light Narrative in the eye. "No, Light, the offer is genuine." Light Narrative expected to see some disdain or even malice in his eyes, but, if anything, found only sympathy. "In fact, I was also considering inviting you to the Friendship Lodge."\n\n"But why?" No other words came to Light Narrative as sat there, mouth ajar, eyes wide, and brow furrowed.\n\n"We, the Friendship Lodge, oppose the purging of those who have not yet had a chance to accept Celestia's light into their hearts, and instead wish to grant them a genuine opportunity to walk the righteous path." He nodded towards Light Narrative. "A part of that is helping subdue those who reject Her truth."\n\nLight Narrative fell silent. Celestia's light, huh? Accepting that would mean renouncing everything he'd fought for before, wouldn't it? But then again... maybe not. Many thestrals, including himself, had taken a gamble with Nightmare Moon, but had never actually liked her. Fighting alongside Daybreaker's forces would at least get them into her good graces, and it would save them from a fate far worse.\n\n"If you need more time to think about my personal offer of joining the Lodge, feel free to get back to me later. However, I would like your answer on the subject of your new job today, ideally," Good Word said.\n\nLight Narrative sighed. This was for the best, wasn't it?"

 daring_harmony.17.desc_harmony:0 "Jungle Trek was bored.\n\nIt had been a reoccuring issue as of late. Usually boredom was a very rare instance in the life of a mercenary, but ever since the fall of Aztlan he hadn't exactly been doing much of that either. The loss stung particularly hard for him; despite knowing the jungles like the back of his hoof, it hadn't changed a thing. He had been forced to surrender along with the rest of his band, guilty of treason against Equestria.\n\nAt least it hadn't been the communists or the Lunarists that had won, though. Jungle and many others were surprised to find themselves still free ponies when it was all said and done, likely as a result of their former employer switching sides and negotiating on their behalf. Many had fled, taking up new jobs overseas at the first opportunity, but not Jungle. He and a few others had stuck around, with nowhere else to go. Not that there was much to do at home, though, considering that not many were hiring for illiterate mercenaries.\n\nOr at least, that was what he had thought. An old friend of his had stopped by a few days ago and told him about an offer the government was making. They wanted him — all of them back, to serve in their new army. He would even get a position as an officer, just like back in Aztlan.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, sure. Jungle was positive that there would be plenty of boring staff meetings, irritating superiors, and a smaller bit count. He'd be part of a real army, serving a real nation instead of himself. It would be the end of his mercenary days for good.\n\nBut when all he had left was more of the same old boring days?\n\nHe'd gladly take the alternative."

 daring_harmony.17.desc_resistance:0 "Jungle Trek, as befitting his name, did not like the urban Equestrian cities very much. He far preferred the deep jungles, places away from civilization and modernity. Even places like Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan catered to him more than the artificial nature of Stableside and Baltimare.\n\nUnfortunately, Stableside was where he was needed, and thus it was where he would go.\n\nIt was a no-brainer when he got the offer from the government. A place back in the army as a general, with all the benefits it would bring? At the very least, it was certainly better than sitting around doing nothing as a self-proclaimed mercenary.\n\nIn reality, there were deeper motivations than just boredom, though. Jungle couldn't imagine Equestria, his real home, falling. It was like harmony itself was gone, clinging to life here in the forgotten jungles. Could he really still call himself an Equestrian if he didn't do something to help out? He still had a moral compass, after all.\n\nAnd plus, it was much better than the alternative. Jungle had already gotten pardoned once; he was fairly certain it wouldn't happen again.\n\nWith a deep breath, he walked into the looming administrative office, putting on the best aura of confidence he had left. "Hi," he said to the secretary, "I'm here about that position in the army I was offered a few days ago?""

Ponies were scared, and the worst part is that here, they were not sure what to be scared of.\n\nNothing had happened... yet. There had been no purge, no great cleansing in the name of the sun as some of Jungle's collegues had assumed. He was sure that he was still on a list somewhere; treason against Equestria is not forgotten so easily. But instead of being imprisoned or executed, the government was offering him a job. A position in the army, for a generous pay.\n\nWhy did they want him? Were they testing his loyalty? Would he have to order terrible crimes on their behalf? At first, he wanted to throw the offer away and push it out of his mind, but things were never that simple. If it was not him, it would just be somepony else who may not care as much as he did. At least if he took the offer, he could try to make a real difference where it mattered.\n\nAnd if they ever showed the darker side that everypony feared... well, Jungle Trek just hoped that it wouldn't come to that."

Once filled utterly with modest furnishings of a war room and remembrances of past adventures, it was now an empty husk dotted with boxes in various states of packing. She leaned further into the soft jungle wood of the table, letting her two front hoofs carry the brunt of her weight as her wings extended. They fanned out like a bird's tail, removing the stiffness built up. Hours of paperwork and delegation left her sore and spent. She'd long since grown tired of her duties, and while there were some parts of leading a nation that she enjoyed, she would not miss the bureaucracy that came with it.\n\nFinally, a chance to look at a map that isn't related to military engagements, she thought. She began to run her hoof along the map, tracing the lines and marks, each containing a precious memory, whether triumph or folly. She cherished them regardless. She began to roll the weathered parchment, cracking like butter scraped over too much bread.\n\nFrankly, Daring cared not for where she went, so long as she could leave this all behind. As much as she appreciated the respect and devotion of the ponies who served with her, she wanted to return to the days before it all, before the war—just another Daring Do adventure, maybe even one worthy of a book. As her excitement grew, she remembered that she had one last piece of official business to take care of. With stoicism, she shuffled through her bag.... pulling out a parchment, and with quill in hoof, she penned her last statement as Commander.

For Pages, it was unbelievable how down-to-earth the princess was, more so with her not just "poofing" every book to its proper place but doing it all normal, all with her.

Yet, he'd never done it, not when his position offered him so many opportunities to speak up on such a huge stage. Daring was one mare in a sea of ponies in need; it would've been difficult to ignore their plight just for petty gain. No grand gesture of rubbing it in save for that one time; she'd went on, left on her own terms.\n\nIt was a victory: for him, for Equestria, and for her. And though she won, the hatred and the need to curse her name had also been gone for a long time.\n\nBut when Daring disappeared into those museum doors, it felt like a missed opportunity. His missed opportunity..."

 daring_harmony.26.t:0 "The Righteous Truth of the Sun"
 daring_harmony.26.desc:0 ""With respect, princess... where exactly are we going?"\n\n"A room that very few ponies know about," Celestia answered cryptically, "but I think it would be the perfect place for us to speak."\n\nThe two of them walked for some time throughout the castle's corridors, passing many rooms and even entering a secret passage to a lower section of the castle. The air was stale and the decor contained dust and cobwebs, as if they were the first visitors to enter in a hundred years. Eventually, the two reached a single plain door at the end of a torchlit hall. Celestia levitated her crown in front of the door, causing both to glow slightly. Celestia opened the door, then motioned for Good Word to follow her inside.\n\nUpon entering the room, Good Word was profoundly confused. The place was full of scrolls and tomes, along with various symbols and artworks styled after Princess Celestia. "What is this place?"\n\nThe princess walked to one of the tomes and dusted it off. The cover seemed to depict her hovering in front of a sun while ponies burned around her. "This is a collection of all of the religions that have been formed in my name."\n\nGood Word immediately felt a bowling ball drop in his gut as he realized why she had brought him here. "I... I don't understand."\n\nIf she knew that he knew, then she didn't show it. "There is something that you must know. Over the millennium since my sister's initial banishment, many cult followings were established in my name." She began to point at several collections in succession, "This one belonged to the 'Solarium.' That one, the 'Order of Sunlight.' The 'Daystar Temple.' 'Celestia's Children.'" She paused for effect, "There are more, of course. You will notice that none of them exist in any history books. That is because I've taken measures to ensure that none ever gained any significant following."\n\nGood Word gulped as he tried to process all of this. "But we're not a religion."\n\nCelestia nodded, "I know. This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours, while not quite a religion, is very close to becoming one. In truth, had I known about it prior to Nightmare Moon's return, I would have had it dismantled. But it is too late now." She approached Good Word and put a hoof onto his shoulder, "You must not allow your organization to worship me. I will not have a repeat of the Chiropterran 'religion', but with me instead of Nightmare Moon.""

 daring_harmony.27.desc:0 ""With respect, princess... where exactly are we going?"\n\n"Someplace that I haven't been to in far too long," Celestia answered cryptically, "but I think would be very good for the both of us to visit it."\n\nThe two of them walked for some time throughout the castle's corridors, passing many rooms and even ascending one of the highest towers. Soon, they reached a lonely set of double doors where two of Celestia's royal guards stood at the ready. With a single nod from the princess, the guards stepped aside. Celestia seemed to hesitate when she reached the door. After a moment, she opened it and beckoned for Crescent to follow her inside. Upon stepping inside, Crescent's heart skipped a beat. She stood eyes wide with her mouth agape, "This is..."\n\n"Princess Luna's room," Celestia finished for her, "I... couldn't bring myself to come here. Not after I had failed her again."\n\nCrescent was silent as she absorbed her surroundings. This was... this was Luna's private chambers. Ornate decorations themed after aspects of the night were just about everywhere. A blanket on the bed with stars as numerous as the sky. Soft lights scattered the room, with a singular crescent shaped lamp hanging from the ceiling. A desk with a photo of the two princesses lay in the corner, illuminated by the moon through the skylight above.\n\n"I brought you here because I wanted to apologize to you, Crescent." Celestia began, earning a shocked expression from the thestral, "I... I wasn't there for my sister when she needed me most. Every hour of every day I am reminded of my failure, and the sorrow I feel will never go away." The princess turned away, ashamed of herself, "My sister tried everything she could to help her subjects see the real her. While the ponies of Equestria will never forget the rise of Nightmare Moon, because of your actions they will also never forget the Princess of the Night that they had lost. It is you who have kept the memory of the real Luna alive when we— when I failed to do so." A tear streamed down Celestia's face as she looked up towards the moon. "She would be so proud of you."\n\nCelestia's words broke Crescent. The tear-stricken thestral practically threw herself against Celestia. The princess let go of any pretense of regality and fully embraced her. The two sobbed quietly for some time as they reminisced of dreams long passed into memory."

He asked if he could enter her humble abode—a cosy, unassuming place, free from the treasure-hunting relics of yesteryears. "You don't even bother with your fake Yearling identity anymore.

Don't forget that I've read your tarnished propaganda!" Yet laughter echoed through the halls from the both of them, which devolved into swapping stories.\n\nAfter battling through a bout of hesitation, Caballeron coughed to fully capture her attention. "Say, Daring, it is close to lunchtime. What do you think of eating out? Together?"\n\n"Ha! Lunch? With you of all ponies? Oh, come on! You've gotta be kidding! You...

 daring_adventure.1.desc:0 "Daring Do struggled to stretch her wing as she studied the old records of long-gone explorers. This cramped basement the museum called a library had little room for its contents, much less a medium-sized pegasus like herself. The stench of old, dilapidated papers and leather covers nearly kept her from entering in the first place, a challenge not even the testiest of ruins had presented to her.\n\nBut what was Daring Do without a challenge to conquer? The adventurer nodded to herself under the flickering, yellow light above to inspire confidence, and pointed her nose back to the task at hoof.\n\nAh, here it is, she thought with an audible gasp. "In the jungles of Tenochtitlan, I witnessed a battle between two tribes," she read along, "And though the fight seemed matched, there came a time when a shaman from one tribe came out, and strapped around her neck was an ebony horn, skinny and hollowed out. Much like I, the other tribe seemed confused, but their fighting did not cease."\n\n"Then, the shaman blew into her horn, and almost immediately I felt fearful, as did the other tribe. More than that, the other tribe grew stronger. Their reflexes, faster. I am not fully sure where such a horn came from, but my research has brought me to believe that it is an object more ancient than even Equestria itself. My colleagues laughed at me, but having experienced it, I will continue to push my theory: That horn comes from the head of an Abada. An ancient precursor unicorn."\n\n"So, Tenochtitlan, you say?" Daring muttered with a smile as she glanced over to the map of Southeastern Equestria. She marked a circle on it and chuckled."
 daring_adventure.1.a:0 "Looks like adventure is calling."
 
 daring_adventure.2.t:0 "The Tenochtitlan Rendezvous"
 daring_adventure.2.desc:0 "Tenochtitlan hasn't changed a bit, with its scorching temperatures and charming locale, but that's just what Daring liked. A little bit of stability after all that mess, and now her and Chief Maita were busily running from one end of the city to the other in search of leads.\n\n"Daring Do, you are too good to me, inviting me on one of your exciting adventures," the effort Maita had to put into keeping up with the pegasus suggested otherwise, "but I am a very busy pony now. Many depend on my guidance, and I must return to Stableside as quickly as possible."\n\nGlancing at a yet another store that dealt in old and odd goods, Daring wondered if she was chasing an old pony tale instead of something concrete, before assuaging Maita that their distraction won't take too much of his time. Unfortunately for both of them, the shopkeeper had nothing of use to divulge, with both ponies exiting and taking a seat next to the road to catch their breaths.\n\n"Excuse me, youngsters," an old voice surprised Daring as she didn't notice anypony sneaking up on them, "but did I hear you correctly back there? You are looking for an Abada horn?" In a sudden move that seemed impossible for his rotund shape, Maita rose up to greet the newcomer in their native tongue, somehow perceiving shared heritage, before engaging in a short yet energetic discussion. Daring would have said something herself, but the Chief seemed to have everything under control.\n\nJust as she was about to slink back onto the ground, the two parted, and Maita turned with a jovial expression: "We have great luck today, Daring Do! That old pony is one of the Neighua, and he recalled a particularly frightening event decades ago. He saw a pony from Tonaltzintli blowing into an ebony horn, and the sound left him shaking for days! He was reassuring me that he was no coward, to end up so frightened..." Daring tuned out from the rest of the Chief's rambling as everything he said matched up with the old texts, and concluded that any lead was better than staying here for another day."

 daring_adventure.3.t:0 "Cold Reception"
 daring_adventure.3.desc:0 "The thrill of adventure was always about the unexpected, but what Daring encountered in Tonaltzintli left both her and Maita stumped. All the ponies simply... shunned them. This hit the Chief hard in particular. "Daring Do, I have crossed paths with many ponies, but not even thestrals were this cold to me. I must admit it is a very unwelcome feeling." He would try to comfort himself with a joke at his expense, but it rang hollow.\n\nIt didn't dissuade the legendary explorer too much, but even she had to admit that the abject refusal of most ponies to even speak with them started to grate on the nerves. Those who didn't shy away from them knew nothing as the event supposedly happened decades ago, and very few even heard of it to begin with. Seemingly defeated from this negativity, Maita suggested that they take a break at the local diner, and Daring could find little reason to say no.\n\nStuffing his face with a hay sandwich, Maita was back in his element. "Let us not despair so quickly, Daring Do! I am sure we'll find out what's going on after this excellent meal." Oh how wonderful that the Chief was already served his large order while Daring still waited on a milkshake. After a while of listening to positive encouragement interspersed with eating, the waiter finally showed up, profusely apologising and giving Daring her desired comfort.\n\nShe was about to lean back in her chair to enjoy, when her eyes caught a note folded under the cup. Looking around, everypony still seemed to avoid them, thus providing little clue to who left it there, and her hooves were quick to open it. "Maita, look." He was slow to lean over.\n\n"Daring Do,\nthis note comes from a friend. Ahuizotl was in this area recently and spread vicious lies about you and your companions. Do not treat them harshly for this. The prize that you seek is in the jungle north of the city. Follow the trail till the largest tree, then seek a large slab rising from the ground. Good luck.""

 daring_adventure.4.t:0 "Daring Do And The Horn Of The Abada"
 daring_adventure.4.desc:0 "Though their provisions were adequate, Daring had underestimated just how extensive this trail was, and they frequently bickered over what constituted "the largest tree". Furthermore, Maita was obviously unused for anything more than a brisk trot for an extensive period of time, and breaks were frequently had in this dense, humid foliage.\n\nIt was all worthwhile in the end for the unmistakeably massive timber towered over its inadequate relatives, and even Maita in his sweat soaked state had to (somehow) prop up on his hindlegs to see just how far up it went. From there, it was a simple matter to locate the "slab", a tombstone that was decisively out of place within the canopy and critters. Daring had her eyes on the prize, and was quick to approach it, digging in her satchel for the collapsible shovel. It seemed too easy, and would certainly not make for a quality novel, unless Ahuizotl decided to pounce on them in the next few moments.\n\nAlas, no such interruption came, but Maita would instead read the barely legible inscription: "'Woe be unto the soul who disturbs this grave, for they shall suffer a thousand stings'. That seems... ominous. Daring Do, are you really going to desecrate a rest—" Dismissing the words as an empty threat, Daring dug into the undisturbed soil with reckless abandon. For all his warnings, even the Chief got into the adventuring spirit and helped out with his own tool, eventually striking on a decayed coffin.\n\nThe rotting lid was quickly pushed aside, and the sight of old bones unnerved the seasoned explorers. "Maita, look!" In the pony's forelegs, a horn matching the descriptions, dark and hollow, rested with its unfortunate last owner... alongside seemingly empty jars. Close inspection revealed that the jars held wasps intended for grave robbers. Laughter was shared between the two as the artefact was secured, with Daring providing one last remark for the would-be trapmaker:"

Her departure was surprisingly smooth, as she had firmly established the procedures for how our new government was to be run. While we wish her the best, our top priority now is to hold new elections for our next president. The only difference now is that it this is not for our ragtag resistance movement, but for Equestria itself.\n\nFirst is our current sitting president: Good Word. He has proven himself a capable civilian leader, having implemented countless economic reforms and aid packages for those who have suffered in recent years. Both he and the Friendship Lodge have risen beyond their purported obsession with Celestia to show Equestria that, more than anything, they are dedicated to helping others.\n\nNext is a famous politician of the Fillydelphia Republic: Cirrus Cloud, the "Thunderous Tubthumper" herself. An Equestrian patriot at heart, she has rallied countless ponies from her home to fight for harmony, causing endless frustrations for Nightmare Moon and others who sought to exploit the common pony. She has proven herself to be a very capable leader, one that seeks to push Equestria into a prosperous future.\n\nOne of the more surprising candidates is Sunset Shimmer, a former pupil to Princess Celestia. While she did return to help fight for Equestria, she was devastated by the defeat of the stalwart titan of a nation much like everypony else was. During the wars, she worked mostly from within enemy territory, sowing discontent and planting the seeds of hope for liberation. Now she seeks to do good as a proper leader, rather than a guerilla fighter.\n\nLastly is the most unusual candidate of all: Quibble Pants. A self-proclaimed "advisor" to Daring Do, despite her never appointing him to any official position. While anypony would tell you that he is incredibly annoying to listen to, they would also begrudgingly admit that he is usually right... sometimes. He is very adamant that he would be perfect to succeed Daring Do, as he has stated that his qualifications include "multiple corrections of Daring's biggest mistakes" as well as authoring "thirty different fanfictions, only seventeen of which include me."\n\nThese new elections proved to be incredibly heated, but in the end, only one candidate emerged victorious..."

Rainbow Dash was quite in her element, and Twilight couldn't help but smile and nod along to this ceaseless gushing. It reminded her of simpler days when she recommended the series in the first place, back when everything seemed just right. And even though friendship and harmony were saved in the end, Twilight still harboured a great deal of self-doubt, wondering if she could have prevented all this at any point in time.\n\n"—anyway, Daring was going to ask you if you'd become the next Princess, since there's nopony else who'd fit for the role." The abrupt statement brought Twilight out of her reminiscing (and self-deprecation). Her? The Princess of Equestria? Sometimes she liked to imagine receiving that honour from Celestia, but now... Now ponies have shown that they don't need alicorn princesses doing all the hard decisions for them. With a heavy sigh, she raised her muzzle to look at the pegasus properly. Hope and embarrassment were equally divided in Rainbow's expression.\n\n"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but I don't think I can live up to Celestia's example. After everything, how can I trust myself not to let ponies down?" With winds taken out of Dash's wings, Twilight felt another tinge of pain at letting her friends down. "But what I can do is promise to be around and help anypony in need. I'm sure there's still plenty of use for my magic."\n\nThis mellowed her enough to resume floating off the ground, and just like nothing happened, Rainbow Dash continued indulging in another display of hero worship, as if nothing happened a moment before."

 daring_resistance.22.desc:0 "Crescent Glow and her staff looked over the documents laid before them. It was only supposed to be a minor investigation, but one lead led to another, and then...\n\nThe war room's central table practically overflowed with evidence to the point that Crescent now had irrefutable proof that Chiropterra had directed a secret program known as "Project Moonshine." It was clear that the primary goal of that project was to destabilize Equestria leading up to the Equestrian Civil War. Countless resources had been poured into all sorts of areas to sabotage industries and increase racial tensions. Most curiously, however, a significant number of sleeper agents had been activated and redirected toward Manehattan's central square just before the civil war broke out.\n\n"But what was Chiropterra doing in Manehattan?" One stallion asked. Crescent wracked her brain. The city was strategically important, yes, but to pour this much effort into one specific part of the city surely meant that—\n\nTime seemed to freeze as the realization struck Crescent. It was them. They caused the explosion at Princess Luna's speech. They... they almost killed her. They were willing to risk KILLING Luna if it meant a chance at turning her into Nightmare Moon again.\n\nAny doubt in her mind about the Chiropterrans was gone now. They were absolutely irredeemable monsters. And they had the gall to call themselves Lunarists.\n\nCrescent's lieutenants became worried when they noticed that she was staring wide-eyed at the evidence on the table. "General? Are you okay?"\n\nHer response, though delayed, was unnaturally calm. "Do we still have one of the ponies responsible for this in custody?"\n\n"Yes, one confirmed sleeper agent - a female thestral. She's currently being held in a local jail cell."\n\nCrescent turned to leave, barely concealing the unbridled rage she felt toward the pariah state."

 daring_resistance.23.desc:0 ""YOU RUINED HER!"\n\n"We freed her. You just won't accept our Goddess for who she really is."\n\nCrescent Glow was about to burst a blood vessel. When she had received a report that a spy was captured attempting to sabotage her efforts to deradicalize the thestrals, she wanted to personally interrogate the mare. What had begun as a polite conversation quickly turned into a one-sided shouting match as Crescent learned that the pony sitting before her was not actually a local, but instead an agent from Chiropterra who had helped in turning Luna back into Nightmare Moon. The mare didn't even try to hide it; she seemed proud of herself.\n\n"She was the Goddess of the Night, not Nightmares! Almost a decade of rehabilitation was wasted because of YOU!" Crescent furiously jabbed a hoof into the spy's chest, knocking her and her chair to the ground.\n\nThe mare remained smug. "Luna was a false goddess. A prison made by Celestia and her 'elements of harmony' in order to keep her weak and subservient. Any servant of the night can see that Nightmare Moon is our true goddess."\n\nCrescent felt a tooth crack from how hard she was clenching her teeth. She descended upon the mare and furiously pounded the spy's face with her hooves. "LUNA! WAS! MY! GODDESS!" She screamed as tears began to form in her eyes. "SHE WAS EVERYTHING TO ME! AND YOU TOOK HER AWAY!"\n\nThe mare opened her mouth for another rebuttal but quickly was met with another rage-filled hoof to the face. Fortunately for both Crescent's temper and the mare's skull, the door to the interrogation room swung open and several ponies flooded in to restrain Crescent.\n\n"General Glow!" one of the guards said as they pulled her away from the Chiropterran thestral, "Calm down! You can't assault prisoners like that!" Despite their numbers, they struggled to keep their superior officer away from the now-bleeding mare. It was only when one guard put her into a chokehold did she begin to come to her senses.\n\nAfter calming down, Crescent was released. One of the guards asked if she was okay, but she shook her head. "No. This pony and her kind have poisoned us for generations." She glanced back at the pony who had caused irreprable harm to Equestria, to Luna, and to her. "Contact Commander Daring...""

The only thing that gave her pause was her best friend. Good Word stood just outside Daring's office, firmly barring the way despite knowing Crescent could easily brush past him.\n\n"Crescent, stop. We need to talk about this. You can't just murder all of the Chiropterrans."\n\nShe glared at him. "It won't be murder. It will be justice."\n\n"We can bring those responsible for turning Luna into Nightmare Moon to justice without killing everypony in Chiropterra."\n\n"I don't care. They're evil, every single one of them. I want them all dead."\n\nGood Word's steadfast expression faltered at her comment. "Genocide is not going to bring her back."\n\n"And letting that terrorist state continue to exist will?"\n\nGood Word placed his hoof on her shoulder, "Crescent, please... this isn't right. You know that this won't make things better. You KNOW that. We can make them pay without executing them all."\n\nShe nearly pushed her way past him, but the desperation in his voice gave her pause. "...What alternative do we have?"\n\n"We can teach them the truth about the horrible things they have done. It might take decades, but we can change them like you've helped change Lunarist culture here in Equestria." He gave her a half-hearted smile, "Or... or we could prove to them that we're stronger than the Equestria of old. That we don't have to fight them, because nopony, not cultists, not the changelings, not even rogue alicorns can stand up to us when we work together." He paused, then stood away from the door he was blocking. "I'll support you either way. Just please... use your heart.""

Statues and emblems of Celestia and her cutie mark had either been defaced or entirely destroyed, and in some places the remaining pieces had yet to be cleared. Perhaps it was his imagination, but it seemed many of the city's important hallmarks were missing from its skyline.\n\nThough Canterlot was not fully secured, he had insisted on seeing what had befallen the city he so desperately wanted to visit as a colt. Good Word tightly clutched his Journal of Friendship as he walked through the streets, past the occasional barely washed-out bloodstain and the many ruined buildings. Traversing the once-bustling metropolis saddened him beyond belief, but there was a second emotion beneath it, gnawing at his heart. Good Word turned a street corner. Disbelief, maybe? Disappointment? He did not know. He did not know what he felt, and he did not know how this could have happened. It seemed... impossible. How could Princess Celestia let this happen? She was supposed to protect her ponies.\n\nHe pushed the thought out of his head as he continued towards the palace. Though he knew he would regret looking, he carried on, because he had to see it. When it finally came into view, the knot in his gut tightened as he approached the main gate. What spires had survived were covered in bullet holes. The world-famous garden had been trampled and burned, and its decorations ravaged. Canterlot had well and truly fallen. Gulping, he marched on.\n\nNo guards stood outside the throne room. When he entered, he slumped to the ground as the knot fell into the pit of his stomach. The two statues by the entrance had been reduced to rubble, and nearly every stained glass window had been shattered. But he had expected that. He had not expected the throne itself to have been smashed, its golden pieces strewn across the white marble floor. Celestia had well and truly fallen.\n\nEven Celestia could fail." # Etyco
 daring_resistance.25.desc_daybreaker:0 "While the liberation of Canterlot was a momentous occasion in Daring Do's quest to restore Equestria, nopony could have expected what became of the city after Celestia's transformation into Daybreaker. Statues and emblems of Celestia and her cutie mark were replaced with fiery symbols and twisted idols that seemed to radiate heat. The welcoming, majestic architecture had been demolished and rebuilt with sacral designs.\n\nThough it had been some time since the city was reclaimed, the ravages of war still remained. Some areas and buildings contained Solarist holdouts, while ruins and the occasional bloodstain were present elsewhere.\n\nGood Word tightly clutched his Journal of Friendship as he trotted through the streets. While Canterlot was not fully secured, he knew he had to see what had befallen the city he so desperately wanted to visit as a colt. Merely traversing the once-bustling metropolis made him uncomfortable. What really sent chills down his spine, however, were the looming temples bearing the imagery of Daybreaker.\n\nHe stopped outside one such temple. It was mostly intact, though the symbol of the Solar Empire was cracked above the front entrance. He hesitated as he approached the door. He had to know what these ponies were like. He had to know just how misplaced his own faith in Celestia was.\n\nThe inside of the temple contained a deathly silence that seemed to reverberate louder than artillery fire. A stained-glass image of Daybreaker above the central altar illuminated the red and golden decor. Toppled pews and religious tapestry were strewn about. What caught his eye was a dried trail of blood leading into one of the rear chambers.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, Good Word followed the trail. His heart sank as he found a corpse — a soldier of the Solar Empire. The pony was young, likely not even twenty. It seemed like they had been mortally injured and crawled across the ground to a statue of Daybreaker. Their front hooves were clasped together before the figure, almost as if they had desperately prayed for help from the goddess that had commanded them to die in her name.\n\nEvery second he spent staring at the soldier, Good Word felt more and more sick. He fell to his knees as he contemplated his entire life. How he had spent years in service of a pony that had abandoned everything that he believed in? What might have befallen him if he had been in Canterlot instead of Stableside when Celestia had transformed? Would he have found the strength to do the right thing? Or might he have joined her? He didn't want to know the answer."

A shame, really, because that meant he would need to get up and start his day. Rolling out of bed, he headed for the restroom to brush his teeth, mane, and coat, but when he saw himself in the mirror, he paused. How much had he slept recently? Not enough, given the bags under his eyes.\n\nGood Word sighed, picking up his toothbrush. Maybe tonight he would be tired enough to overcome the seemingly endless supply of thoughts, doubts, and questions that lately kept him up well into the night. Probably not, but he had to hold onto something to push through the day, to push through another day of inconsequential paperwork, of forced smiles for unimportant officials, of speeches he barely believed in.\n\nHe didn't want to. He knew he had to, but with each day since his visit to Canterlot, it only grew harder to press on. Would it really be so bad if he skipped just one day? If he had somepony fill in for him? He shook his head. Of course it would. Princess Celestia wouldn't dodge her duties like that.\n\nBut Celestia had failed; even somepony as grand as her could fall short.

 daring_resistance.26.desc_daybreaker:0 "This had to be a mistake. It couldn't be true, he thought. Good Word knew that some members of the Friendship Lodge had trouble accepting that Celestia had spurned harmony, but this... he glared at the photos on his desk that were taken as a part of an investigation into several missing ponies.\n\nSeveral Moonspeakers from Ayacachtli had been strung up and burned in ritualistic pyres, and the culprits behind these heinous acts were former members of the Friendship Lodge. One photo contained a clear image of a pony he knew personally, Fiery Brimstone, wearing a red and golden robe taken from one of the Solar Empire's many temples.\n\nGood Word sat back in his chair and tried not to think about anything. Yet he found himself looking over to the transcript of the interrogation with the murderers. They seemed to cherry-pick messages from the Journal of Friendship and twist them to fit their worldview. Most did not see their actions as immoral, and some even went so far as to claim that they were doing the right thing by "protecting their friends" via "cleansing their souls of sin."\n\n"How can I preach about friendship if others can twist it into something so vile?" He wondered aloud.\n\nThrough the corner of his eye, Celestia's smiling portrait continued to judge him.\n\nIt was all too much. Everything was wrong, everything he believed in was a lie, and it was his own faith that caused those poor ponies to suffer. He leaped from his chair and tore down the portrait from the wall. He snapped it into two and hurled it across the room, cracking the outside window in the process. He toppled the bookshelves, upheaved his desk, smashed every light, then finally curled up into a ball as he spiraled further and further into despair." #Podrick

He wore a gut-wrenching, heartbroken smile. "If someone as grand as her can screw it up, what chance do us normal ponies have?"\n\nCrescent carefully considered her next words, extending a wing over his withers. "I think that is where you have it backwards, my friend." He looked at her, eyebrow raised. "In times like these, we need to stick together, and we each need to do our part.

It looked like a tornado had torn it apart; it was difficult to see anything due to the broken lights. "Are you in here?" she asked as she carefully stepped inside. Her ears perked up at the faint sound of sobbing. She made her way over to the noise, only to see her friend huddled in the corner behind a toppled bookshelf.\n\n"Go away."

"I spent my entire life believing that Celestia was the most perfect pony to ever live. That she could do no wrong. I taught so many ponies the lessons of my beliefs, but now..." He shut his eyes, "...now I don't know what to believe anymore."\n\n"How about your friends?"

But know that is false! We are all proud of you! Proud of your sheer loyalty to Equestria! You are here because you see her for the evil she is! A tyrant who thinks shedding the blood of our friends and family can bring salvation! You know better than that! You know that you would never let Equestria live under her sickening shawl of darkness! With your gun in your hooves, look beyond the horizon!" He shouted, having positioned them to face north. "She waits for you because she knows that is your home, and she knows you are too valiant to let your home burn! But even if she expects you to be brave, she can never imagine neither the strength of your resolve, nor the size of your heart! Together, we will put an end to evil and darkness! We will not stop until harmony is returned! Now, shout so that she can hear us all the way through these thick jungles, and carry our words to her very ears halfway across this continent — what do we fight for!?"\n\nProudly looking North, the soldiers raised their chins and cried:\n\n"For Equestria!""

Rumor had it that this was one of many spots where Nightmare Moon's supporters took off a thousand years ago to bide their time for revenge. Fitting that the tarnished side of their legacy would end here.\n\nEarth ponies, pegasi, unicorns, and a notable number of thestrals had arrived. Though a few wore suits and uniforms, many Chiropterrans hadn't exactly been big shots in their local politics scene. A grand number had strode into the event with rather casual clothes and rather blank slates—like they once did with a Lord or Lady Commander, they looked up to this new pith-helmeted liberator.\n\n"The old Chiropterra is defeated, but that's the easy part. It's harder to rebuild, much harder when you think could these ponies could never ever change from the 'nightmares' they used to be. But the average pony there? They had no idea the legions were doing half the tragedies we'd found out. So, I say we move onward. The elements of harmony can appear in many different ways, and in Chiropterra, its light can shine a new color: we won't see each other as just four equal tribes but as friends until the very end, and like friends, we'll help each other up. Carrot Stick, may you do the honours?"\n\nA modestly dressed thestral stood up, introducing himself as the interim head of Chiropterra. Against wartime tales of "bats" haunting them in their sleep and at every corner, Carrot exuded a soft yet warm demeanour, greeting with and meeting everyone in a spirit of optimism. No doubt they'd get to know more of him and the fate of a new Chiropterra over the coming years..."

Though he was a ponies' pony, he still had his limits, and after enduring meeting after meeting after meeting, he was glad to finally get a break. Little did he know, his break would be short-lived, as the bench he had just picked out was already occupied. "Daring Do," he said, "it is... certainly a surprise to find you here."\n\nDaring had somehow not noticed him until then, and turned to him, furrowing her brow. "Good... evening, Caballeron."\n\n"Did I surprise you, Miss Do? It is unlike you to let your guard down. Are you perhaps getting old?" Daring merely shook her head as she looked away, too lost in her thoughts to pay him any heed, leaving Caballeron to blink at her for a few moments. "Should I be aware of anything that may have happened?"\n\n"Little more than a bout of contemplative melancholy, as can happen to anypony."\n\n"Must be rather serious, for you to talk like a third rate novellist." Still, Daring continued to ignore his quips, and after a few moments, he cleared his throat. "At any rate, if it is serious, I would rather know, as I dislike unfortunate surprises."\n\nDaring sighed. "It isn't, but if you must know, I've just been stuck pondering the fate of the two sisters." When she finally looked at him again, her eyes utterly lacked their usual fire. She had neither the patience for him, nor any desire to play games. "Like how they both ultimately just wanted the best for Equestria, but couldn't agree how, and how it tore them apart." Another sigh. "And worse, Equestria itself is now lost because of it." After a short silence, she shrugged. "Like I said, it's nothing important. I only told you so you'd get off my case." Or maybe she just wanted to get it off her mind; not even she knew.\n\nCaballeron just nodded for a while as they sat there, leaving Daring more and more confused. What was he playing at? Was he— "Now that you mention it, it reminds me of us. Or rather, how we could have ended up. We could have let our differences become our demise, but we haven't, and for that I am grateful."\n\nDaring could only nod.

The [HIP.GetNameDefCap] armada was a sight to behold, especially as they had brought quite the fleet to ensure that any potential third parties would think twice about interfering with the meeting between Daring Do and Posada.\n\nThe former adventurer was adorned in her signature outfit, grinning as she took in both the view and the gravity of the alliance she was about to secure. "You know, a few of my advisors told me I was foolish to even consider asking for help from a communist state."\n\n"And a few of mine told me that you were just another absolute dictator who answers to no one," Posada extended a claw to her, notably not as uncomfortable in her hippogriff form as she usually felt, "But when I heard of the reactionaries who would control Equus if you were to fall, I knew we had to do something."\n\n"I'm only leading until Equestria is whole again," Daring took the hippogriff's claw in her hoof and shook it for the cameras, "We've established a republic and elected a civilian president."\n\n"I know. It's a shame you didn't embrace communist principles, but I applaud your treatment of the socialist movement in Baltimare. Pardoning all of them, and even implementing some of their policies into your government? I was already a fan of your actions in your stories, but now I'm practically a super-fan!"

"Would it be okay to get Yearling to sign them back home?"\n\n"Oh, Skystar, don't you know? We're one and the same. Yearling's just a pen name I made up; I've always been Daring Do."\n\nBefore Skystar could squee more, a thought hit her—one of Yearling. That perennial smile of hers finally diminished. "I guess it makes sense why nopony's seen Yearling for a long time now, huh?"\n\n"Yeah, she's... let's just say the world's needs a hero, not a writer."

But visiting you, Skystar, being in another country to ask for help... it's..." Warmth flooded her all around—Skystar had leaped and given her a hug. Daring had to take it in, patting Skystar all the while. "W-well, I guess... I'd never been a proper leader like a princess or a queen before this happened. This world may love heroes, but it needs more than just heroes."\n\n"You're right," Skystar said.

On top of that, they still needed to figure out how to properly integrate the Southeast into the Solar Empire. Unfortunately, both of these issues fell to the wayside the moment the topic of Celestia's transformation came up.\n\n"Celestia is perfect! We should strive to be like her, no matter what form she takes!"\n\n"I don't know, something about this Daybreaker makes me shiver. She doesn't feel like the Celestia we know and love."\n\nThe debate soon turned into a heated argument, then into a shouting match just short of a brawl as ponies began to take sides. Accusations of treachery and conspiracy were flung back and forth; it seemed like a schism in the Friendship Lodge would have formed right then and there were it not for a new arrival whose entrance shocked all present into reverent silence.\n\n"Brothers and sisters," the familiar-looking earth pony gently shut the door shut behind him, "This is unbecoming of Celestia's most faithful," Covered in bandages from head to hoof, the once ever-cheerful Good Word now seemed to emit an aura of righteous fervor as he made his way to the podium. "Do you not remember our first statute? 'Thou shalt love Celestia with all thy heart, all thy might, mind, and strength, and in Her name we shall serve Her until our last breath.'"\n\nHis voice carried a commanding tone that washed away the doubts of most of the ponies present. Still, a few were still unconvinced. "But what if Celestia's transformation is akin to Luna's? This doesn't feel right!"\n\nGood Word's gaze seemed to bore into their very souls. "Need I also remind you of one of the most important lessons in the Friendship Journal? 'Never judge a book by its cover. And a good friend, like a good book, will last forever.' Celestia may look different, but it is still Her. She will always protect us, so long as we are faithful to Her." He pointed to the exit, "If you disagree with anything that I have said, then I invite you to resign immediately."\n\nThe ponies present looked at each other, but this time with comfort instead of frustration now that their president sounded more like a prophet."

 daring_solar.2.desc:0 "While previously the Friendship Lodge was always a loosely connected ponytarian network devoted to preaching about Celestia, the advent of her transformation combined with the spiritual rebirth of Good Word seemed to trigger a sudden change in the entire organization. Gone were any doubts about Celestia's status as a divine figure. Good Word had rapidly become a rallying leader even more so than Daring Do was, for how could he have survived such an inferno if he was not personally blessed by Celestia?\n\nAs news of Good Word's survival spread throughout the southeast, the Friendship Lodge's membership had practically skyrocketed. Almost a hundred thousand ponies from all walks of life had signed up just within a week; some because they believed that Celestia could do no wrong, while others saw the "Burned Stallion" as a sorely needed voice to guide them in these tumultuous times.\n\nAnd guide them he would.\n\nThe first changes were subtle: A few Lodge-aligned amendments were made to the fledgling republic's constitution. Funds were set aside to construct additional Lodges. Less devout members of parliament were replaced with more fervent ones.\n\nTo any outside observer, especially the most devout Lunarists in Ayacachtli, it looked like the beginnings of a cult takeover. They began to take measures to protect themselves from being purged, but no attempt at removing the thestrals ever came. The missionaries from the Friendship Lodge continued to make their humble journeys to proselytize, the only difference being a spark in their eyes that wasn't there before. They spoke of Good Word almost as if he was equal in status to Twilight Sparkle, if not more so. As if Celestia had personally granted him that status."

Ponies already spoke highly of Celestia, but now they made snide remarks to those who did not praise her. Phrases such as "We love Celestia" became "We worship Celestia."\n\nLunarist holdouts became worried. What was going on? Many of them were terrified that something big was about to happen, especially as the weeks went on, but nopony had come for them yet. Still, they continued to turn away the Friendship Lodge's missionaries, nonviolently of course, in hopes that they would be left alone.\n\nStrangely enough, despite all of the official missives coming in from the Solar Empire, the ponies of the southeast did not refer to the Goddess as Daybreaker, instead choosing to continue calling her Celestia. Their reasons varied, though the most consistent answers given were as thus: "Celestia will always be our Goddess, no matter what form she takes."\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all was the number of Lodges that had appeared in the wake of Good Word's return. Before they had scattered the land with only a few in each major city, now there were dozens in almost every town, with some even having over a hundred. The weekly services of the Friendship Lodge saw more and more ponies adopting their beliefs, with some places having so many attending these services that businesses were forced to close on those days."

There were brief gasps of shock as all present realized that Good Word had just executed the mare.\n\nRaising his pistol into the air, Good Word addressed all of the ponies before him, "Heed my words: That mare held a deep-seated hatred for all thestrals within her. It clouded her judgment and would have led to unjustified acts of violence against bat ponies. Let it be known that all are equal in the eyes of the Goddess, regardless of heritage, regardless of status, and regardless of race." He set his pistol down, then returned to his seat. "If any other members of the Friendship Lodge hold similar sentiments to this heretic, know they shall suffer the same fate."\n\nNaught but silence followed his statement. With a nod, Good Word turned to address the thestrals who had trapped him inside of his burning office, "'Guilty on all charges', was it? Perhaps punishment is in order for you all...""

Nearly every pony who had an issue with the Friendship Lodge was willing to cease their heretical activities if it meant that they would be left alone.\n\nUnfortunately, not all accepted Good Word's generous offer.

When she was first placed there, she was assured that she'd only be there temporarily until they figured out who had burned down the capitol building. But as time went on, it became clear that something else was keeping her here. She had asked what was going on, and was informed that the "highest authority" had ordered her to be kept there "for the foreseeable future."\n\nAnd so there she remained. She'd repeatedly asked to see some of her friends, namely Crescent Glow and Chief Maita, only to be informed that both of them had resigned from government affairs. She had also asked to see Good Word, and was told that he would come see her when he was free. Additionally, she found it peculiar that more of the prison staff were wearing Friendship Lodge outfits now than they did last month.\n\nThat day happened to be today. Daring was just beginning to consider counting the cracks in the ceiling when she heard the cellblock door open. "About time," she muttered. She hopped out of the uncomfortable bed and walked up to the bars. She peeked through them to see her friend... what the heck was wrong with him? "Good Word? Is that you? What in Tartarus happened to you?"\n\nThe bandage-covered stallion nodded, "Rebirth, my friend. I apologize for not making time to see you sooner, as I have been very busy handling the many affairs that come with governing this land. How are you doing?"\n\n"Great, now that you're here!

 daring_solar.13.desc:0 "Ever since the founding of Equestria, the grand city of Tenochtitlan has been a premier tourist destination for ponies all around the country. The Neighua tribe who built the city were a curious sort — while most of them had adopted modern technology and other Equestrian customs, many went out of their way to preserve their culture's traditions and unique architecture, often to the point of frustration with regional authorities.\n\nThese frustrations only intensified after the Friendship Lodge became the de facto government of the Equestrian Southeast. New rules and laws were passed throughout the land, many of which conflicted with the Neighua tribe's beliefs. However, persistent visits by Lodge missionaries persuaded a significant chunk of the Neighua to let go of their old ways.\n\nUnfortunately, they did not persuade all of them. Tensions between those who clung to their traditions and those who adopted Lodge customs skyrocketed in the recent weeks after a particularly divisive law was enacted. It seemed like the constant heated arguments in the streets might descend into outright chaos any day now.\n\nFriendship Lodge authorities were understandably worried that a riot was imminent. They began to theorize several ideas to calm the populace but were shocked when the prophet volunteered to travel to the city himself. Some attempted to reason with him, saying that it was not safe, but Good Word was not dissuaded. He would bring peace to Tenochtitlan with Celestia as his witness."

The ancient teocalli, similar in structure to Maregyptian pyramids, were a sight to behold, but they were currently closed due to the unrest. As the mobs protested one another, a single earth pony began to ascend the steps of the teocalli. He listened to the two sides as he went — many were upset about being forced to obey the new laws that infringed upon their ancient traditions, while others were frustrated that those traditionalists would get them in trouble with the Friendship Lodge and the Solar Empire.\n\nUpon reaching the top of the structure, Good Word raised his gun and fired it into the air, silencing most of the crowd. He saw countless heads turn towards him, some annoyed, some curious. Nevertheless, he immediately began to speak before their attention returned to one another.\n\n"I was once unsure of who I wanted to be when I was young. I held so much self-doubt that it took my father's death to push me out of the comfort zone of my indecision. I chose to embrace the Friendship Lodge, for their lessons of unity and goodwill in the name of Celestia brought joy to my heart. I sorely needed that joy, as the insecurity in my soul constantly resurfaced whenever I was not helping others.\n\n"But the Lodge alone could not save me from the disharmony in my heart. I sought others to help me," he briefly hesitated, as he was reminded of his friends who were no longer with him, "They taught me an important lesson — that contention with one another is a poison that rots the soul and destroys our bonds."\n\nGood Word's voice rose as he replaced the gun in his hoof with his scripture, "I stand before you not as a preacher, not as a prophet, but as a beggar. Disharmony is not the path we should walk. We should not be contentious with one another, but we should look forward with one eye, having one faith, with our hearts knit together in unity and love towards one another!" He paused for emphasis. "The day will come when Celestia will judge us all. Until then, we must honor Her laws and start others along the path of salvation. Should you disregard my words and seek to disrupt the unity we seek, know this: You shall not succeed. All trials and tribulations can be overcome, for our faith renders us invincible!"\n\nThe sun began to rise behind him as he spoke his final words. Whether it was immaculate timing or divine intervention, none knew. "And this I say unto you: if you wish to join the path of righteousness, step forward, and be forever blessed by Celestia!""

There had been quite the political upheaval once they had realized how much they had to change their fledgling republic's laws to be in line with the Solar Empire's, and they seemed to exhaust themselves debating the fine details and how to best implement them. The most contested topic was the recently-passed proposal to grant several positions of authority to the Friendship Lodge.\n\nPerhaps it was because of their meticulous focus on legal matters that they seemed to be unaware that the various entry and exit points of the building had been boarded up and sealed. Only when the smoke alarms triggered did the various politicians begrudgingly begin to leave their seats. Unfortunately for them, the emergency exits didn't budge. A few opened the rear doors to the rest of the building, causing searing heat and smoke to billow in.\n\nWith that smoke came a wave of panic as ponies screamed and ran over each other trying to find a way out. Their efforts to escape were for naught, however, as whoever had blocked the exits from the outside had done a thorough job to ensure that nopony could escape.\n\nThe fire rose, and their hearts became filled with despair. One stallion even knelt in prayer, but in the end, the fire consumed him as well.\n\n---\n\nIt wasn't until after emergency services had finally managed to put out the fires that destroyed the capitol building did the full extent of the death toll become apparent: There were no survivors.

We were thus forced to apprehend her. She denied any involvement in the burning of the capitol, but her comments alone warranted keeping her in custody for now.\n\nFollowing the capture of the Commander, we received a missive from the Solar Empire congratulating us on "doing the right thing" in regards to not allowing dissent from anyone, including our leaders.

She approached Good Word and wrapped her hooves around the cell bars. "Justify your actions all you want. It won't change what you are: a murderer."\n\nDespite the criticism of the former Commander, Good Word's zeal never faltered. "Deep down, I was hoping you would see the glory of Celestia's light. Perhaps this was a foolish wish on my part. If you do not accept Her divinity, then you shall meet the same end as all those who hide from the sun. I shall give you some time to reconsider where your faith lay — in Her, or yourself. I pray that you choose the former." He turned to leave, secretly hoping that he wouldn't have to resort to such a drastic action for his former friend."

Seated in the rear of one of the Friendship Lodge's weekly congregations, they were the only bat ponies present. The only Lunarists present. Cricket was apphrensive the moment they had set hoof into the Lodge, having only shown up out of obligation from the kind acts of the missionaries. His wife and foals were equally on edge; it didn't help that their dark, moon-themed clothing made them stand out like a sore hoof.\n\nIn stark contrast, the members of the Friendship Lodge all wore neat, tidy, and simple outfits with a Celestia pin on them. A few approached the family to welcome them, and some even offered to sit with them and guide them through the proceedings. Cricket didn't want to come off as rude, but thankfully his wife took the initiative to politely decline any offers for company.\n\nThe sermon they had expected turned out not to be a sermon at all, but instead a brief speech from a Senior Lodger who affirmed her faith in Celestia's perfection. She then invited the congregation to share their "Thoughts and Testimonies" and left the pulpit open for any to approach it.\n\nOver the next hour, roughly a dozen ponies of all kinds stepped forward to speak of how impactful the Friendship Lodge has been on their life, how much more confident they've become since devoting themselves to Celestia, and how blessed they are to have a living goddess to look up to. Truthfully, Cricket found himself paying more attention to the clock than to the speakers, but the last pony to step up immediately caught his attention: It was his squadmate, a pegasus who served alongside him at the beginning of the Lunar Civil War.\n\nCricket was utterly transfixed on the stallion who had once sworn his life to serve Nightmare Moon. A stallion who was dead set on becoming a Moonspeaker. A stallion who had gagged at the mention of Celestia's name. A stallion who was now crying tears of joy while speaking of how wrong he was in the past and how thankful he was for the Friendship Lodge's forgiveness, even when he had spent years fighting against Celestia.\n\nWhen the service was over, Cricket Chirp felt a new sensation in his heart: Desire. He wanted to know more— No, he needed to know more. What could change a pony like that?"

Cricket and his wife had initially sworn to resist their new government's policies, but their resolve crumbled when their young foals began to show signs of malnutrition. Now they were here in the pews amongst "Celestia's" faithful.\n\nIn stark contrast to his family's dark, moon-themed clothing, the members of the Friendship Lodge all word neat, tidy, and simple outfits with a Celestia pin on them.

However, it wasn't until the last speaker stood up that he truly became horrified.\n\nShe was a thestral, like himself. She started by mentioning her late husband, whom Cricket recognized as his former squadmate who served alongside him in the Lunar Civil War. She said that he had started on the path to redemption, but he was struggling to abandon his old ways. She said that she was forced to leave him and take her foals with her so that she could accept Celestia's light. That she found a new husband. That they've never been happier.\n\nDespite the circumstances with her family and his being very different, he found himself tightly gripping his wife's hoof. He tried to steal a glance at her, and she at him, but the confidence they sought in each other seemed to be replaced by fear of what might or might not happen."

Why were they giving aid to Lunarists of all ponies? He examined one of the Friendship Lodge ponies who was speaking with a thestral and his family. The overly cheery mare seemed very concerned with the well-being of those before her, making sure to give them extra supplies and even offering a hug to one of the younger ones.

Those ponies, upon realizing that they were about to aid Lunarists, retracted their supplies and started shouting at them. Wood could make out a few words — "Confess!" "Repent!", "Humble yourselves!". Some of the Lunarists argued with the volunteers but quickly realized that no supplies would be given if they didn't adhere to their benefactor's demands.

The voice trembled with rage.\n\n"Are you so sure?" Good Word set down his book, "Justice can become a mistake with hindsight. I am very familiar with the concept, as I have made many decisions that I've come to regret." Instead of responding, the pony behind him slowly circled around into Good Word's field of view. He was a young thestral adorned in a bloodstained Chiropterran Legionary uniform with bullet holes aplenty, likely taken from a deceased parent. Good Word's eyes darted from his clothes, to his pistol, and then into his eyes that betrayed the fear behind his fury. "Why are you really here?"\n\nThe thestral grit his teeth and screamed, "BECAUSE I HATE YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR!" The trigger for the pistol was pulled slightly, but not enough to fire the bullet.\n\n"I understand. I would hate me too if I stood where you stand. But this is not a path that you want to walk. I have known the anger you feel now. I never thought myself a killer, yet my anger made me into a monster." Good Word rose from his chair and took a step towards the thestral, "But in time I overcame that anger-\n\n"NOT ANOTHER STEP!" The thestral fired his pistol, but his shaking grip caused the bullet to whiz past Good Word's head.\n\n"-and I know that you can overcome that anger too. Don't let it destroy you as it almost destroyed me." Another step. And another.\n\nTears streamed from the thestral's eyes. "STOP IT! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!"\n\nGood Word was right in front of the stallion. "It's all right." He raised a hoof and gently pushed aside the pistol, then hugged the shaking thestral, "I'm sorry about what happened to your kin, I truly am.

Countless Lunarists had fought to the bitter end rather than surrender, and Good Word's forces had to cut down many whom they would have rather taken as prisoners. Some colts and fillies had even taken up the weapons of their deceased parents to exact revenge, leading to even more suffering when they fired upon their conquerors. Still, at the end of it all, Chiropterra fell.\n\nWhen Good Word and his missionaries arrived at the impromptu prison camp that his forces had set up, the worst offenders had already been lined up to await his judgment. A few dozen soldiers, an officer, and three young ones no older than twelve. "What are their crimes?" he asked his subordinate. Rather than answering, the mare gave a hastily written paper with a large number of heinous actions written on it. "Murder. Heresy. Slavery. Torture. Mutilation. False surrender," he paused to look at the youngest ponies present, "Use of child soldiers." He threw the paper aside. "There are more, of course. However, the Friendship Lodge handles prisoners differently. You will be offered the opportunity to abandon your wicked faith and to atone for your sins. If you decline... you cannot say that we didn't offer you salvation."\n\nGood Word nodded at the missionaries and the guards to begin working with their captives to see who could be saved. Shortly after, a shrill battle cry of a young filly interrupted them. Said filly proceeded to retrieve a hidden pistol and shoot two missionaries before she was restrained by a nearby guard.\n\nThe bandaged earth pony briefly closed his eyes. So this was how it would be, he thought. He approached the young filly who was being held to the ground. With one hoof, he brought forth his holy scripture and began to read from it. 'Yea, they who do not hearken unto Celestia's teachings shall seek to take away thy life. And behold, it is better that one wicked pony should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.' He closed his book and drew his gun. The filly's fierce defiance immediately evaporated as Good Word pointed his weapon at her.\n\nFor how long Good Word held his gun steady, he could not say. The expression in the young filly's eyes... it reminded him of something. It wasn't evil that guided this poor soul, it was fear. This foal was terrified of those she had been taught to hate, and she lashed out in the only way she knew how: violence. "Hmph," Good Word lowered his weapon, "Righteous as this killing might be, it would solve nothing. You have fallen, but there is a road to forgiveness for you still. But first..." He raised his gun again and shot one of her legs, causing her to scream in pain. "Your latest sin has been forgiven, but there is still work to be done."" #For many of us, the road is a difficult one, but the path is always there for us to follow, no matter how many times we may fall.

One by one, Good Word made his way through the line of Chiropterra's remaining leadership structure, putting a bullet into each and every pony who did not renounce their faith in Nightmare Moon. Some attempted to plead, and some even said they would repent, but not convincingly enough to prove to their executioner that they were telling the truth.\n\nAs the body count rose, a few of Good Word's subordinates briefly glanced at one another in shock. Not because of the violence, but because not a single Lunarist had genuinely renounced their wicked religion. Didn't they understand that their false goddess had brought them to ruin?\n\nEventually, there were but only a few ponies left in the line: high-ranking refugees from the Lunar Empire and the short-lived Disciples of the Night. Still, they had sought aid from their kin and thus were brought before Good Word to be judged. Said earth pony raised his gun at the next in line. "Repe-" He halted as he realized that he recognized the mare in front of him.\n\nStaring firmly at him with a gun to her forehead was none other than Crescent Glow, the pony that he once called his friend.

You do not follow Nightmare Moon."\n\nShe briefly laughed, but her voice held nothing but pain. "Since when did you care about the difference? My family starved when they sought help from your Lodge and were denied because they weren't members. They couldn't join because they weren't 'devout' enough. I had to flee the country after burying them because you made it illegal to hold funerals for non-members." The fire in her eyes briefly matched his, "I used to think you were my best friend. Maybe more than that. But now? I see you for what you really are: a monster worse than what Daybreaker ever could be."\n\nThe silence that followed was beyond deafening.

While they showed the utmost respect for the Empress and her staff, they seemed to be filled with great reverence, more so than the majority of her subjects in the Empire at large.\n\nTheir request was simple, but not inconsequential: They wished for a percentage of the Solar Empire's navy to be transferred to the Southeast for use in helping the Empress' light "shine over the sea."\n\nWhile Daybreaker did plan to make Chiropterra suffer, she was still busy consolidating her control over Equus. Perhaps an investment into her most devoted subjects could pay dividends... they could deliver the Lunarist holdout to her on a silver platter.

He thought back to the letter that he had received: a direct invitation to come to Canterlot to speak with Empress Daybreaker regarding his "recent conduct." While he intended to leave as soon as possible, he did not expect a sizable Solar Guard escort to show up at his doorstep mere minutes after the letter had arrived.\n\nSoon his entourage arrived in the city proper. They landed just outside of the castle entrance, then informed Good Word that the Empress was waiting inside. He thanked them, then looked up at the double doors emblazoned with the sun. He began to feel apprehensive, which was an unfamiliar sensation. He'd spent his whole life teaching others about Celestia, yet he had never met her before...\n\nHe eventually summoned the courage to go inside. The castle interior was just as wondrous as he had imagined. Glass murals adorned the walls and ceiling, while exquisite banners and other brightly colored decor perfectly complemented the interior. Good Word respectfully kept his hooves to himself as he approached the throne room.\n\nThe guards nodded as they opened the doors, and in the earth pony went. The first thing he noticed was how big the room was — it was larger than the entire Grand Lodge building. The second was the lack of any additional guards. The third was a white pony with a fiery, flowing mane and stern gaze sitting atop a throne. His heart skipped a beat as he saw her looking at him. He immediately bowed as all of his rehearsed greetings seemed to slip away from him.\n\n"Rise," Daybreaker commanded, "I have watched you carefully over these past few years.

"We followed your teachings and sought to spread the truth of your divinity to all who would hear it."\n\nShe laughed again, "But you did not follow my teachings. You followed Celestia's teachings."\n\nThat caused the stoic earth pony's head to tilt. "I... you are Celestia, though?" Good Word asked, somewhat confused.\n\nHer gaze bored into him. "Because you have done so well, I will forgive that misconception. I'm the better, prettier, and more powerful version of Celestia." She made a dramatic show of extending the flames in her mane. "However, I will humor you. You and your Lodge may continue to call me Celestia, despite the... unorthodox beliefs you hold."\n\nGood Word stared at her briefly, then nodded once more. "I see." He stopped for a moment, "Is there anything else that I and the Friendship Lodge can do for you?"\n\nDaybreaker grinned exultantly, "Why, yes. You have all proven yourselves to be devout servants, and I am not above recognizing you as such. Therefore, I am hereby granting you full autonomy to serve me as you see fit, rather than to be subject to the examinations and red tape of my bureaucracy. After all, they aren't half as faithful as you are."\n\n"Thank you, Goddess Celestia."\n\nShe waved her hoof to dismiss him. Just as he was about to exit the room, she called out, "One more thing: This 'religion' of yours.

Do the same for all those who reject me as their rightful ruler."\n\nGood Word firmly nodded one last time."

"Explain yourself, now!"\n\nGood Word bowed deeply before her, "We followed your teachings and sought to spread the truth of your divinity to all-"\n\n"You did not follow my teachings at all. You followed Celestia's," Daybreaker practically spat at the name of her former self, "She was weak. Kindness and mercy are not conducive to a strong empire, and that is why Equestria crumbled the moment a breeze knocked on it."\n\nThe earth pony didn't quite know what to say to that. "We did not aim to displease you-"\n\n"Silence!" Daybreaker bellowed, sending out a wave of heat that nearly knocked Good Word to the ground. "I should never have allowed your organization to exist. Every day I kept hearing more and more heretical activities in the Southeast, and every day I felt the urge to go down there and cleanse it myself. The only reason I let your disobedience persist for so long was because of some vain hope that I wouldn't have to devote my precious time and resources to fixing you and this Lodge of yours." Her gaze bored into him. "But now I can see that you are beyond fixing."\n\nGood Word rose to his hooves again with a fire of his own in his voice. "We converted the Lunarists, though! They love you, just as we do! As I do!"\n\n"You love me?" Daybreaker cackled, "Please. You are a pathetic excuse for a pony who had the potential to be a devout servant of mine, but your flame mellowed out as you clung to a false version of me. You are no better than the 'Lunarists' who no doubt secretly practice their heretical beliefs behind your back."\n\nGood Word opened his mouth again to respond, but Daybreaker magically constricted his neck and flung him to the ground once more. When he looked up, he saw the almighty goddess of the sun rising into the air as a blindingly bright sun appeared from her horn. "Any last words, you insolent worm?"\n\nThe earth pony rose one last time. "Yes," he said. After what seemed like an eternity, Good Word retrieved his gun and pointed it at the deity in front of him. "Crescent was right about you." He pulled the trigger as the light consumed him."

Your kind always listens to what you think I want rather than what I actually want."\n\nGood Word was taken aback by the brazen behavior of the alicorn he held in such high regard. "May I ask what we did to displease you, Celestia?"\n\nThe flames in Daybreaker's mane flared momentarily. "That. That is what you do and keep doing despite all of the evidence in the world saying that you are wrong." She stomped her hoof for emphasis, "Celestia is not my name— I am DAYBREAKER! I'm better, prettier, and way, way more powerful than the alicorn who used to sit on this throne! You and your Lodge keep pretending that I'm a nice little goddess who is okay with your brazen disregard for my wishes. It used to be cute to play along, but now?" Her face contorted into disgust, "It's annoying. I alone know what is best for my subjects. From now on, you will do exactly what I say, when I say it. Are we clear?"\n\nThe normally stoic earth pony was beset by a whirlwind of conflicting emotions as he processed what she was saying. After a moment, he settled on nodding. "I... yes, Ce-Daybreaker."\n\n"However," The alicorn allowed herself a smirk, "I am not above recognizing when my subjects surprise me, as you have. I did not think it was possible for my 'sister''s followers to be brought to heel, but you have managed to convert them of all things. I was making preparations for a more brutal form of subjugation, but thanks to you, that is no longer necessary. For this reason, I will not only spare your life, but I will also allow you to remain in control of the Southeast."\n\nGood Word bowed before her, "They were... difficult to manage, at times. I had faith that they would come around, and they did."\n\nHe did not see Daybreaker roll her eyes. "Yes, quite. Still, I expect you and your Lodge to adhere to my wishes. And my first wish for you is to ensure that every citizen of the Southeast understands that I do not want them to behave impulsively. They must be obedient, as I expect you to be."\n\nThe earth pony closed his eyes as he mentally scorned himself for misjudging his goddess' will. "Of course.""

This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours bears much resemblance to many cults that Celestia had put down over the centuries. Though yours..." Daybreaker paused to muse, "Perhaps this is why she had been so adamant about crushing organized religion."\n\nGood Word didn't quite know what to say to that. "Everything action we have taken was done in your name, Goddess Celestia."\n\nHer gaze bored into him. "Misconception after misconception. My name is Daybreaker, and I am the better, prettier, and more powerful version of Celestia. But you already knew that, didn't you? You just chose to ignore it in favor of your deified version of me, much like how you have ignored some of my other orders." She stopped again for effect, then sighed, "However, I cannot say that you have done the worst job ever. My 'sister''s followers are stubborn, and yet their rebellious nature has been quelled by your... organization."\n\nThe earth pony was silent for some time. "I... we did what we thought you wanted."\n\nThe flames in Daybreaker's mane briefly extended, sending a wave of heat at the mortal before her. "I *wanted* you to cement my authority in the Southeast and to show leniency to all but the most determined insurgents. You did the former, but several ponies convicted of minor crimes now either languish in prison or have been shunned from society. They will grow to become resentful of you, and by extension, me. Given enough time, they will become a greater problem than even the worst dissidents today."\n\nDespite the heat, Good Word stared directly at her. "What would you have us do?"\n\n"Pardon those who do not worship me as you do." The fiery alicorn placed a hoof on her temple, "If I had known that your organization leading the Southeast would lead to the situation we are in, then I would have had it dismantled long ago. But it is too late for that now. I shall allow you to continue your existence, and despite all of these issues, I will grant you further autonomy to go forth and extend my realm as you see fit."

Yes, you and this 'Friendship Lodge' of yours are fiercely loyal... but not to me."\n\nGood Word lowered his head in reverence, "Have we not done as you commanded, Goddess Celestia?"\n\n"That," Daybreaker bared her teeth, "is precisely the problem. You don't listen to me. You listen to your idealized version of Celestia!" She stomped her hoof as her mane flared. "You should have been worshipping me! Daybreaker, God-Empress of the Sun!"\n\nThe heat in the room briefly rose as the earth pony raised a hoof to shield his face. "We did not aim to displease you. Every action we took had the goal of solidifying your rule."\n\n"Every action you took was aggravating to watch. You lived in your own little world, following rules that almost, but did not perfectly align with my desires. You would spare heretics on one day, and punish traitors on another." Daybreaker pointed her hoof towards stallion before her, "The only positive thing I have to say about you, and the only reason why you are still standing before me, is that you have done what I thought to be impossible: You have subdued the terrorists that were so fond of my 'sister.'"\n\nGood Word chose his words carefully. "The Lunarists required... careful attention. Some needed only a few kind words to convert to our faith, while others needed to be forced to see the light. But they did see, in the end."\n\nThe alicorn rolled her eyes, then begrudgingly nodded. "I would have preferred more excruciating methods, but yours were... effective. Even I am not blind to that." Her gaze became focused again, "Still, you will adhere to my instructions from now on. I am Daybreaker, not Celestia. See to it that your Lodge refers to me as such. Furthermore, I shall allow your organization to continue existing, and I shall grant you the autonomy to go forth and spread my will without the oversight of my inquisitors." She paused for effect, "This will be your last chance to be redeemed. You will not show mercy to any heathens who do not accept me as their Goddess. Do you understand?""

"They were... difficult to manage at times. Their beliefs were strong, but like their goddess, they have been banished away by your brilliant light."\n\nHe did not see Daybreaker roll her eyes. "Yes, quite. However, there is one thing I would like to address: I make a point to my subjects that I, Daybreaker, know what is best for them. They listen to me, or they suffer my wrath." She paused until he lifted his head to look at her, "I have heard that you and your Lodge erroneously refer to me as Celestia despite me enforcing my new image and name across the Empire. Because you have done so well in recent times, I will forgive this error. Make sure it is corrected."\n\n"Of course, Goddess Cel-Daybreaker." Good Word nodded firmly.\n\n"That brings me to my next topic. Your faith was built upon a different idea of what I actually am." She made a dramatic show of extending the flames in her mane. "While it is far too late to change some aspects that irk me, I now see that a new opportunity has opened up— one where my remaining enemies can be brought to heel. Do you understand where I am going with this?"\n\nThe earth pony was silent for a moment. "You mean for me to go forth and conquer in your name?"\n\nThe fiery alicorn grinned, "Precisely, and I shall grant you the autonomy to more easily perform this task. All I want in return is a promise that all my subjects shall praise me as you do."\n\nAs Good Word absorbed her words, he briefly recalled the many ponies who had chosen the pain of death rather than accepting his Goddess' divinity. A part of him wondered how many more would suffer like that. A smaller part of him enjoyed inflicting that pain."

I now know why Celestia was so keen to crush organized religion before it became widespread."\n\n"We did only as you commanded-"\n\n"Lies!" Daybreaker spat at him, "I repeatedly told you to show leniency to dissidents, and what did you do? You shunned them. You imprisoned them. You shot those who still resisted. You forced *everypony* to believe your faith or to suffer, and what will happen because of your actions?

Years from now, they will become a greater problem than even the most troublesome rebels today!"\n\nGood Word shielded his eyes from the heat, "They did not respect you-"\n\nThe earth pony found his neck constricted with magic. Daybreaker jumped off of her throne and began to approach him. "Every week I heard more and more bad news about the Southeast, and each time I hoped that I wouldn't have to divert my attention and resources to fix the problem you were becoming. But now I see that this was a grievous error on my part." She threw him to the ground. "'They did not respect me?' What about you? Do you respect me?"\n\n"Y-yes."

Your religion has eclipsed even my efforts in crafting a loyal and faithful nation, and that is not praise that I give lightly."\n\nGood Word bowed deeply, "Such divinity demands great devotion."\n\n"Indeed," Daybreaker said, "You have done well with punishing those who stood against me. My 'sister''s followers are stubborn, and yet not only have you quelled their rebellious nature, you have thoroughly dismantled the stain that is 'Lunarism' from their culture." She paused to cackle, "I thought that I'd have to resort to burning them at the stake until they quit longing for Nightmare Moon, but you! You *converted* them! I didn't think it was possible!"\n\n"Anything is possible if you have faith in the most perfect pony of all."\n\nDaybreaker practically drunk in his praise. "And I shall reward that faith justly. Though first, I must address a misconception of yours that has irked me somewhat. I have heard that the Friendship Lodge still calls me 'Celestia'. That is not correct. I am the better, prettier, and more powerful version of her." She made a dramatic show of extending the flames in her mane. "However, as you have done such an excellent job in managing the Southeast, I will not punish you for that mistake. Tell your Lodge that I desire for them to call me by who I really am: Daybreaker, God-Empress of the Sun."\n\nThe earth pony raised his head and stared directly at her, "As you command, Goddess Daybreaker. Is there anything else that I and the Friendship Lodge can do for you?"\n\nDaybreaker grinned exultantly, "Why, yes. I am hereby granting you full autonomy to serve me as you see fit. Go forth and spread the truth of my divinity without the watchful eyes of my inquisitors standing over you.

"We believed it best to remove every last trace of doubt about the truth of your divinity."\n\n"And you chose to do this through exceedingly brutal means," Daybreaker pressed a hoof to her forehead, "While you -were- effective in subjugating my 'sister''s followers, the methods you chose might lead to further complications in the future. For instance, what of the young orphans who are conflicted because they are constantly told that I know what is best for them, while at the same time, they resent me and my followers for killing their parents?"\n\nThe earth pony bowed. "Then their convictions shall be tested, and punished if they are found lacking."\n\nHe did not see Daybreaker roll her eyes. "Yes, quite. On another note, you and your Lodge continue to irk me by erroneously referring to me as Celestia despite how I have enforced my new image and name across the Empire. I grow tired of it.

 daring_solar.34.desc:0 "It had been some time since the Friendship Lodge had undergone its transformation into a full state religion. To many, their ways were strange, and their methods of converting nonbelievers even stranger. Yet even with their persistent proselytizing, holdouts of other faiths in the Southeast remained.\n\nThe Moonspeaker Conclave in Ayacachtli was among one such group of holdouts. While distinctly different from traditional Lunarist sects, they were often clumped together by those who did not understand the intricacies of their ancient ways. Perhaps that is why a certain bandaged earth pony had opted not to send regular missionaries to speak with them, and instead brought the only pony capable of connecting to these unique thestrals: himself.\n\nArriving at the inner section of the mountain city, Good Word dismissed his small entourage and knocked on the door to an imposing moon-themed temple. He had already dispatched two would-be assassins and converted a third on his way here. There wasn't a pony devout enough in this city to stand in his way.\n\nThe door opened, revealing an elderly Moonspeaker. She squinted her eyes as she immediately recognized him through his bandages. "You've changed, young stallion. The fervent joy in your eyes has been replaced by a fearsome fire."\n\n"The fire of faith is indeed fearsome," Good Word said as he maintained eye contact with the mare. "May I come in?"\n\nThe old mare glanced down at the weapon he carried at his side. Were the shots she heard earlier his doing? "You know outsiders are forbidden from entering." She looked back up at him. His eyes... they held more than just fire. The pony in front of her was full of such absolute conviction that she no longer felt certain about the outcome of his visit. "I enjoyed our talks in the past, and I'm certain you'll try to show me the error of my ways again. That said... I suppose an exception could be made. Come inside.""

 daring_solar.35.desc:0 "---And it came to pass that a great multitude of Lodgers did gather around the site of the Grand Lodge Tabernacle upon its completion. Lo, the ponies of Stableside did prepare a great celebration, and with Celestia's blessing, the radiance of Her sun did shine especially bright that day---\n\nThe brilliance and glory of the structure before the ponies of Stableside could not be understated — it was second in beauty only to Celestia herself. Countless hours of labor and love had been poured into the Tabernacle from the finest engineers in the continent, and it showed. Exquisitely detailed depictions of Celestia and Her sun graced the many windows, with the largest design at the front showing the sun shining brightly as the moon beneath it reflected its beauty. The grand spires of the Tabernacle, numbering six in total, were adorned with the symbols of the Elements of Harmony, while atop the tallest spire was a luminous golden statue of Twilight Sparkle extending her wings and holding her front hooves up towards the sun above.\n\nThe dedication of the Tabernacle itself was given by none other than Good Word, whose reverence and respect for Celestia was unparalleled. All present to hear him speak felt a fervent joy in their hearts, as if what was transpiring here today would solidify the Lodge's status as the one true religion for ponykind, or perhaps even creaturekind.\n\nAs the dedication neared its end, Good Word raised his head one last time to address the boundless flock of faithful ponies standing before him. They looked upon him earnestly, and there were even camera operators present to broadcast and immortalize his speech throughout the country. There was no doubt in his mind that his final words would have a lasting impact on the Lodge for generations to come.\n\n"And so, as we prepare to open the Grand Lodge Tabernacle to all members of the Lodge, I beseech you to keep my words close to your heart. For this building is more than just special, it is perfect much like how Celestia is. When you walk its halls and chambers, I want you all to remember that it is...""

Normally they would accompany the prophet wherever he went, but he had seen fit to have them stand guard outside. And so, with weapons on one side and scriptures on the other, each began to pray for the safety of the stallion in their charge.\n\n"What's that, miss?" a very young thestral seemed to appear from nowhere, settling in between two of the missionaries. Several of them halted themselves mid-draw as they were caught off guard by the tiny colt's sudden appearance. Some surveyed their surroundings, evidently reminded that they would need to remain on alert. If someone so innocuous as a foal could sneak up on them, then a sinner might be able to as well.\n\nThe missionary closest to the colt saw that he was pointing to her scripture on the side of her barrel. She smiled, then retrieved the book. Any opportunity to teach the words of Celestia was a welcome one. "This is our Revised Journal of Friendship, a collection of the teachings of Celestia, Her Faithful Student, and our beloved prophet. It holds many lessons that help us find our way forward in life."\n\nThe colt tilted his head, his confusion apparent. "But my mom says the Moonspeakers help us live happily." He looked over the book as the mare lent it to him. He pointed at the symbol of the sun present on its cover. "My mom also says that sunnies are bad ponies. She says you're different sunnies but still sunnies. But you seem a lot nicer than the others."\n\nThe mare's smile became tainted by a hint of sadness, "Kindness is given to those who listen earnestly, young colt. But not everypony listens, and some even show hatred toward us because they don't understand why we do what we do." She guided his hoof over to the book and opened it to a particular page. "Take for example this passage by Twilight Sparkle: 'Sometimes, one of your best friends wants you to bond with another one of their best friends. But when you meet that friend, you realize you have nothing in common with that pony.'" The mare reached up and touched the thestral's ears, then her own to highlight their differences. "Many souls in the Empire don't like bat ponies, but we see you as equals. We're all just looking for guidance. And just as I can help show you the way..."\n\nBoth ponies looked up at the Moonspeaker's temple as they watched the entire Moonspeaker Conclave follow Good Word out the door. Every one of them was crying, and some even begged Good Word for forgiveness for their sins."

Good Word was there to meet her when she stepped outside with a long-winded apology at the ready. Unfortunately, the former Commander refused to accept it, firmly stating that he had betrayed her to serve a tyrant and that no acts of goodwill could undo the damage he had done to the culture of the Southeast. She turned to depart, but not before proclaiming that she would write another book to try to sway the minds of the masses.\n\nLife seemed to return to relative normalcy after that. Good Word couldn't help but feel a sense of worry, as if there was still an unsolved issue awaiting his attention. Then, after thoughtful prayer, he remembered the one wrong he had yet to right. He sent word to his assistants and summoned the pony he wished to speak with, and soon enough, she arrived at his office for the first time in what felt like eternity.\n\n"What do you want?" Crescent Glow spoke very bluntly. The venom in her tone was thick, but her eyes betrayed a hint of... was that despair? He couldn't tell.\n\n"I've had a lot of time to think about what has happened over the past few years," The Prophet chose his words very delicately, "and I realized that we haven't spoken in some time. I wanted to apologize to you for... damaging our friendship. I put my faith first, and in doing so, I separated myself from those closest to me." He carefully examined the thestral's response, noting that she did not seem pleased with him, then continued, "Furthermore, I realize that I have deeply hurt you, and I wanted to ask if there is anything I can do to make up for how I have wronged you."\n\nFor a brief moment, it seemed like her stern facade might break, but then she spoke with such fire that it nearly matched the heat of Daybreaker herself. "Can you undo the cultural genocide you've inflicted upon my home? What about the millions of lives you've upended and indoctrinated for your precious goddess? The same one who incinerated her sister's followers - my friends - for working their entire lives to try and earn the right to serve as the Night Guard?" She bared her teeth as she trembled. "What about my family? They disowned me for not following your beliefs. Can you fix that, too?"\n\nFor the first time in his life, Good Word was truly speechless.\n\nUpon sensing his hesitation, Crescent went in for the verbal kill. "I used to dream that we'd be together, but now I don't dream of anything at all.

But on this occasion, one thestral found herself making her way towards the decorated tombstone. It was hard to miss, even through the light of the waning crescent moon. That joke might have brought a smile to her once, but this was not a joyous affair. She had even donned her old Night Guard uniform — it was what she was wearing when they had first met, after all.\n\nSoon enough, she found what she was looking for, then retrieved a tiny emblem — that of the alicorn sisters circling one another in harmony — from her pocket and tenderly lowered it to the ground alongside the myriad of other offerings. She sniffled, wiped her tears away, then stood up, but stopped when she saw what was inscribed upon the tombstone:\n\n"IT IS EASY TO BE IN PAIN AND TO INFLICT THAT PAIN UNTO OTHERS, BUT IT IS MIRACULOUS TO BE ABLE TO TURN THAT PAIN INTO UNRELENTING KINDNESS, EVEN UNTO DEATH."\n\nCrescent sank to the ground and began to bawl. "Why? Why, why why why?!?" She pounded the ground, utterly broken-hearted. "Why didn't you listen to me?! I told you she was evil!"\n\n"He was far too lost in his beliefs to see the truth."

How did you know I would be here?"\n\n"Call it a hunch." He chuckled, "I remember the way you used to look at him, back when we were working together. I figured you might still feel that way."\n\nShe would have blushed if she had not felt so utterly drained. "I shouldn't have left him. If... If I had stayed... maybe I could have convinced him not to go to Canterlot. Maybe I could have gotten past his blind obedience to Daybreaker and shown him what she was truly like..."\n\nThe stallion stepped forward and offered a hoof to her. "Perhaps. But would you be able to live with yourself, helping those fanatics? I know I wouldn't." Crescent took his hoof, "I know we're not exactly friends, but I knew that his death would greatly affect you.

It was a huge gamble to try and sneak in a potent magical artifact that would allow Daring to escape, but the plan went about as well as it could have. No major slipups, though eventually the prison would put two and two together and realize who had aided their most valuable prisoner in escaping. Then they would all be wanted criminals.\n\n"I will admit that I do not know how to proceed from here," Caballeron said as he discarded his old government ID that he had used to gain entry to the prison, "It would seem that even if we did manage to remove Daybreaker from power — and that is a very large if — the empire she has built would collapse unceremoniously, and countless Equestrians would die from the ensuing chaos as different groups vie for power."\n\n"Yeah. And Good Word is..." Crescent looked away, her expression downcast, "He's too far gone. I used to think he might turn around, but... no." She shook her head. "His dogma has infected the entire Southeast. Even if we did find a way to remove him, everypony would hate us for it."\n\nDaring grimaced. Their options from here on out were, to put it bluntly, not ideal. "We can't just give up, though. There's always a way. Don't forget, I'm still famous around the world. If I can publish another book, that might give us the international support we need to stir anti-Daybreaker sentiments enough to undo some of the religious indoctrination here. We can try to build up resistance movements, and then... we'll see."\n\nThe earth pony and thestral solemnly nodded in agreement. A guerilla war with a non-zero chance of victory is a chance of victory nonetheless, even if it takes the rest of their lives."

"That's not our princess anymore! She literally burned some of her own ponies to death for questioning her authority! Does that sound like Celestia to you?!"\n\nHer heart sunk when the stallion and the rest of parliament seemed to hesitate before answering her. "...She was probably just defending herself against Nightmareist agents." The stallion sighed, "Commander, we're tired. We don't want to fight each other again. We're all Equestrians, even Celestia with her new... look."\n\n"I can't believe this. What happened to you all? Where are the ponies who fought so hard with me to restore harmony to the southeast?"\n\n"We haven't abandoned harmony, Commander. Harmony has just changed, and so has Celestia, or Daybreaker as she now calls herself." The stallion paused, then tried to appeal to Daring Do. "You know as well as we do that Equestria will never be the same again. But we still believe in harmony. We just need to have faith that the princess will do what is best for us."\n\n"If this is what harmony is, then I want no part of it!" Daring ripped off the emblem of Celestia's cutie mark adorning her uniform, "I'M LEAVING!"\n\nThere were audible gasps as Daring Do stormed off and slammed the door shut behind her."

You can go back to your cushy desk job, Quibble."\n\nHe scoffed, "Oh please, 'A.K.

Hence why I am here to 'assist' you so that your next book will hopefully be as good as the original trilogy."\n\nDaring Do groaned in exasperation, "Why are you so concerned with my books at a time like this?!

If you wanna help so much, then you tell me: What magical artifact can defeat an alicorn? Specifically the one in charge of raising the sun?"\n\nQuibble rolled his eyes. "Easy: The Staff of Sacanas. I read about it in one of the documentaries about the Storm King. It's supposed to be able to steal the magic of an alicorn and leave them powerless, but he never found it."\n\nDaring's ears perked up. "Wow, that was actually useful information.

This just leads to the same place where you found the Sapphire Stone!

When it became apparent that the temple was indeed the same place that Daring had found the Sapphire Stone years ago, she prepared to turn around, but Quibble insisted that they check anyways "just to be sure." And thus they found themselves scaling the stairs of the temple.\n\n"Did we really have to come here in the middle of the night? You know that nighttime adventures least triple the chances that something bad will happen to us, right?" Quibble glanced up towards the full moon and pointed to it in exasperation, "Quadruples it!"\n\nDaring sighed for perhaps the hundredth time since she'd begun this journey. "I told you already, Daybreaker needs to be stopped! For all we know, her brainwashed ponies could be after us! Who knows how much time we have until they find us?"\n\n"Why would they be looking for us, though?" Quibble complained, "I haven't done anything! And the only thing you did was quit your job!"\n\nDaring elected to ignore him as they made their way into the temple itself. To their surprise, the traps hadn't been reset despite the years between Daring's last visit and now. As they traversed the eerily silent structure, they couldn't help but feel a little bit unnerved by how little resistance they had met throughout their entire journey. Even as they reached the core of the temple, there was naught but silence to greet them.\n\nQuibble tentatively glanced at the map that he had been so critical of earlier. "It says that what we seek is 'within the shrine of the Sapphire Stone.'" He looked around at the intricate, yet neglected room. "Well, we're here and I don't see it."\n\nDaring trotted up to the pedestal that she had taken the Sapphire Stone from years ago. She carefully examined it, then noticed something odd: The frame of the pedestal seemed loose. With some effort, she hefted the top of the pedestal off, revealing a hole that extended far downwards. She glanced back and smirked at her companion. "It said 'within' the shrine, Quibble." He rolled his eyes in response.\n\nShe tied a rope to a nearby pillar and descended into the hole. As she reached the bottom, she noticed a faint, ghostly light emanating from what looked like a peculiar stone in front of her. She began to reach out towards it."

There was no up, no down, no sense of direction at all. While she was used to being in stressful situations, this was unlike anything she'd ever experienced before. "H-Hello!?"\n\nA distorted voice answered her. "Impressive work, Daring Do."\n\nShe whipped her head around but could see no source of the unnerving voice. "Who's there?! Show yourself!" Daring continued to look around, only to see a bone-chilling shadowy face with shining white holes for eyes staring at her where there wasn't one before. "Who... what are you?!"\n\nThe being seemed to chuckle. "Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can offer you. You came to me because you need help, Daring Do. I can sense it." The face swiveled around her with unnatural speed, closing in next to her ear. "What is it that that you need help with so desperately?"\n\nWhile her gut was screaming at her not to trust whatever this thing was, she decided to play along to see if she could find a way out of this ominous place. "I... I was looking for a way to turn Daybreaker back into Celestia."\n\n"Hmm..." The being retreated slightly, "That is a large need. Too large. It is beyond my power."\n\nAt that remark, Daring simply shrugged. "Hey, you asked."\n\n"But what if..." The being rose above her, "There was something else? Something... deeper than that desire? Something you have wanted since the very beginning?"\n\nDaring thought back on the past few years. Equestria had practically exploded into a cacophony of bloodshed and violence that ordinary ponies could never have comprehended. So many innocents had been forever scarred by the horrors of war. Even the alicorns had gone mad. She opened her eyes and stared at the being again. "I want peace. I want Equestria to be at peace."\n\n"I can grant you the power to do this, Daring Do." The being extended a shadowy protrusion out in front of her, "Equestria at peace. A difficult task, but it can be done. All you have to do is... Let. Me. In."\n\nDespite the sinking feeling in her heart, didn't see any other way out of this place. Against her better judgment, she grasped the being's tentacle."

She picked up an herb and placed it over her patient's nose, then gestured to the dozens of other ponies, all of which had expressions of terror frozen on their faces, laying in stretchers and makeshift beds across her improvised underground hospital. "And right now, these ponies need us."\n\nStygian shuffled his hooves around uncomfortably, "I know, it's just... you're a Pillar. If you and the others could meet up again, you could banish the Pony of Shadows into Limbo again!"\n\n"Don't you remember what happened when you were saved from the Pony of Shadows, Stygian? It wasn't us who saved you, it was the magic of friendship. And nobody knows friendship better than Twilight Sparkle and her friends. I'm sure that they'll be able to handle this. Now be a dear and fetch me some more herbs from the back, please."\n\n"If you say so..." Stygian left to head into the supply closet. He rummaged around the area, then sighed. They were running low on herbs again, which meant another excursion outside. He was searching through the last container when he heard what sounded like the shattering of wood. The shelter door! He turned to leave, but then he heard a sharp cry. All of the candles went out, plunging the hospital into absolute darkness. He pressed himself against a wall and held his breath. If Meadowbrook was in trouble...\n\n...Stygian cursed himself. He wanted to help her, but he also never wanted to see the Pony of Shadows ever again. More than anyone else, he know what that monster was capable of when it gets its hooves on somepony. He sunk down to the ground and began to sulk. What could he even hope to do against it? He didn't even know if Star Swirl had gotten his letter for help after he had gone traveling around the world to learn more about friendship."

Without delay, my shard enters the cavern. My shard moves swiftly. There are multiple paths. It selects one at random and follows it. There is a bright light in the distance. My shard moves swiftly.\n\nThe Tree is ahead. My shard spots two ponies guarding it with ground-mounted automatic weapons. They open fire. My shard moves swiftly. My shard twists and bends its form as it advances on them, avoiding most of their fire. One appendage reforms into a blade. It slices one of the weapons apart. My shard moves swiftly. It leaps at the other weapon. A mistake. The weapon lands multiple consecutive hits into my shard. It is not enough. My shard is damaged, but it regenerates almost instantaneously. My shard moves swiftly. It slices the other weapon. The two ponies draw their sidearms. My shard moves swiftly. It envelops the two ponies. They are incapacitated.

That one was... unfortunate. She never intended to kill any of them, nor anycreature else for that matter, but regrettably some accidents had occurred while others had taken their own lives before she could place them into her dark trance.

Currently, she was sitting on a rather comfy rock near an isolated farm. She figured that the Shadow was either gone or missing, since the shroud over Equestria had vanished. She'd wandered aimlessly, not sure of what to do with herself. It gave her a lot of time to reflect on some mysteries. Her experience with... using... the Shadow had given her a lot of insight on the inner workings of magic.\n\nThe Sapphire Stone in her first book wasn't magical, that much she knew. So that mysterious blue light beneath the temple must have been from the real one, and she had taken a decoy earlier. She had deduced that the Sapphire Stone allowed its user to peer into alternate planes of existence, but when not attuned properly, it might only show the places between planes...\n\n...and when she peered into Limbo, the Shadow hitched a ride with her back into the real world. Daring grimaced. If she hadn't bargained with that thing, then maybe she could have found another way to defeat Daybreaker and restore peace to Equestria. But it's too late for that now. Even if she did find a way to bring everycreature back from Limbo... she didn't have magic anymore. There was also all of the ones who... didn't make it.\n\nShe hopped off of the rock and began to walk again."

Making sure to move very carefully, she crept out of their sleeping mat so as to not wake him up. He made the cutest faces in his sleep, though she would never tell him that.\n\nShe stepped outside and was greeted by the quaint peace of her village. The occasional chirp in the jungle could be heard, though not many ponies were up and about at this early hour. Mazatl made her way over to the water basin and began her daily cleansing ritual. She hummed as she washed herself, then noticed something odd: All of the wildlife noises had gone quiet. Mazatl paused for several seconds. This wasn't just weird, it was... unnatural. She hastily climbed out of the basin and listened very carefully.\n\nSilence.\n\nA growing pit formed in her stomach as she galloped back to her village. Something was wrong, something was very wrong.\n\nMazatl noticed that the jungle was becoming darker as she sped between the vines and trees. What was going on?! The light became so dim that she could barely see more than her hoof's length in front of her. She stumbled and slipped over many obstacles, but eventually, she felt the mud bricks of her hut and felt a surge of relief flow through her as she made her way inside.\n\nShe called out for her lover, but nobody answered. Feeling that pit return, she slowly inched her way towards their sleeping mat. Her hooves met the blanket, then pushed in to feel... nothing.\n\nShe heard a bone-chilling, ghastly screech behind her.

"But then where is the sun?"\n\nEmergency lights went on all throughout the central cavern just in time for the thestrals to see a shroud of unnatural darkness billowing in from the oculus above. It encompassed the statue of Luna, then it seemed to pause. Despite the urgent protests of their parents and guardians, many young colts and fillies stayed put, far too curious about the commotion to see the danger in front of them.\n\nA pair of eyes formed in the darkness. Then another. Then a hundred. Thousands of monsters beyond their worst nightmares poured out of the darkness in every direction. Ayacachtli became a cacophony of unspeakable horror as the shadowy abominations dragged away each and every single pony they could catch into the void. Many parents leapt after their children in hopes of to saving them, only to meet the same fate.\n\nDespite the best efforts of Ayacachtli's defenders, their small arms fire seemed to have little effect on the incorporeal creatures. The bullets attracted their attention more than anything, as the things practically threw themselves at whatever pony they could find. They seemed to target any sources of light as well, further plunging the cave into a chaotic blackness occasionally pierced by the flash of a muzzle.\n\nWhen silence fell, only those who stayed hidden remained conscious."

The arrival of the Shadow had occurred without warning; by the time defenses were organized almost half of the city was swallowed by darkness and the nightmarish entities that came with it.\n\n"Why won't these things die?!" shouted Mild Breeze as she tried to gun down one of the shadow creatures rapidly approaching her position. The bullets seemed to disintegrate the creature briefly, but they weren't enough; it swiftly reformed itself and resumed its relentless march.\n\n"Mild! We have to retreat!" called out Steam Vent from a nearby fortification. He had no idea what he and his wife had gotten into when they had both volunteered to defend the city, but he knew he had to keep her safe. He would never forgive himself if he let her...\n\nShe didn't seem to hear him. "YOU WON'T TAKE MY HOME YOU MONSTERS!" she screamed as she dumped her magazine into the creature, but to no avail. The echo of the empty click rang louder than the continuous barrage of heavy weapons fire occurring throughout their defensive line. She cursed and briefly took her gaze off the creature to reload her weapon.\n\n"MILD! GET BACK NOW!" her husband shouted. But by the time she had readied her weapon again, it was too late. The almost incorporeal creature of shadow spread out its tendrils and enveloped the mare. Steam screamed in terror and swiveled his machine gun around to unload it into the beast, praying desperately that it would be enough. An unnatural howl emerged from the creature as the firepower from the machine gun seemed to be enough to destroy it. It released its grip on the mare as its shadowy form was ripped to shreds.\n\nSteam let go of his weapon and practically threw himself over the fortifications to check on his wife. First, he felt relief at seeing her chest still rising. His relief quickly melted away into horror as he saw her face: Frozen in shock, her eyes wide; it seemed like she wasn't there at all. Steam performed a basic medical check, only to discover that whatever the creature had done to her, it had rendered her comatose. He looked around in preparation to carry her to safety, but his heart sank when he saw dozens more of those same shadow creatures enveloping the rest of his defensive line. He looked back down at his wife and apologized to her, but before he could rise, another shadow was already upon him."

He shuddered as he recalled one unfortunate pony hyperventilating until their heart gave out.\n\nThis didn't bode well for his psyche, as he was barely able to run faster than the shroud that kept encroaching on the land behind him. He had only just reached Tenochtitlan barely an hour before the darkness had spread that far, giving him only a brief moment to pause and catch his breath.\n\nHow could he have been so stupid? The Sapphire Stone in the first Daring Do book wasn't magical, that much was clear... therefore, it must have been a decoy. It was obvious now that the real Sapphire Stone was still in the temple, and that it held magical powers of some kind. But what? He thought back to the traveling merchant from Saddle Arabia that Daring Do had bought the map from. The merchant's accent was rather heavy... it was possible that the language barrier resulted in them selling Daring Do a way to -find- the Staff of Sacanas rather than a map that led directly to it.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter now. Quibble glanced behind him only to see a faint, but towering shadowy monstrosity approaching in the distance. His incredibly sore legs complained at having to move again, but he had no choice. He had to get away. He had to run, for that was all anypony could do now."

She looked at the shield protecting the castle and raised her hoof up against it. Surprisingly, it passed through as if there was no barrier at all. She pressed another hoof forward, and another, and when her body was halfway through, she gasped, as if the full weight of her actions had been realized all at once. "No!" she shouted. Before she could do anything further, shadowy tendrils inched up her body and enveloped her again. "YES," said the pony, who then proceeded into the castle.\n\nThe door to the throne room burst open, and the pony was met with a wave of searing heat. "Oh, it's *you*. You, who have brought ruin upon my Empire. You, who have condemned millions of my little ponies to die. You, who dares to intrude on the place I call home? There isn't a punishment worthy for all that you have done!"\n\n"DAYBREAKER. YOU. DID. THIS." Shadowy limbs emerged from the pony's body and rushed towards the fiery alicorn. Daybreaker ignited her horn and sliced apart the shadows with ease. The pony knelt down and screamed as an unending number of tendrils manifested themselves and tried to reach for Daybreaker.\n\nAs it became clear that she could not cut the shadows faster than they appeared, the Empress of Ponykind focused her magic into a blindingly bright ball of light and threw it down at the pony. The shadow attacks ceased as it collided with the pony. "Hmph," Daybreaker smirked, "When there are no shadows left, only my glory remains."\n\n"THERE IS ALWAYS DARKNESS BEHIND LIGHT," Suddenly, Daybreaker felt dozens of tendrils wrap themselves around her. She tried to ignite her horn again, but they seemed to halt her flow of magic. Her confidence vanished instantaneously as she looked around for the source of the tendrils, only to discover that she herself was casting a shadow from her miniature sun spell. The pony emerged from that shadow. "YOU TOOK A PEACEFUL EQUESTRIA AWAY FROM ME. NOW I SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM EQUESTRIA." A small, multicolored portal opened up next to her.\n\nDaybreaker struggled against her bonds, but to no avail. She let out a muffled cry as she was dragged away into Limbo."

And yet the false goddess and her last remaining subjects were gone, as if they had never been there in the first place.\n\nWhile the Pony of Shadows found this mildly annoying, ultimately it did not matter if Nightmare Moon was captured or not. Her forces had crumbled to its might, and she would no longer pose a threat to its goal. It was curious on how she had managed to escape, though. Did she bypass the anti-teleportation spell? No, its magic was far stronger than hers.\n\nIt extended tendrils toward the concrete structure. The alicorn had to have used magic, that much was sure. But what kind? The tendrils probed the nooks and crannies, trying to sense any residual magical energy left behind.\n\nIt felt enlightenment, then frustration. The Pony of Shadows withdrew its tendrils as it pieced together what had occurred. Nightmare Moon, as false of a goddess as she was, had cast an exceedingly well-hidden illusory spell. She never entered this bunker at all, but instead had crafted an illusion as her forces were fleeing, tricking the shadow monsters into following a mere image.\n\nClever, it thought as it turned to leave the area. For any other being, an alicorn on the run might pose a serious threat. However, the Pony of Shadows had long since surpassed the power level of mere immortals. No single being on Equus was strong enough to defeat it, not alone. It pushed Nightmare Moon out of its mind, the returned its focus to the task at hoof."

The nature of these reports all shared the same ominous details: unnatural creatures would appear from the darkness, small arms fire seemed next to useless against them, and ponies defending themselves from the monsters were forced to retreat.\n\nThe situation has ponies so frightened that many are beginning to flee the Southeast in every direction, regardless of what dangers await them elsewhere.

As Daring did not expect her stories to sell very well if she marketed them as real, she opted to market them as fantastical instead under the pen name of A.K. Yearling.\n\nA fearless adventurer at heart, Daring Do has spent many years keeping powerful magical artifacts away from those who would misuse them. From the devious creature known as Ahuizotl to the greedy Doctor Caballeron, she has thwarted many foes in her quest to protect ponies from potential catastrophes. Between her escapades, she often spent time relaxing at home and adapting her latest adventure to novels.\n\nUnfortunately for Daring, her adventuring came to a screeching halt when Equestria descended into civil war. The return of Nightmare Moon frightened many ponies, so Daring opted to do what she did best: protect them. However, this time she wasn't merely working from ambiguity; instead, she fully embraced the legendary image her readers had come to know her by and is now leading them to victory.\n\nAfter all, she's a hero, and everypony knows that heroes never lose.\n\n§YPortraits By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

 CES_good_word_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: December 23, 980, Stableside, Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!: Ever since he was young, Good Word had a penchant for talking to others. Whether it was a friendly conversation or a strife-filled argument, his uncanny ability to get through to even the most distrusting ponies was as unnerving as his ever-pleasant personality. However, for most of his life, his outward happiness was merely a mask that hid his crippling anxiety. Furthermore, he had become somewhat distant from his father due to the elder stallion's preference for doing charity work rather than spending time with his son.\n\nGood Word's life began to change in 1002 after an attempt to rekindle the relationship with his father took a turn for the worse. During a relief mission alongside a small ponytarian group known as the Friendship Lodge, a damaged support beam caused the roof above Good Word's father to collapse, burying him underneath a heap of metal. The young stallion saw the speed and zeal of the Friendship Lodge firsthoof as they rescued his father, even going so far as to rush him to the hospital when they saw he was hurt.\n\nUnfortunately, the injuries Good Word's father received were terminal. As the elder stallion was dying, he apologized to his son for not being there for him, and said that the reason why he worked so hard to aid others was that "there are so many ponies who need help, and Celestia knows they need it more than we do. She would help too, but even she can't be everywhere at once."\n\nThis was the spark that altered the young stallion forever: He became filled with the same spirit of charity that his father held, and he sought to work alongside the Friendship Lodge in order to both work past his own anxiety while spreading kindness and the teachings of Celestia to all. In the years that followed, he rapidly rose through the Lodge's ranks, and it was only a few months after he became Head Lodger that Equestria descended into civil war.\n\nNow he stands ready to do what he believes Celestia would do, but some wonder if his desire to emulate the princess' actions borders on obsession, or perhaps even worship.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: PrincessRari" #Non-solarist Good Word

However, for most of his life, his outward happiness was merely a mask that hid his crippling anxiety.\n\nAs he progressed through young adulthood, Good Word found himself joining and eventually leading a ponytarian organization known as the Friendship Lodge. They helped him through his personal problems, and in turn, he channeled his passion back into the Lodge tenfold. At the dawn of the Equestrian Civil War, he sought to maintain the spirit of friendship and harmony wherever he went, but the reality of war between Equestria and the Lunarists slowly ate away at his desire to help those who now wanted to kill him.\n\nThings eventually came to a head when the once-peaceful ruler of Equestria transformed into Daybreaker. The government in Stableside had decided to throw their lot in with the empress, and as a part of that, they had invited Good Word to speak on the matter on behalf of the Friendship Lodge. That was the fateful day that Lunarist arsonists had barricaded and burnt down the capitol, killing everypony inside.\n\nBut Good Word was not just anypony. Just as Celestia was underwent a fiery rebirth, the inferno stripped away the last of his anxiety and doubts, leaving only the purity of his hope that Celestia would save him. His faith. And through that faith, he rose from the ashes of the secular government with a new, divine purpose in life: to spread that faith to all — and to convert the gentiles through any means necessary.\n\n§YPortraits By§!: Motley_ad, Bunnyshrubby, & Twotail813" #Solarist Good Word

Tales of her kindness and beauty enthralled the young mare, and so like many other thestrals, she sought to devote her life to the Princess of the Night. Unfortunately for her, the millennium since Nightmare Moon's banishment had polluted the vision of Luna held by many ponies, leading to Crescent's dismay when she learned that the Night Guard in Canterlot was merely a ceremonial role and a ridiculed one at that.\n\nStill, Crescent persevered. She sought education at Canterlot University, and then on the day of her graduation, something miraculous happened: Princess Celestia announced the return of her beloved sister, and Crescent got to see younger alicorn with her own eyes.\n\nThe joy that Princess Luna's return had brought to Crescent was matched only by her desire to remedy the Night Guard's perceived appearance as a joke. She quickly enrolled in Equestria's military, and through sheer determination, she outpaced all of her peers in Officer School.\n\nAlas, in a cruel twist of fate, shortly after she finished training, Princess Luna transformed into Nightmare Moon once more. This devastated the young mare, as she privately did not wish to serve an evil alter ego of the pony she worshipped so dearly. And so, when she was placed in charge of a portion of the New Lunar Empire's military, she and many other like-minded Lunarists defected to fight for harmony. For that's what they believe Princess Luna would have wanted.\n\n§YPortraits By§!: Egil"

Its magical abilities were unparalleled, but like any tool, it needed someone to wield it. The Umbrum desired for King Sombra to use their superweapon to transform all of Equestria into a realm that they could inhabit. But before they could set their plan in motion, a young pony named Stygian took the reins of the Pony of Shadows and was subsequently banished by the Pillars of Equestria into Limbo, a place between worlds. The Umbrum considered their weapon lost, then moved onto other machinations.\n\nA thousand years later, the Elements of Harmony brought the Pony of Shadows back into reality, but tore away its host before banishing it back into Limbo. Now it has returned yet again, though the exact method to how it did so remains a mystery.\n\nThe Pony of Shadows is not truly sapient; it warps the desires of its host in order to complete both its original purpose and the goal of the pony that wields it. Its host may not even be fully aware of their actions as they pursue their goals. Unfortunately for most ponies, that goal involves the complete and utter annihilation of society as they know it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"
