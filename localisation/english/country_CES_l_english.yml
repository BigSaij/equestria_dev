daring.1.t:0 "From Book Hero To Real Hero"
daring.1.desc:0 "Things had happened so quickly.\n\nA.K. Yearling was doing book signings in Stableside when the news broke out. Nightmare Moon had returned? A civil war had begun? In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial State was born."
daring.1.a:0 "They never did question what happened to A.K. Yearling, though."

daring.2.t:0 "Improvising"
daring.2.desc:0 ""What are your orders, Commander?"\n\nDaring Do could have sworn that she'd heard that question more times in the past few weeks than there were words in all of her books combined. She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""

daring.7.desc:0 "The second-to-last thing that Daring Do had expected when she awoke was to find a sizable army of Lunarists just outside of Stableside's city limits. The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the representative thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, former First Officer of the New Lunar Empire. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon. So that's what we're going to do.""
