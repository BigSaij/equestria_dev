# Civil War Focuses

CES_cw_1_1:0 "Daring Do and the Jungle of Disharmony"
CES_cw_1_1_desc:0 ""Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am. I still don't know what possessed me to jump up and be the hero I portray in my books. Maybe I always was and never realized it. Either way, this will definitely be my most high-stakes adventure yet.""
CES_cw_2_1:0 "Find What Weapons We Can"
CES_cw_2_1_desc:0 "This little corner of Equestria was never particularly known for its industrial capacity. Thankfully, we've managed to locate a few unattended weapons caches that seem to have been intended for Nightmare Moon's forces. We're sure that she won't mind if we borrow them."
CES_cw_2_2:0 "Request Help from the Locals"
CES_cw_2_2_desc:0 "The reality is that we are never going to defeat these crazed Lunarists if we do not have everypony united behind our backs. Daring Do has already rallied many to our cause, but we must ask for more, or we will have no hope of restoring Harmony to the southeast."
CES_cw_3_0:0 "Convert Fishing Barges"
CES_cw_3_0_desc:0 "Stableside was nowhere near the largest port in Equestria, but it did have some traffic. We're fortunate that a few fishing barges were around at the time that we were cut off from Equestria, and we're even more fortunate that their captains want to help us take back the seas."
CES_cw_3_1:0 "Prepare the Lowlands"
CES_cw_3_1_desc:0 "A direct assault into the depths of the jungles remains a difficult task. Perhaps too difficult, if our frontline reports are accurate. But what if we didn't have do all of the fighting inside of those jungles? East of Galloprey lays an open field ripe with possibilities. One such possibility is a makeshift air field, from which we can work towards taking the fight to the skies."
CES_cw_3_2:0 "The Second Bastion of Harmony"
CES_cw_3_2_desc:0 "Stableside must be the light in this darkness. But an unshaped, unguided light does not offer direction to those who need it. Daring Do may be the glue holding us together, but no one mare is capable of running a war by herself. Our Commander needs help, and that is why we must put aside our differences and fall in line so that she may guide us to victory."
CES_cw_3_3:0 "Inspire the Scared and Hopeful"
CES_cw_3_3_desc:0 ""This isn't a story anymore. We are not just fighting for our lives, but for the hopes and dreams of everypony here! We may be cut off from Equestria, but the spirit of Harmony lives within each and every one of us! We cannot fail! We must not fail! WE WILL NOT FAIL! For if we do, then Harmony itself might be lost forever.""
CES_cw_3_10:0 "Refurbish the Relics"
CES_cw_3_10_desc:0 "Of the many museums Daring Do has contributed to, only one exists in this region of Equestria. Fortunately, the Stableside Museum of Equestrian History contains a veritable abundance of weaponry. Unfortunately, they are antique weaponry. Fortunately, they have never seen use. Unfortunately, they will probably fall to pieces in the jungle. We will take what we can get, though."
CES_cw_4_0:0 "Repurpose Stableside's Ports"
CES_cw_4_0_desc:0 "The ports of Stableside are nothing if not well-used. Converting them for the war effort would be both quick and easy, though we must remember to return them to their original purpose once we have succeeded in bringing peace to this land."
CES_cw_4_1:0 "Recruit the Fisherponies"
CES_cw_4_1_desc:0 "The famed fisherponies of Stableside have been mastering the sea for generations. While it pains us to ask them to stop and aid in something they are unfamiliar with, perhaps in the future we can reform them into proper seafaring soldiers."
CES_cw_4_2:0 "The Daring Fighter Squadron"
CES_cw_4_2_desc:0 "The time is now! With the Commander's blessing, our first fighters can now take flight. The sky belongs to those who live in the light of Celestia's sun, while those who subvert harmony in the shadows below are destined to be defeated!"
CES_cw_4_3:0 "Modify the Toy Factories"
CES_cw_4_3_desc:0 "Foals' amenities are often one of the first things to be deprioritized during wartime. With great regret, we must turn their toy factories into arms factories in hopes that one day they may grow up not needing to work in those same factories."
CES_cw_4_4:0 "The Daring Infantry Regiments"
CES_cw_4_4_desc:0 "When the call came out to fight against the enemies of Harmony, few answered at first. But like a bursting dam, a huge wave of volunteers have arrived from all over to fight for Celestia, with their own weapons to boot. Now forward march and show them what we're made of!"
CES_cw_4_10:0 "Portland Center of Naval Operations"
CES_cw_4_10_desc:0 "One advantage we seem to have over our enemies is the capacity for prolonged naval logistics. Commander Daring Do has proposed that we prepare supplies in Portland to construct additional ports along the coastline so that we may easily supply our troops after taking their territory."
CES_cw_4_10_unlock_port_decision:0 "Completing this focus will grant us a decision to construct a §YNaval Base§! on the coastline of §YChinamitl§! to supply our troops if we control enough territory around there."
CES_cw_5_1:0 "Nationalize the Shipwrights"
CES_cw_5_1_desc:0 "While there are not many shipwrights within Stableside, there exists one who has the capability to churn out vessels faster than almost any other. Fortunately, the ponies running it have already agreed to help us, now it's just a matter of making their cooperation official."
CES_cw_5_2:0 "Do All That We Can And More"
CES_cw_5_2_desc:0 "Though we have given our all, our all is not enough! There can be no victory without sacrifice, and we must be willing to sacrifice every comfort of life if it means that future generations get to live in an Equestria where they don't have to sacrifice anything."
CES_cw_5_4:0 "Fix Up The Workshops"
CES_cw_5_4_desc:0 "Far too long have our arms factories been working with outdated red tape and antique equipment restricting the full capabilities of production. With the opening of our newest addition to the war effort, we can focus on bringing the rest of our factories up to code."
CES_cw_5_5:0 "Fear Not The Night"
CES_cw_5_5_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon's disciples stretch far throughout this land, but not all thestrals support her. There are those who would reject the Nightmare, not out of hate for her, but out of love for who she used to be."
CES_cw_6_1:0 "The Daring Marine Regiment"
CES_cw_6_1_desc:0 "As promised, the fisherponies are being returned to their area of expertise, albeit with lots of training and a new purpose in mind: to seize important coastal areas from those who would see Harmony thrown aside."
CES_cw_6_2:0 "Adapt To The Jungle"
CES_cw_6_2_desc:0 "The jungles surrounding Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan are treacherous and miserable to fight in. While we are loathe to use the tactics of our enemies, we must accept that we need to learn from them if we are to defeat them in their very home."
CES_cw_6_3:0 "The Art of Survival" 
CES_cw_6_3_desc:0 "Daring Do's experiences in rigorous terrains have given her an immense insight into how to survive in these areas. Together with her compatriots and associates, she will put together a manual with tips and tricks to help our troops fight in the wilds."
CES_cw_6_4:0 "Make A Little Go A Long Way"
CES_cw_6_4_desc:0 "This has been a weary conflict, but Commander Daring Do has transformed a once-scared group of ponies into a valiant fighting force. Before we would hoard resources in hopes that the war would end quickly, but now we see that this was not the way. We have to spread our resources as far as they will go in order to succeed."
CES_cw_6_5:0 "Our Reasons, Our Purposes"
CES_cw_6_5_desc:0 "Commander Daring Do is nothing if not a determined mare. Her defiant speeches seem to convey the same energy depicted in the very books bearing her name, if not more so. Even then, occasionally we must remind ourselves of what exactly we're fighting for."
CES_cw_6_6:0 "Seize the Nightmare's Tools of War"
CES_cw_6_6_desc:0 "As the war rages on, we've uncovered more and more supplies stored away by those who seemed to have been preparing for Nightmare Moon's return, as if they knew it was going to happen. While that remains a mystery for later, these supplies can be put to good use fighting against those whom they were intended for."
CES_cw_7_4:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
CES_cw_7_4_desc:0 ""For Harmony! For Equestria!" is the battle cry spearheaded by our Commander. For months we've been singing her praises, but she downplays when others call her a hero, preferring to redirect those praises back to us. For heroes are the ones that fight against the darkness. And heroes never lose."

#navy
CES_navy_1_1:0 "Formalise The ESEN"
CES_navy_1_1_desc:0 "Due to the efforts of our fledgeling navy during the war, we've chosen to support those who fought for us on the seas and have those who continue fighting with us by officially turning our small fleet into the Equestrian South Eastern Navy."
CES_navy_2_1:0 "Rebuild The Baltimare Dockyards"
CES_navy_2_1_desc:0 "Regrettably the assaults on Baltimare had caused significant damage to it's naval infrastructure, hampering naval production and maintenance for the ESEN, as well as halting most pre-war trade through the ports. By rebuilding the ports we should be able to recapture the Charm City's luster."
CES_navy_2_2:0 "Expand The Stableside Dockyards"
CES_navy_2_2_desc:0 "During the war we had grown reliant on supplies and trade through the Stableside ports, which were not built to support the amount of shipments we needed. Now we have a moment to breath we can improve and expand the facilities in the city to improve supplies, shipbuilding and trade."
CES_navy_3_1:0 "The South-Eastern Coast Guard"
CES_navy_3_1_desc:0 "Given our proximity to the Dragons and the difficulty of policing our entire coast line, it has been decided to create a Coast Guard to ensure the safety of merchants and locals across the coastal regions."
CES_navy_3_2:0 "Develop The Saltmane Dockyards"
CES_navy_3_2_desc:0 "Despite their position under Caballeron the Saltmane Dockyards managed to escape mostly undamaged, and picked up a large amount of trade from the traders who had wanted to go through Baltimare. Though this influx has stagnated, the Dockyards still serve as an important trading and logistical hub in the region and funds should be directed to aid in it's development."
CES_navy_3_3:0 "The Crown Jewel Of The Seas"
CES_navy_3_3_desc:0 "It is impossible to ignore the allure of battleships upon the sea, of the pure power they hold even in the age of the carrier.\n\nSurely, despite the heavy costs and exceedingly long construction times we could try to make our own?"
CES_navy_4_1:0 "Silent Killers"
CES_navy_4_1_desc:0 "From our research, the most cost effective way to win a naval war is careful and clever usage of submarines. They're cheap enough to produce en masse, stealthy enough to escape detection from our foes and strong enough to strangle the economies of our enemies."
CES_navy_4_2:0 "The Heart Of A Fleet"
CES_navy_4_2_desc:0 "Our planned battleships, though impressive, will be out of the picture for longer than we'd like. Thus some of our naval engineers have presented a plan for a sister series of heavy cruisers to fill the gaps until our battleships enter service."
CES_navy_5_1:0 "Our Own Cruisers"
CES_navy_5_1_desc:0 "With our forays into light ships a glaring gap between our larger and lighter projects has revealed itself. This has prompted a group of naval engineers from Baltimare to present plans for a class of light cruisers to plug this gap and ensure our naval forces are able to defend our shores."
CES_navy_5_2:0 "Learn To Adapt, Adapt To Survive"
CES_navy_5_2_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, whatever high command we've been able to assemble are still woefully unprepared for a true war on the seas. Primarily consisting of veteran fisherponies and defectors from Baltimare, they're unfortunately less than perfect for the role. A new generation of sailors and those with bright ideas on naval tactics shall be brought in to replace them."
CES_navy_5_3:0 "Experimental Carriers"
CES_navy_5_3_desc:0 "Though prohibitively expensive carriers serve a great purpose upon the seas, ensuring any assaults on far off islands would never be without air support while also being able to target enemy ships with their bombers.\nDespite our budgeters pleading for us to not pursue carriers, we can surely find a place for them in the budget. Hopefully."
CES_navy_6_1:0 "The ESEN Admiralty"
CES_navy_6_1_desc:0 "With the new waves of admirals and the constantly evolving state of naval warfare, it is no longer in our best interest to run every single aspect of the ESEN as a part of another branch of the military. By ensuring the ESEN Admiralty is independent from the other parts of the military, and establishing them in Saltmane, we can ensure our plans and battles upon the high seas are led by those who know the best."

#air
CES_air_1_1:0 "Create The SEAF"
CES_air_1_1_desc:0 "The few fighters we had during the war served us well and opened our eyes to the potential of air power in future wars. By turning the remnants of the Daring Fighter Squadron into an official South Eastern Air Force, we can support those with new ideas about air power."
CES_air_2_1:0 "Import Surplus Fighters"
CES_air_2_1_desc:0 "Despite their effectiveness, the fighters we had during the war were not limitless. We've only got a shell of the former number we had when the DFS was established, and even then they're of limited use in dogfights given their lack of maintenance. To bolster our forces we should purchase older models of foreign fighters."
CES_air_2_2:0 "Import Outdated Bombers"
CES_air_2_2_desc:0 "As nice as it would be to procure a fleet of modern bombers, our situation does not allow us to afford such an expense at the minute. For now efforts shall be made to purchase usable, but dated, foreign bomber designs to fill the ranks. Hopefully this should allow Heavy Wings time and inspiration to develop their own line of bombers."
CES_air_3_1:0 "The Vanilla Comet"
CES_air_3_1_desc:0 "In recent years Equestria has focused on the spitfire project, which we've been unable to access to due to communication being cut. Luckily Vanilla Clouds spent their time during the war developing their own fighter. By providing funding we should be able to help them finish it for our own usage."
CES_air_3_2:0 "Establish Actual Airfields"
CES_air_3_2_desc:0 "Our current airfields are lacking, mostly cleared dirt runways with a few caves here and there out of desperation. With the situation more stable, we can construct actual facilities across the country to ensure we can use our new planes rather than end up with them stuck up a tree or halfway through a cave."
CES_air_3_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Saltmane"
CES_air_3_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings, a Baltimare firm focused on the design of twin engine bombers, have offered up a fleet of naval bombers which were to be shipped to Equestria shortly before the civil war began.\n\nSince they've been sitting in stockpile we'd be able to get them for a small fee to complement our air force."
CES_air_4_1:0 "Standardize SEAF Training"
CES_air_4_1_desc:0 "Though our current pilots are veterans of the war and hopeful recruits, they're not going to last. We should take advantage of their experience while we still have access to them, and get them to act as teachers for new recruits in the expanding SEAF. By having teachers with recent experience, we can get a leg up on the ever changing world of military aviation."
CES_air_4_2:0 "Support Heavy Wings"
CES_air_4_2_desc:0 "Given their lack of buyers recently, Heavy Wings have fallen on hard times. If we were to give them funding to get back on their feet, in exchange for some of their designers, then they should be able to stand with us when we need them."
CES_air_5_1:0 "The Vanilla Mosquito"
CES_air_5_1_desc:0 "After the success of the Vanilla Comet, Vanilla Clouds has come up with a new design for a CAS role. Designed to bomb light targets while the Comet focuses on distracting enemy fighters, it should ensure our troops are able to punch far above their own weight."
CES_air_5_2:0 "Night Fighter Squadrons"
CES_air_5_2_desc:0 "There exists a type of fighting mostly ignored by other countries, that of using the night as you would any other weapon in your arsenal. By having planes painted dark to blend in with the night's sky, and pilots trained with the night in mind, we can ensure our enemy fears us no matter the hour!"
CES_air_5_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Baltimare"
CES_air_5_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings have unveiled a new project, one that truly lives up to their name. The Heavy Wings Baltimare promises to fly like a rock, handle like a bull and carry enough explosives to level a town. Despite some reservations, it isn't the most far fetched idea for an aircraft they've delivered and with a few fixes it could be used to great effect."
CES_air_6_1:0 "Through Adversity To The Stars"
CES_air_6_1_desc:0 "Throughout the SEAF a new feeling has emerged, that of pride. Of their craft, of the skies they fight in and of their fellow airponies.\nThought of as an extension of the airponies closeness to the skies, this pride propels them to go further than they thought they could.\nTo push them high enough arrive at the very stars themselves."

daring.1.t:0 "From Book Hero To Real Hero"
daring.1.desc:0 "Things had happened so quickly.\n\nA.K. Yearling was doing book signings in Stableside when the news broke out. Nightmare Moon had returned? A civil war had begun? In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial Resistance was born."
daring.1.a:0 "They never did question what happened to A.K. Yearling, though."

daring.2.t:0 "Improvising A War"
daring.2.desc:0 ""What are your orders, Commander?"\n\nDaring Do could have sworn that she'd heard that question more times in the past few weeks than there were words in all of her books combined. She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""

It was fitting, all things considered, that the last of the Lunarist forces laid down their weapons and surrendered at the break of dawn.\n\nWhile they have shown us nothing but hatred in recent times, we must be better than them. We are Equestrians, and so are they, even if they don't see it that way. Provided that our former enemies do not betray our kindness, they will be treated the same way that everypony should be: as a friend."

daring.4.t:0 "Helping Hooves"
daring.4.desc:0 "It was not every day that a "fictional" adventurer who writes books about herself under a secret identity ends up leading an army of ragtag freedom fighters against fanatical Nightmare Moon cultists, bloodthirsty mercenaries, and worst of all, socialists. Not to mention that a certain loudmouth kept following her into active war zones just to complain about how the "original trilogy's Daring Do" would have handled things differently. Quibble Pants was his name, right?\n\n"...and on page 137 of Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone, it CLEARLY STATES that quote: 'Daring Do would never intentionally place herself or others in danger!' Furthermore..." On and on he went, ranting about the tiniest details.\n\n"Everypony's a critic..." She muttered under her breath. Fortunately, help arrived in the form of two ponies that recently assisted her in organizing her forces. The former was a young, neatly dressed stallion by the name of Good Word, the latter a... generously sized, middle-aged stallion adorned with dress-like attire traditionally worn by the natives of the Equestrian Southeast. Chief Maita, she recalled.\n\n"Ah, Commander Do! It is good that you are here!" exclaimed Chief Maita, paying no heed to the odd earth pony rambling on behind her. He approached Daring Do and scooped her up in an enormous embrace that caught her off guard, "I have gathered all members of my tribe as requested! And several neighboring ones as well! They will join the fight under your banner."\n\nDaring struggled to breathe. "Good... to see... you too... Stop hugging!"\n\nAs Chief Maita released her, Good Word trotted up to her with an enthusiastic smile. "Greetings Commander Daring. You will be pleased to know that you have the full support of the Friendship Lodge, as well as a non-insignificant number of ponies in the towns where we have established Lodges. Your message of fighting for harmony is being spread far and wide... well, as far and wide as it can reasonably go without long-distance communication."\n\nThis was progressing better than she anticipated. "Thank you both. Please ensure that any new recruits get at least some basic training before they're sent to fight. And it's just Daring Do." She nodded, then excused herself to try to escape Quibble's unending criticisms.\n\nGood Word and Chief Maita exchanged glances. "She is commanding us though, isn't she?" Both shrugged."
daring.4.a:0 ""Right away, Commander!""

daring.5.t:0 "A Day At The Ranges" #Sentry
daring.5.desc:0 "Daring Do peered over her clipboard at the training area before her. She had her reservations when the plans were made, but seeing ponies determinedly train even with the limited equipment they had been given was enough to assuage them. Even now dozens of ponies flitted through the air, performed basic drills, and trained at the firing range.\n\nWandering across the courtyard, Daring couldn’t help but start listening to the overlapping conversations around her from the raw recruits. Those brave souls who stood for harmony talked of home and of hope. She smiled, before hearing some wondering where their friends who’d signed up before them had gone.\n\nDaring picked up the pace.\n\nHer thoughts were thrown aside as she heard a deafening crack from the firing range, followed by a string of expletives. Moving towards the range, Daring could see a mare struggling with an anti-tank rifle almost as large as she was. “Oh come on! I just got this stupid thing fixed...”\n\nTrotting over, Daring noticed the look in the mare’s eyes. As they readied another shot, Daring decocked the rifle, causing the mare to look up at her in surprise. “This thing’s been seeing far more action in the past few months than it’s seen in years, I’m not surprised it’s being grouchy.” Daring said as she patted the weapon.\n\n“I can understand that but it’s just-” The mare sighed. “I’m going to be relying on it soon enough, and I can’t afford it breaking when I need it. If it does then...”\n\nThe unspoken statement hung in the air for a moment as Daring softened her gaze. “I’ve found, throughout the years, that the least reliable weapon will always end up working when the moment is critical. All it takes is the courage to trust your weapon to the end.”\n\nThe mare gulped and looked at the rifle. “What if I don’t have that courage?” Daring smiled."
daring.5.a:0 "“You’re here, aren’t you?”"

daring.6.t:0 "At Your Service, Commander" #Sentry
daring.6.desc:0 "After finalising the agreements with the Stableside Tradition Co, Daring Do decided to take a walk across the Stableside docks. The refreshing scent of the ocean filled the air as Daring's gaze settled on a dock where a damaged destroyer was being tended to.\n\nThe ship was worked on by a strangely efficient team composed of pegasi and the occasional griffon, while a tall, blue unicorn mare passing up materials and giving orders. Getting closer, Daring noted just how focused the unicorn was on her team. Daring had even made it directly behind the mare without her even taking her eyes off the materials she was passing up.\n\nEventually, Daring spoke up. “Seems like ha-” Her unexpected voice startled the mare, causing her to lose control of the metal sheet she was passing up. In a split second Daring dived forward, tackling the mare to get both of them out of the way.\n\nAs the dust settled, the mare winced and opened her eyes. "Ow... Why'd you—Wait, C-Commander Daring?" She blinked in recognition, shakily standing and extending a hoof to Daring. “I-I’m Azure Bliss, the ‘new’ captain of this ship. To what do I owe the pleasure?”\n\nDaring took the hoof and steadily stood back up, brushing herself off as she did so. “I needed some fresh air after a stuffy meeting. Anyways, what’s going on with this ship? I thought the scheduled maintenance ended a month ago?”\n\nAzure rubbed the back of her neck guiltily. “Well, the last patrol did a number to the front of the ship and the l-last captain. We brought the ship back for repairs, but after looking at the damage I figured that maybe a bit more armour wouldn’t hurt much, a-and-”\n\nDaring examined the additions. It sure as Celestia wasn’t perfect, but considering they were made out of spare metal, haphazard welds and some hopes, it looked to be surprisingly sturdy. Daring couldn’t really tell more than that, since her expertise in adventuring equipment didn’t cover warships. She’d have to ask a naval officer, which the resistance was still sorely lacking.\n\nWait a minute... Zoning back in, Daring looked at the rambling mare. She...didn’t exactly have many, if any, other options for naval officers, since any admiral worth their saltlick in the south east had either thrown their lot in with Baltimare or ran north to serve Celestia. They didn’t need a perfect pony for the job, just someone to hold the fort until the war was over or somepony more qualified came along. Ultimately, Daring shrugged, a decision forming in her mind."
daring.6.a:0 "Eh, she’ll do."

daring.7.t:0 "A Surprise, To Be Sure"
daring.7.desc:0 "The second-to-last thing that Daring Do had expected when she awoke was to find a sizable army of Lunarists just outside of her frontline outpost. The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the relatively young thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, First Officer of the New Lunar Empire's southeastern theatre. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon. So that's what we're going to do.""
daring.7.a:0 "But a very, very welcome one."

daring.8.t:0 "What We're Fighting For"
daring.8.desc:0 "It was unusual that Daring Do managed to find time to sit down and speak with her general staff nowadays, though today was an exceptionally rare occurrence in that all of her most helpful advisors were together in one place. This presented an opportunity that she couldn't afford to pass up. She summoned Good Word, Chief Maita, and Crescent Glow into her tent.\n\nThe four of them shuffled in, three of whom were wondering what the matter was. "What are you all fighting for?" Daring began, "I want to know your personal reasons, all of you."\n\nWithout hesitation, Good Word spoke up first. "I believe that Celestia will protect us so long as we have faith in her. She has watched over us for as long as Equestria has existed, and she will continue to do so as long as we follow her teachings and strive to be like her most faithful student. For these reasons, I fight in her name." His overly enthusiastic praise of Celestia garnered some raised eyebrows, but no one commented on it.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, Crescent Glow took a deep breath and said, "You've already heard my reasons, Commander, but... I think I have another reason now. Before she became Nightmare Moon again, Princess Luna spoke highly of her sister and the Elements of Harmony. Of how they once helped her in her darkest hour. It's my hope that we'll be able to bring them all together again so that they can return her to normal, hopefully for good. That is what I'm fighting for."\n\nChief Maita nodded at the thestral's insightful comment. As all eyes laid on him, he simply shrugged. "War is too noisy, too bloody. That means I must keep the foals at home. I fight so that the foals may safely play outside without disturbing my sleep."\n\nDaring stifled a chuckle, then picked up a pen. "These reasons and more are why we will win. Do you all mind if I put your words into propaganda?" Her advisors shook their heads, "Great! Once we secure control of the Southeast, we can reestablish contact with Equestria to help Celestia, help Luna, and most importantly, get some well-needed rest!""
daring.8.a:0 "Diverse our exact reasons may be, but Harmony must be fought for."

daring.9.t:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
daring.9.desc:0 "What was once a makeshift headquarters had rapidly grown into an organized war machine over the past few months. A few ponies putting together supplies was now a full logistics network; a few dozen partisans listening to Daring Do's requests were now a legion of freshly-trained soldiers awaiting their Commander's orders.\n\nRaising her megaphone, Daring addressed the troops standing before her. "When we began this fight, we were just a disorganized group of scared ponies," She paused, looking out at all of the ponies who had volunteered for her cause, "But now we're much more than that! I don't see disorganized partisans, I see a full rebellion against disharmony! I don't see scared ponies, I see determined crusaders! I don't see Nightmare Moon's subjects, I see Equestrians!"\n\nThe crowd stomped their hooves and cheered as Daring Do briefly lowered her megaphone. She was surprised at how motivational speeches came naturally to her. A lot of time spent writing captivating phrases in her books seemed to help out in this regard. Maybe she really was cut out for this whole "heroic figure" thing. That thought caused her eyes to light up and her megaphone to be raised again. "There's a word for ponies who fight for a good cause against a superior foe. The moment we decided to not accept disharmony, we became that which we tell our foals about at night: Heroes. And you know we also tell them? That HEROES NEVER LOSE!""

Until then, the Commander must address the increasingly noticeable lack of an actual governing body in the Southeast."

Namely, converting Stableside's city hall into a building capable of governing the entire region. It was here that two of the Commander's advisors found themselves setting up desks and furniture when one of them broke the silence, "Why do some other thestrals call you a 'Celestian?'" \n\nThe question, though innocent in nature, seemed to pierce the humble earth pony. Good Word's ever-cheerful demeanor seemed to falter momentarily. "I believe it is a derogatory term used for ponies who are as... enthusiastic about Celestia as myself. You grew up in Ayacachtli, didn't you? I figured you would know."\n\nCrescent Glow nodded, turning to help her companion move a table. "Well, I was kind of sheltered growing up. I was never allowed to leave the caves as a filly," She chuckled nervously, "The first time I met ponies from the other tribes was when my parents let me go to Canterlot University."\n\n"I've always wanted to see both of those places," Good Word sighed as they hefted the table to the other side of the room, "Just last year, I foolishly tried to preach the lessons of Celestia and her faithful student to the thestrals near Ayacachtli. They never let me into the city as you can imagine. I am curious, though: Is it true that there's a giant statue of Princess Luna in the central region of the cavern?"\n\n"Yeah. I actually got to see her, you know? I'll never forget it... and..." Crescent stopped. Her breathing became shaky. \n\nGood Word noticed the thestral's crumbling expression and trotted over to her. "You miss her, don't you?" Crescent nodded, trying to hide her sniffling. Good Word offered her a comforting hoof, "Hey, don't cry. Maybe there's a way we can bring her back. The Elements of Harmony did it before."\n\nCrescent gently brushed aside his hoof, "I also got to see Celestia, too. I'm not sure how, but I could tell that she had suffered while Luna was gone. I then realized that the Sun and the Moon must live together in harmony. One isn't more important than the other."\n\nThe earth pony raised an eyebrow, "I know that my preference for Celestia is obvious, but I don't discount that Luna is also important.

"Daybreaker" and the "Solar Empire" were the new reality that we lived in.\n\nThis realization set in perhaps the most heated argument in Equestrian history: Whether to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia or to instead refuse to bow down to this twisted version of the princess of the sun.\n\nNotably, the ponies of the Friendship Lodge refused to take an official stance on the matter, though any outside observer could clearly tell that the organization was on the verge of undergoing a violent schism due to their almost fanatical belief in Celestia as a deity.

While she was a devout follower of Princess Luna, she vehemently rejected Nightmare Moon, claiming that her entire people were fed poisonous beliefs for generations, and has similarly claimed that "Lunarism" is not inherently opposed to harmony.\n\nHailing from the Hidden Tribes, Chief Maita had become a surprising addition to the race. His extremely charismatic and laid-back nature had earned him a large following. Some of his support can be tied to many of the recreational and conservational policies that he wished to implement for the native populations, but mostly because of how matter-of-fact his views were: He just wants everypony's foals to grow up in a safe place.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking turn of events was the final candidate: a certain Doctor Caballeron, who seemed to have ridden his status as a "villain and rival" to Daring Do to great effect, as many fans of the Daring Do books secretly liked him more than the titular adventurer! No doubt the Commander would have a word to say about this if he were to win, especially considering that he had fought against us in the war!\n\nThe results were very close, but in the end, only one candidate had earned enough votes to become President..."

I do not make this decision lightly, but I must be honest with you all: I need a break. I haven't had a full night's rest since the civil war began.

To that end, we will try to establish ourselves internationally as the true successor of Equestria so that we can get the help we need to reunite our war-torn nation.

Countless words lined the page, highlighting the key differences between the Lunarists and Nightmareists. Tomorrow, she would bring this before her citizens in hopes that ignorance would no longer remain prevalent in the Equestrian Southeast. At least in government writing, she and her followers would be separate from Nightmare Moon’s terror, and Chiropterrans would be alienated from the Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe pony spun her chair to the side and gazed out the window. Not a single living creature walked through the streets, and the buildings along the road emanated pure darkness from their windows. Crescent Glow raised the window, letting in the sound of the buzzing street lights and the subtle symphony of crickets. She momentarily closed her eyes and felt the embrace of the night breeze, then tilted her neck up and looked up. A full moon accompanied by a sea of stars floated before her, illuminating the sleeping city below.\n\nCrescent looked at an dimly lit picture of the former princess on her desk. "Why did you do it, my Princess?" she asked, "Why did you allow the Nightmare to take over?"\n\nShe felt tears well up in her eyes as she grit her teeth. She put her hooves together and closed her eyes. "Please come back, Princess Luna. Please, please, please," she begged, hoping her Princess would hear her words. She squeezed her hooves harder and harder until the point the appendages touched became numb. Her eyelids clamped even tighter. Her prayer, even louder.\n\nBut time passed, and no miracle occurred. Crescent opened her eyelids and looked at her hooves as they regained color. Would Luna even hear her words? Was she even conscious within the Nightmare?\n\nThe mare sighed and wiped her eyes. Though she no longer had her Princess, at least Celestia was still here. She was warm and kind, even if she didn’t represent the bat ponies. Crescent chuckled as she felt a little jealous towards Good Word.\n\n"Enough of that, Crescent. You’re better than that," she muttered to herself.

daring_harmony.17.desc_harmony:0 "Jungle Trek was bored.\n\nIt had been a reoccuring issue as of late. Usually boredom was a very rare instance in the life of a mercenary, but ever since the fall of Aztlan he hadn't exactly been doing much of that either. The loss stung particularly hard for him; despite knowing the jungles like the back of his hoof, it hadn't changed a thing. He had been thrown in prison along with the rest for treason against Equestria.\n\nAt least it hadn't been the communists or the Lunarists that had won, though. Jungle and many others were surprised to find themselves released soon after the war was over, likely as a result of their former employer switching sides. Many had fled, taking up new jobs overseas at the first opportunity, but not Jungle. He and a few others had stuck around, with nowhere else to go. Not that there was much to do at home, though, considering that not many were hiring for illiterate mercenaries.\n\nOr at least, that was what he had thought. An old friend of his had stopped by a few days ago and told him about an offer the government was making. They wanted him - all of them back, to serve in their new army. He would even get a position as an officer, just like back in Aztlan.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, sure. Jungle was positive that there would be plenty of boring staff meetings, irritating superiors, and a smaller bit count. He'd be part of a real army, serving a real nation instead of himself. It would be the end of his mercenary days for good.\n\nBut when all he had left was more of the same old boring days?\n\nHe'd gladly take the alternative."
daring_harmony.17.t_resistance:0 "Moral Responsibilities"
daring_harmony.17.desc_resistance:0 "Jungle Trek, as befitting his name, did not like the urban Equestrian cities very much. He far preferred the deep jungles, places away from civilization and modernity. Even places like Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan catered to him more than the artificial nature of Stableside and Baltimare.\n\nUnfortunately, Stableside was where he was needed, and thus it was where he would go.\n\nIt was a no-brainer when he got the offer from the government. A place back in the army as a general, with all the benefits it would bring? At the very least, it was certainly better than sitting around doing nothing as a self-proclaimed mercenary.\n\nIn reality, there were deeper motivations than just boredom, though. Jungle couldn't imagine Equestria, his real home, falling. It was like harmony itself was gone, clinging to life here in the forgotten jungles. Could he really still call himself an Equestrian if he didn't do something to help out? He still had a moral compass, after all.\n\nAnd plus, it was much better than the alternative. Jungle had already gotten pardoned once; he was fairly certain it wouldn't happen again.\n\nWith a deep breath, he walked into the looming administrative office, putting on the best aura of confidence he had left. "Hi," he said to the secretary, "I'm here about that position in the army I was offered a few days ago?""
daring_harmony.17.t_solar:0 "Do What You Can"
daring_harmony.17.desc_solar:0 "Jungle Trek, mercenary extraordinaire and former general of Aztlan, was confused.\n\nThis was not exactly a rare occurrence, especially as of late. Jungle did not trust the new Celestia, despite what the government said about her. A dark turn had overtaken Equestria, that was for certain. Ponies were scared, and the worst part is that here, they were not sure what to be scared of.\n\nNothing had happened... yet. There had been no purge, no great cleansing in the name of the sun as some of Jungle's collegues had assumed. He was sure that he was still on a list somewhere; treason against Equestria is not forgotten so easily. But instead of being imprisoned or executed, the government was offering him a job. A position in the army, for a generous pay.\n\nWhy did they want him? Were they testing his loyalty? Would he have to order terrible crimes on their behalf? At first, he wanted to throw the offer away and push it out of his mind, but things were never that simple. If it was not him, it would just be somepony else who may not care as much as he did. At least if he took the offer, he could try to make a real difference where it mattered.\n\nAnd if they ever showed the darker side that everypony feared... well, Jungle Trek just hoped that it wouldn't come to that."

#Solar events
daring_solar.1.t:0 "Faith Made Manifest" #loads solar focus tree
daring_solar.1.desc:0 "Following the burning of the capitol building, the members of parliament who had escaped the fire congregated in one of the Friendship Lodge's nearby lodges in order to address both that situation and to figure out how to proceed with integration into the recently sanctified Solar Empire. Due in part to the large number of Friendship Lodge members that now made up most of the government, both of these issues fell to the wayside the moment the topic of Celestia's transformation came up.\n\n"Celestia is perfect! We should strive to be like her, no matter what form she takes!"\n\n"I don't know, something about this Daybreaker makes me shiver. She doesn't feel like the Celestia we know and love."\n\nThe debate soon turned into a heated argument, then into a shouting match just short of a brawl as ponies began to take sides. Accusations of treachery and conspiracy were flung back and forth; it seemed like a schism in the Friendship Lodge would have formed right then and there were it not for a new arrival whose entrance shocked all present into reverent silence.\n\n"Brothers and sisters," the earth pony practically slammed the door shut behind him, "This is unbecoming of Celestia's most faithful," Covered in bandages from head to hoof, the once ever-cheerful Good Word now seemed to emit an aura of righteous fervor as he made his way to the podium. "Do you not remember our first statute? 'Thou shalt love Celestia with all thy heart, all thy might, mind, and strength, and in Her name we shall serve Her until our last breath.'"\n\nHis voice carried a commanding tone that washed away the doubts of most of the ponies present. Still, a few were still unconvinced. "But what if Celestia's transformation is akin to Luna's? This doesn't feel right!"\n\nGood Word's gaze seemed to bore into their very souls. "Need I also remind you of one of the most important lessons in the Friendship Journal? 'Never judge a book by its cover. And a good friend, like a good book, will last forever.' Celestia may look different, but it is still Her. She will always protect us, so long as we are faithful to Her." He pointed to the exit, "If you disagree with anything that I have said, then I invite you to resign immediately."\n\nThe ponies present looked at each other, but this time with comfort instead of frustration now that their president sounded more like a prophet."
daring_solar.1.a:0 ""Excellent. Now then, the matter of our integration into the Solar Empire...""

daring_solar.2.t:0 "Prophet, Seer, Revelator"
daring_solar.2.desc:0 "While previously the Friendship Lodge was always a loosely connected ponytarian network devoted to preaching about Celestia, the advent of her transformation combined with the spiritual rebirth of Good Word seemed to trigger a sudden change in the entire organization. Gone were any doubts about Celestia's status as a divine figure. Good Word had rapidly become a rallying leader even more so than Daring Do was, for how could he have survived such an inferno if he was not personally blessed by Celestia?\n\nAs news of Good Word's survival spread throughout the southeast, the Friendship Lodge's membership had practically skyrocketed. Almost a hundred thousand ponies from all walks of life had signed up just within a week; some because they believed that Celestia could do no wrong, while others saw the "Burned Stallion" as a sorely needed voice to guide them in these tumultuous times.\n\nAnd guide them he would.\n\nThe first changes were subtle: A few Lodge-aligned amendments were made to the fledgling republic's constitution. Funds were set aside to construct additional Lodges. Less devout members of parliament were replaced with more fervent ones.\n\nTo any outside observer, especially the most devout Lunarists in Ayacachtli, it looked like the beginnings of a cult takeover. They began to take measures to protect themselves from being purged, but no attempt at removing the thestrals ever came. The missionaries from the Friendship Lodge continued to make their humble journeys to proselytize, the only difference being a spark in their eyes that wasn't there before. They spoke of Good Word almost as if he was equal in status to Twilight Sparkle, if not more so. As if Celestia had personally granted him that status."
daring_solar.2.a:0 "They called him "Her Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.""

daring_solar.3.t:0 "The Sparks of Religion"
daring_solar.3.desc:0 "Outside of government affairs, the changes were gradual. More and more ponies attended Friendship Lodge services. Ponies already spoke highly of Celestia, but now they made snide remarks to those who did not praise her. Phrases such as "We love Celestia" became "We worship Celestia."\n\nLunarist remnants became worried. What was going on? Many of them were terrified that something big was about to happen, especially as the weeks went on, but nopony had come for them yet. Still, they continued to turn away the Friendship Lodge's missionaries, nonviolently of course, in hopes that they would be left alone.\n\nStrangely enough, despite all of the official missives coming in from the Solar Empire, the ponies of the southeast did not refer to the Goddess as Daybreaker, instead choosing to continue calling her Celestia. Their reasons varied, though the most consistent answers given were as thus: "Celestia will always be our Goddess, no matter what form she takes."\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all was the number of Lodges that had appeared in the wake of Good Word's return. Before they had scattered the land with only a few in each major city, now there were dozens in almost every town, with some even having over a hundred. The weekly services of the Friendship Lodge saw more and more ponies adopting their beliefs, with some places having so many attending these services that businesses were forced to close on those days."

BURN THE BATS! Burn the..." The courtroom session was interrupted by one mare in the crowd. It was clear by her enthusiastic chant and sudden halting of it that she expected others to join in with her. From the frightened glances of the chained thestrals to the concerned expression of the jury, all eyes were on her.\n\n"This is not the faith that we teach," Good Word stood from the seat where he was overseeing the verdict. His gaze seemed to bore holes into the mare. "While the sinners on trial today have committed heinous crimes against myself and our Goddess, they are only that: sinners. Are thestrals inherently sinners? If you believe the answer to that is anything but no, then I weep for you. I weep for you as I weep for those who reject Celestia's light."\n\nThe mare seemed to backpedal a bit. "Well, I didn't mean it like that, but come on, they're bats! You know they're never going to-"\n\nThe sound of a gunshot pierced the ears of all in the courtroom. There were brief gasps of shock as all present realized that Good Word had just executed the mare.\n\nRaising his pistol into the air, Good Word addressed all of the ponies before him, "Heed my words: That mare held a deep-seated hatred for all thestrals within her. It clouded her judgment and would have led to unjustified acts of violence against bat ponies. Let it be known that all are equal in the eyes of the Goddess, regardless of heritage, regardless of status, and regardless of race." He set his pistol down, then returned to his seat. "If any other members of the Friendship Lodge hold similar sentiments to this heretic, know they shall suffer the same fate."\n\nNaught but silence followed his statement. With a nod, Good Word turned to address the thestrals who had trapped him inside of his burning office, "'Guilty on all charges', was it? Perhaps punishment is in order for you all...""

In desperation, she had broke a window and climbed out of it, suffering only minor cuts in her escape.\n\nAfter exiting the building, the janitor met with emergency services that had just begun to arrive on the scene. They had asked if anypony else was inside of the now blazing building, only to be met with a scared nod. She had said that President Good Word was working late along with some other aides on drafting an important document, but she did not see him during her escape. She had only seen a few thestrals fleeing the scene after nailing boards to a door.\n\nWhile some firefighting pegasi had tried to bring over a storm cloud, other ground-bound firefighters did their best to save as many as they could. Just as they had finished making preparations to head inside and look for the president, the entire building collapsed in on itself."

We were thus forced to apprehend her. She denied any involvement in the burning of the capitol, but her comments alone warrant keeping her in custody for now.\n\nFollowing the capture of the Commander, we received a missive from the Solar Empire congratulating us on "doing the right thing" in regards to not allowing dissent from anyone, including our leaders. Additionally, the Empress issued a statement recognizing Quibble Pants' devotion to "rooting out heretics" and awarded him a medal for his efforts."

Clearly, none wanted to speak out against the mare who had fought so hard to get them to where they are now.\n\n"Well," One stallion resigned himself by standing up, "With due respect Commander, we can't go against the princess after all that she's done for Equestria."\n\nDaring stomped her hoof in frustration. "That's not our princess anymore! She literally burned some of her own ponies to death for questioning her authority! Does that sound like Celestia to you?!"\n\nHer heart sunk when the stallion and the rest of parliament seemed to hesitate before answering her. "...She was probably just defending herself against Nightmareist agents." The stallion sighed, "Commander, we're tired. We don't want to fight each other again. We're all Equestrians, even Celestia with her new... look."\n\n"I can't believe this. What happened to you all? Where are the ponies who fought so hard with me to restore harmony to the southeast?"\n\n"We haven't abandoned harmony, Commander. Harmony has just changed, and so has Celestia, or Daybreaker as she now calls herself." The stallion paused, then tried to appeal to Daring Do. "You know as well as we do that Equestria will never be the same again. But we still believe in harmony. We just need to have faith that the princess will do what is best for us."\n\n"If this is what harmony is, then I want no part of it!" Daring ripped off the emblem of Celestia's cutie mark adorning her uniform, "I'M LEAVING!"\n\nThere were audible gasps as Daring Do stormed off and slammed the door shut behind her."

How ironic was it that the only pony who followed her was the one that she liked the least?\n\nQuibble Pants just about collapsed as he finally caught up with her. "You gotta... stop moving... so fast..." He haphazardly reached for his canteen and gulped down the entire thing, then wiped the sweat from his brow, "So... where are we going precisely?"\n\n"There is no 'we', I was going to look for something to stop Daybreaker. You can go back to your cushy desk job, Quibble."\n\nHe scoffed, "Oh please, 'A.K. Yearling', ever since 'Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers', the quality of your adventures have fallen off of, well, a tower. Hence why I am here to 'assist' you so that your next book will hopefully be as good as the original trilogy."\n\nDaring Do groaned in exasperation, "Why are you so concerned with my books at a time like this?! Both of the princesses have gone insane!"\n\n"I don't pay attention to politics."\n\nShe resisted the urge to throw a stick at him. "You know what? Fine. If you wanna help so much, then you tell me: What magical artifact can defeat an alicorn? Specifically the one in charge of raising the sun?"\n\nQuibble rolled his eyes. "Easy: The Staff of Sacanas. I read about it in one of the documentaries about the Storm King. It's supposed to be able to steal the magic of the alicorn and leave them powerless, but he never found it."\n\nDaring's ears perked up. "Wow, that was actually useful information. Where is it?"\n\n"I don't know, he never found it."\n\nShe threw a stick at him."

The design is overly complex, the instructions needlessly cryptic, and worst of all, it-"\n\n"Just give it here!" Daring Do swiped the map away from his hooves and looked over it. "Hmm... the map says that the temple which houses the staff is located somewhere north of Tenochtitlan." She scratched her muzzle, "That's odd, I thought I'd already explored all of the temples in that area..."\n\n"As I was saying," Quibble swiped the map back, "It's completely useless. This just leads to the same place where you found the Sapphire Stone! Which, mind you, is still your best book."\n\nDaring grumbled as she yanked the scroll away again and rolled it up, "Do you have anything better to complain about than the quality of my books?!"\n\n"Well, for starters, the-"\n\n"That was a rhetorical question!"\n\nQuibble narrowed his eyes, then shrugged. "Fine. I guess we'll do things your way. Because your way no doubt includes traversing several dangerous parts of the jungle, evading lots of traps, solving puzzles, and countless other wastes of our time in search of a place you've already been to."\n\nAfter a moment of indecision, Daring grit her teeth and swallowed her pride.

daring_shadow.5.desc:0 "Daring Do opened her eyes. She felt like she was floating in an infinite black void. She looked around and saw absolutely nothing. There was no up, no down, no sense of direction at all. While she was used to being in stressful situations, this was unlike anything she'd ever experienced before. "H-Hello!?"\n\nA distorted voice answered her. "Impressive work, Daring Do."\n\nShe whipped her head around but could see no source of the unnerving voice. "Who's there?! Show yourself!" Daring continued to look around, only to see a bone-chilling shadowy face with shining white holes for eyes staring at her where there wasn't one before. "Who... what are you?!"\n\nThe being seemed to chuckle. "Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can offer you. You came to me because you need help, Daring Do. I can sense it." The face swiveled around her with unnatural speed, closing in next to her ear. "What is it that that you need help with so desperately?"\n\nWhile her gut was screaming at her not to trust whatever this thing was, she decided to play along to see if she could find a way out of this ominous place. "I... I was looking for a way to turn Daybreaker back into Celestia."\n\n"Hmm..." The being retreated slightly, "That is a large need. Too large. It is beyond my power."\n\nAt that remark, Daring simply shrugged. "Hey, you asked."\n\n"But what if..." The being rose above her, "There was something else? Something... deeper than that desire? Something you have wanted since the very beginning?"\n\nDaring thought back on the past few years. Equestria had practically exploded into a cacophony of bloodshed and violence that ordinary ponies could never have comprehended. So many innocents had been forever scarred by the horrors of war. Even the alicorns had gone mad. She opened her eyes and stared at the being again. "I want peace. I want Equestria to be at peace."\n\n"I can grant you the power to do this, Daring Do." The being extended a shadowy protrusion out in front of her, "Equestria at peace. Such a task is difficult, but it can be done. All you have to do is... Let. Me. In."\n\nDespite the sinking feeling in her heart, she wanted nothing more than to see Equestria be free of war and tyranny. She grasped the being's tentacle."
