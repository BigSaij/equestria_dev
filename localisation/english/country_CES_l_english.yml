# Civil War Focuses

CES_cw_1_1:0 "Daring Do and the Jungle of Disharmony"
CES_cw_1_1_desc:0 ""Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am. I still don't know what possessed me to jump up and be the hero I portray in my books. Maybe I always was and never realized it. Either way, this will definitely be my most high-stakes adventure yet.""
CES_cw_2_1:0 "Find What Weapons We Can"
CES_cw_2_1_desc:0 "This little corner of Equestria was never particularly known for its industrial capacity. Thankfully, we've managed to locate a few unattended weapons caches that seem to have been intended for Nightmare Moon's forces."
CES_cw_2_2:0 "Request Help from the Locals"
CES_cw_2_2_desc:0 "The reality is that we are never going to defeat these crazed Lunarists if we do not have everypony united behind our backs. Daring Do has already rallied many to our cause, but we must ask for more, or we will have no hope of restoring Harmony to the southeast."
CES_cw_3_0:0 "Convert Fishing Barges"
CES_cw_3_0_desc:0 "Stableside was nowhere near the largest port in Equestria, but it did have some traffic. We're fortunate that a few fishing barges were around at the time that we were cut off from Equestria, and we're even more fortunate that their captains want to help us take back the seas."
CES_cw_3_1:0 "Prepare the Lowlands"
CES_cw_3_1_desc:0 "A direct assault into the depths of the jungles remains a difficult task. Perhaps too difficult, if our frontline reports are accurate. But what if we didn't have do all of the fighting inside of those jungles? East of Galloprey lays an open field ripe with possibilities. One such possibility is a makeshift air field, from which we can work towards taking the fight to the skies."
CES_cw_3_2:0 "The Second Bastion of Harmony"
CES_cw_3_2_desc:0 "Stableside must be the light in this darkness. But an unshaped, unguided light does not offer direction to those who need it. Daring Do may be the glue holding us together, but no one mare is capable of running a war by herself. She needs help, and that is why we must put aside our differences and fall in line so that she may guide us to victory."
CES_cw_3_3:0 "Inspire the Scared and Hopeful"
CES_cw_3_3_desc:0 "This isn't a story anymore. We are not just fighting for our lives, but for the hopes and dreams of everypony here! We may be cut off from Equestria, but the spirit of Harmony lives within each and every one of us! We cannot fail! We must not fail! WE WILL NOT FAIL!\n\nFor if we do, then Harmony itself might be lost forever."
CES_cw_3_10:0 "Refurbish the Relics"
CES_cw_3_10_desc:0 "Of the many museums Daring Do has contributed to, only one exists in this region of Equestria. Fortunately, the Stableside Museum of Equestrian History contains a veritable abundance of weaponry. Unfortunately, they are antique weaponry. Fortunately, they have never seen use. Unfortunately, they will probably fall to pieces in the jungle. We will take what we can get, though."

### Civil War events #####

daring.1.t:0 "From Book Hero To Real Hero"
daring.1.desc:0 "Things had happened so quickly.\n\nA.K. Yearling was doing book signings in Stableside when the news broke out. Nightmare Moon had returned? A civil war had begun? In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial Resistance was born."
daring.1.a:0 "They never did question what happened to A.K. Yearling, though."

daring.2.t:0 "Improvising"
daring.2.desc:0 ""What are your orders, Commander?"\n\nDaring Do could have sworn that she'd heard that question more times in the past few weeks than there were words in all of her books combined. She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""

The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the representative thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, former First Officer of the New Lunar Empire. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon. So that's what we're going to do.""
