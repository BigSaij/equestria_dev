 # Civil War Focuses
 
 CES_cw_1_1:0 "Daring Do and the Jungle of Disharmony"
 CES_cw_1_1_desc:0 ""Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am. I still don't know what possessed me to jump up and be the hero I portray in my books. Maybe I always was and never realized it. Either way, this will definitely be my most high-stakes adventure yet.""
 CES_cw_2_1:0 "Find What Weapons We Can"
 CES_cw_2_1_desc:0 "This little corner of Equestria was never particularly known for its industrial capacity. Thankfully, we've managed to locate a few unattended weapons caches that seem to have been intended for Nightmare Moon's forces. We're sure that she won't mind if we borrow them."
 CES_cw_2_2:0 "Request Help from the Locals"
 CES_cw_2_2_desc:0 "The reality is that we are never going to defeat these crazed Lunarists if we do not have everypony united behind our backs. Daring Do has already rallied many to our cause, but we must ask for more, or we will have no hope of restoring Harmony to the southeast."
 CES_cw_3_0:0 "Convert Fishing Barges"
 CES_cw_3_0_desc:0 "Stableside was nowhere near the largest port in Equestria, but it did have some traffic. We're fortunate that a few fishing barges were around at the time that we were cut off from Equestria, and we're even more fortunate that their captains want to help us take back the seas."
 CES_cw_3_1:0 "Prepare the Lowlands"
 CES_cw_3_1_desc:0 "A direct assault into the depths of the jungles remains a difficult task. Perhaps too difficult, if our frontline reports are accurate. But what if we didn't have do all of the fighting inside of those jungles? East of Galloprey lays an open field ripe with possibilities. One such possibility is a makeshift air field, from which we can work towards taking the fight to the skies."
 CES_cw_3_2:0 "The Second Bastion of Harmony"
 CES_cw_3_2_desc:0 "Stableside must be the light in this darkness. But an unshaped, unguided light does not offer direction to those who need it. Daring Do may be the glue holding us together, but no one mare is capable of running a war by herself. Our Commander needs help, and that is why we must put aside our differences and fall in line so that she may guide us to victory."
 CES_cw_3_3:0 "Inspire the Scared and Hopeful"
 CES_cw_3_3_desc:0 ""This isn't a story anymore. We are not just fighting for our lives, but for the hopes and dreams of everypony here! We may be cut off from Equestria, but the spirit of Harmony lives within each and every one of us! We cannot fail! We must not fail! WE WILL NOT FAIL! For if we do, then Harmony itself might be lost forever.""
 CES_cw_3_10:0 "Refurbish the Relics"
 CES_cw_3_10_desc:0 "Of the many museums Daring Do has contributed to, only one exists in this region of Equestria. Fortunately, the Stableside Museum of Equestrian History contains a veritable abundance of weaponry. Unfortunately, they are antique weaponry. Fortunately, they have never seen use. Unfortunately, they will probably fall to pieces in the jungle. We will take what we can get, though."
 CES_cw_4_0:0 "Repurpose Stableside's Ports"
 CES_cw_4_0_desc:0 "The ports of Stableside are nothing if not well-used. Converting them for the war effort would be both quick and easy, though we must remember to return them to their original purpose once we have succeeded in bringing peace to this land."
 CES_cw_4_1:0 "Recruit the Fisherponies"
 CES_cw_4_1_desc:0 "The famed fisherponies of Stableside have been mastering the sea for generations. While it pains us to ask them to stop and aid in something they are unfamiliar with, perhaps in the future we can reform them into proper seafaring soldiers."
 CES_cw_4_2:0 "The Daring Fighter Squadron"
 CES_cw_4_2_desc:0 "The time is now! With the Commander's blessing, our first fighters can now take flight. The sky belongs to those who live in the light of Celestia's sun, while those who subvert harmony in the shadows below are destined to be defeated!"
 CES_cw_4_3:0 "Modify the Toy Factories"
 CES_cw_4_3_desc:0 "Foals' amenities are often one of the first things to be deprioritized during wartime. With great regret, we must turn their toy factories into arms factories in hopes that one day they may grow up not needing to work in those same factories."
 CES_cw_4_4:0 "The Daring Infantry Regiments"
 CES_cw_4_4_desc:0 "When the call came out to fight against the enemies of Harmony, few answered at first. But like a bursting dam, a huge wave of volunteers have arrived from all over to fight for Celestia, with their own weapons to boot. Now forward march and show them what we're made of!"
 CES_cw_4_10:0 "Portland Center of Naval Operations"
 CES_cw_4_10_desc:0 "One advantage we seem to have over our enemies is the capacity for prolonged naval logistics. Commander Daring Do has proposed that we prepare supplies in Portland to construct additional ports along the coastline so that we may easily supply our troops after taking their territory."
 CES_cw_4_10_unlock_port_decision:0 "Completing this focus will grant us a decision to construct a §YNaval Base§! on the coastline of §YChinamitl§! to supply our troops if we control enough territory around there."
 CES_cw_5_1:0 "Nationalize the Shipwrights"
 CES_cw_5_1_desc:0 "While there are not many shipwrights within Stableside, there exists one who has the capability to churn out vessels faster than almost any other. Fortunately, the ponies running it have already agreed to help us, now it's just a matter of making their cooperation official."
 CES_cw_5_2:0 "Do All That We Can And More"
 CES_cw_5_2_desc:0 "Though we have given our all, our all is not enough! There can be no victory without sacrifice, and we must be willing to sacrifice every comfort of life if it means that future generations get to live in an Equestria where they don't have to sacrifice anything."
 CES_cw_5_4:0 "Fix Up The Workshops"
 CES_cw_5_4_desc:0 "Far too long have our arms factories been working with outdated red tape and antique equipment restricting the full capabilities of production. With the opening of our newest addition to the war effort, we can focus on bringing the rest of our factories up to code."
 CES_cw_5_5:0 "Fear Not The Night"
 CES_cw_5_5_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon's disciples stretch far throughout this land, but not all thestrals support her. There are those who would reject the Nightmare, not out of hate for her, but out of love for who she used to be."
 CES_cw_6_1:0 "The Daring Marine Regiment"
 CES_cw_6_1_desc:0 "As promised, the fisherponies are being returned to their area of expertise, albeit with lots of training and a new purpose in mind: to seize important coastal areas from those who would see Harmony thrown aside."
 CES_cw_6_2:0 "Adapt To The Jungle"
 CES_cw_6_2_desc:0 "The jungles surrounding Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan are treacherous and miserable to fight in. While we are loathe to use the tactics of our enemies, we must accept that we need to learn from them if we are to defeat them in their very home."
 CES_cw_6_3:0 "The Art of Survival" 
 CES_cw_6_3_desc:0 "Daring Do's experiences in rigorous terrains have given her an immense insight into how to survive in these areas. Together with her compatriots and associates, she will put together a manual with tips and tricks to help our troops fight in the wilds."
 CES_cw_6_4:0 "Make A Little Go A Long Way"
 CES_cw_6_4_desc:0 "This has been a weary conflict, but Commander Daring Do has transformed a once-scared group of ponies into a valiant fighting force. Before we would hoard resources in hopes that the war would end quickly, but now we see that this was not the way. We have to spread our resources as far as they will go in order to succeed."
 CES_cw_6_5:0 "Our Reasons, Our Purposes"
 CES_cw_6_5_desc:0 "Commander Daring Do is nothing if not a determined mare. Her defiant speeches seem to convey the same energy depicted in the very books bearing her name, if not more so. Even then, occasionally we must remind ourselves of what exactly we're fighting for."
 CES_cw_6_6:0 "Seize the Nightmare's Tools of War"
 CES_cw_6_6_desc:0 "As the war rages on, we've uncovered more and more supplies stored away by those who seemed to have been preparing for Nightmare Moon's return, as if they knew it was going to happen. While that remains a mystery for later, these supplies can be put to good use fighting against those whom they were intended for."
 CES_cw_7_4:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
 CES_cw_7_4_desc:0 ""For Harmony! For Equestria!" is the battle cry spearheaded by our Commander. For months we've been singing her praises, but she downplays when others call her a hero, preferring to redirect those praises back to us. For heroes are the ones that fight against the darkness. And heroes never lose."

 #intro
 CES_pw_intro_1:0 "Stabilize Stableside"
 CES_pw_intro_1_desc:0 "We may have won the civil war, but now we're faced with the challenge of actually governing the Southeast. To that end, Daring Do has begun creating the framework for a real government, one that can handle all of the "boring politics" ahead. One mare simply can't run everything by herself."
 CES_pw_intro_2:0 "Political Perplexion"
 CES_pw_intro_2_desc:0 "TODO - Good Word and Crescent Glow are candidates"
 CES_pw_intro_3:0 "Puzzling Parties"
 CES_pw_intro_3_desc:0 "TODO - Chief Maita and Caballeron are candidates"
 CES_pw_intro_4:0 "Look Upon Equestria"
 CES_pw_intro_4_desc:0 "Now that we have organized our fledgling government, the time has come to finish reestablishing contact with the rest of the continent. The only question is, what has happened to Equestria while we were busy restoring harmony to the Southeast?"

 CES_army_1_1:0 "The Southeastern Front"
 CES_army_1_1_desc:0 "It is difficult to organize a legitimate military force in the middle of a civil war, and now we're free of this yoke. The time has come to analyze our army structure and begin a long, but much-needed reorganization process. We can begin by formally training and assigning officers, as well as drilling our troops in the basic, if not essential ways of organized, modern warfare."
 CES_army_2_1:0 "The Southeastern Liberation Army"
 CES_army_2_1_desc:0 "Our victory was the combined effort of many brave souls who gave everything they had, and more. We must herald all members of the infantry as beacons of our army's success and determination.

They can run faster than a cheetah, swim better than a shark, and fight with more ferocity than a tiger. They are Daring Do's Daring Few, and to them we owe our freedom.

 CES_army_3_1:0 "The Jungle Is Our Home"
 CES_army_3_1_desc:0 "Since foalhood, many of us here became familiar with the labyrinthian rainforests and their sun-swallowing canopies that cover much of Southeastern Equestria. Let's use the knowledge of our environment to conduct a series of all-terrain exercises, then reorganize our tactics and strategies to adapt our forces to this sprawling, treacherous, and humid jungle we call home."
 CES_army_3_2:0 "Our Home We Must Protect"
 CES_army_3_2_desc:0 "With the civil war, we were denied proper military production. As a result, whatever firearms and supplies did arrive were rustic, and typically vestigial. Our war industry must be ready to produce the weapons we need if our homes are threatened ever again, and this time, whatever we hold in our hooves must be serviceable."
 CES_army_3_3:0 "Fighting Amidst the Heat and Trees"
 CES_army_3_3_desc:0 "The civil war was a logistical nightmare. Trucks of supplies would arrive late, if at all. Anything paradropped would get tangled and swallowed by the forests.

 CES_army_4_1_desc:0 "Among the many important lessons we learned from this war - irregular warfare is a paramount idea we cannot leave unexplored. Our army may be official, but at times, relying on some of the tactics we'd utilized during the civil war may pay off against an enemy unfamiliar with the laws of the jungles."
 CES_army_4_2:0 "Smuggle In Firearm Designs"
 CES_army_4_2_desc:0 "Equestria has always lacked innovative gunsmiths, and the few it has certainly wouldn't live here in the Southeast. We do, however, have neighbors that have implemented unique and efficient firearms. The ex-mercenaries of Aztlan who joined our cause know where to find their schematics. Theft isn't a noble thing, but is it so bad to seek...artistic inspiration?"
 CES_army_4_3:0 "Cannons In The Jungle"
 CES_army_4_3_desc:0 "In certain areas, the jungle offers impenetrable shelter. This benefits us, but so it may benefit quick-witted invaders able to fortify their positions.

Some of the mercenaries, pardoned following the end of the conflict, have chosen to remain here and struggle to integrate into civilian life. Why waste good talent - surely a few would be willing to offer their services should we ask?"
 CES_army_5_3:0 "Study All Aspects Of War"
 CES_army_5_3_desc:0 "War is a beast of many faces - it does not merely hinge on firearms and bayonets. We must prepare to advance our military research in any direction needed. The next step is to gather and organize more scientists, and pursue a greater number of research projects."

 CES_army_5_4_desc_solar:0 "The facts must be faced. Thestrals have abilities that ponies don't. They're masters of night combat and stealth, and have amazing hearing.

 CES_army_6_1:0 "The NEA"
 CES_army_6_1_desc:0 "With the amount of research, training, and investment we have put into our military, we have raised an army able to rival our contemporary neighbors.

 CES_army_6_2:0 "Armor For Pushing North"
 CES_army_6_2_desc:0 "As treacherous the jungle is, there is still room for tank warfare. As the trees clear further north, we will need armor to shield our infantry and push forwards through the plains and fields. It is time to advance our research and see how a giant metal box with a gun can become a more efficient killing machine than it already is."
 CES_army_6_3:0 "Get Our Logistics Sorted"
 CES_army_6_3_desc:0 "Though we have made strides in improving our logistics network and its efficiency, there are final streaks we can apply to ensure our resources move unharried through the jungle.

 CES_navy_1_1:0 "Formalise the ESEN"
 CES_navy_1_1_desc:0 "Due to the efforts of our fledgeling navy during the war, we've chosen to support those who fought for us on the seas and have those who continue fighting with us by officially turning our small fleet into the Equestrian South Eastern Navy."
 CES_navy_2_1:0 "Rebuild The Baltimare Dockyards"
 CES_navy_2_1_desc:0 "Regrettably the assaults on Baltimare had caused significant damage to it's naval infrastructure, hampering naval production and maintenance for the ESEN, as well as halting most pre-war trade through the ports. By rebuilding the ports we should be able to recapture the Charm City's luster."
 CES_navy_2_2:0 "Expand the Stableside Dockyards"
 CES_navy_2_2_desc:0 "During the war we had grown reliant on supplies and trade through the Stableside ports, which were not built to support the amount of shipments we needed. Now we have a moment to breath we can improve and expand the facilities in the city to improve supplies, shipbuilding and trade."
 CES_navy_3_1:0 "The Southeastern Coast Guard"
 CES_navy_3_1_desc:0 "Given our proximity to the Dragons and the difficulty of policing our entire coast line, it has been decided to create a Coast Guard to ensure the safety of merchants and locals across the coastal regions."
 CES_navy_3_2:0 "Develop the Saltmane Dockyards"
 CES_navy_3_2_desc:0 "Despite their position under Caballeron the Saltmane Dockyards managed to escape mostly undamaged, and picked up a large amount of trade from the traders who had wanted to go through Baltimare. Though this influx has stagnated, the Dockyards still serve as an important trading and logistical hub in the region and funds should be directed to aid in it's development."
 CES_navy_3_3:0 "The Crown Jewel of the Seas"
 CES_navy_3_3_desc:0 "It is impossible to ignore the allure of battleships upon the sea, of the pure power they hold even in the age of the carrier.\n\nSurely, despite the heavy costs and exceedingly long construction times we could try to make our own?"
 CES_navy_4_1:0 "Silent Killers"
 CES_navy_4_1_desc:0 "From our research, the most cost effective way to win a naval war is careful and clever usage of submarines. They're cheap enough to produce en masse, stealthy enough to escape detection from our foes and strong enough to strangle the economies of our enemies."
 CES_navy_4_2:0 "The Heart of a Fleet"
 CES_navy_4_2_desc:0 "Our planned battleships, though impressive, will be out of the picture for longer than we'd like. Thus some of our naval engineers have presented a plan for a sister series of heavy cruisers to fill the gaps until our battleships enter service."
 CES_navy_5_1:0 "Our Own Cruisers"
 CES_navy_5_1_desc:0 "With our forays into light ships a glaring gap between our larger and lighter projects has revealed itself. This has prompted a group of naval engineers from Baltimare to present plans for a class of light cruisers to plug this gap and ensure our naval forces are able to defend our shores."
 CES_navy_5_2:0 "Learn to Adapt, Adapt to Survive"
 CES_navy_5_2_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, whatever high command we've been able to assemble are still woefully unprepared for a true war on the seas. Primarily consisting of veteran fisherponies and defectors from Baltimare, they're unfortunately less than perfect for the role. A new generation of sailors and those with bright ideas on naval tactics shall be brought in to replace them."
 CES_navy_5_3:0 "Experimental Carriers"
 CES_navy_5_3_desc:0 "Though prohibitively expensive carriers serve a great purpose upon the seas, ensuring any assaults on far off islands would never be without air support while also being able to target enemy ships with their bombers.\nDespite our budgeters pleading for us to not pursue carriers, we can surely find a place for them in the budget. Hopefully."
 CES_navy_6_1:0 "The ESEN Admiralty"
 CES_navy_6_1_desc:0 "With the new waves of admirals and the constantly evolving state of naval warfare, it is no longer in our best interest to run every single aspect of the ESEN as a part of another branch of the military. By ensuring the ESEN Admiralty is independent from the other parts of the military, and establishing them in Saltmane, we can ensure our plans and battles upon the high seas are led by those who know the best."

 CES_air_2_1:0 "Import Surplus Fighters"
 CES_air_2_1_desc:0 "Despite their effectiveness, the fighters we had during the war were not limitless. We've only got a shell of the former number we had when the DFS was established, and even then they're of limited use in dogfights given their lack of maintenance. To bolster our forces we should purchase older models of foreign fighters."
 CES_air_2_2:0 "Import Outdated Bombers"
 CES_air_2_2_desc:0 "As nice as it would be to procure a fleet of modern bombers, our situation does not allow us to afford such an expense at the minute. For now efforts shall be made to purchase usable, but dated, foreign bomber designs to fill the ranks. Hopefully this should allow Heavy Wings time and inspiration to develop their own line of bombers."
 CES_air_3_1:0 "The Vanilla Comet"
 CES_air_3_1_desc:0 "In recent years Equestria has focused on the spitfire project, which we've been unable to access to due to communication being cut. Luckily Vanilla Clouds spent their time during the war developing their own fighter. By providing funding we should be able to help them finish it for our own usage."
 CES_air_3_2:0 "Establish Actual Airfields"
 CES_air_3_2_desc:0 "Our current airfields are lacking, mostly cleared dirt runways with a few caves here and there out of desperation. With the situation more stable, we can construct actual facilities across the country to ensure we can use our new planes rather than end up with them stuck up a tree or halfway through a cave."
 CES_air_3_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Saltmane"
 CES_air_3_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings, a Baltimare firm focused on the design of twin engine bombers, have offered up a fleet of naval bombers which were to be shipped to Equestria shortly before the civil war began.\n\nSince they've been sitting in stockpile we'd be able to get them for a small fee to complement our air force."
 CES_air_4_1:0 "Standardize SEAF Training"
 CES_air_4_1_desc:0 "Though our current pilots are veterans of the war and hopeful recruits, they're not going to last. We should take advantage of their experience while we still have access to them, and get them to act as teachers for new recruits in the expanding SEAF. By having teachers with recent experience, we can get a leg up on the ever changing world of military aviation."
 CES_air_4_2:0 "Support Heavy Wings"
 CES_air_4_2_desc:0 "Given their lack of buyers recently, Heavy Wings have fallen on hard times. If we were to give them funding to get back on their feet, in exchange for some of their designers, then they should be able to stand with us when we need them."
 CES_air_5_1:0 "The Vanilla Mosquito"
 CES_air_5_1_desc:0 "After the success of the Vanilla Comet, Vanilla Clouds has come up with a new design for a CAS role. Designed to bomb light targets while the Comet focuses on distracting enemy fighters, it should ensure our troops are able to punch far above their own weight."
 CES_air_5_2:0 "Night Fighter Squadrons"
 CES_air_5_2_desc:0 "There exists a type of fighting mostly ignored by other countries, that of using the night as you would any other weapon in your arsenal. By having planes painted dark to blend in with the night's sky, and pilots trained with the night in mind, we can ensure our enemy fears us no matter the hour!"
 CES_air_5_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Baltimare"
 CES_air_5_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings have unveiled a new project, one that truly lives up to their name. The Heavy Wings Baltimare promises to fly like a rock, handle like a bull and carry enough explosives to level a town. Despite some reservations, it isn't the most far fetched idea for an aircraft they've delivered and with a few fixes it could be used to great effect."
 CES_air_6_1:0 "Through Adversity to the Stars"
 CES_air_6_1_desc:0 "Throughout the SEAF a new feeling has emerged, that of pride. Of their craft, of the skies they fight in and of their fellow airponies.\nThought of as an extension of the airponies closeness to the skies, this pride propels them to go further than they thought they could.\nTo push them high enough arrive at the very stars themselves."

 CES_industry_2_1:0 "Focus On The Countryside"
 CES_industry_2_1_desc:0 "[CES.GetLeader] has chosen to focus on developing our abundant interior to restore our economy. Most resources within the Southeast can be easily exploited to fuel our industry or sold at a reasonable price to others."
 CES_industry_2_2:0 "Focus On The Port Cities"
 CES_industry_2_2_desc:0 "[CES.GetLeader] has chosen to focus on developing our industrial centers on the coast. With a few pushes in the right direction, and enough funds to fuel their fires they can stand among the great cities of the world as beacons of industrial development."
 CES_industry_3_1:0 "Secure Our Rubber Production"
 CES_industry_3_1_desc:0 "The main lifeblood of Southeastern trade after the turn of the millenium was it's vast amount of rubber, a necessity in both modern civilian goods and military equipment. Most of the companies exploiting the area were scared off by the war, leaving a perfect gap for us to acquire these fields for ourselves."
 CES_industry_3_2:0 "Pave The Southeast"
 CES_industry_3_2_desc:0 "The world around us has changed drastically in the last few years, and even before that the infrastructure of the Southeast was dated. No matter whether we're developing the interior or our ports we cannot survive solely on river and ocean trade. We need to connect our towns and cities by hoof, rail and road."
 CES_industry_3_3:0 "Restore Baltimare Industries"
 CES_industry_3_3_desc:0 "The industries of Baltimare have suffered greatly in recent memory, from both the war and pre-war neglect. Yet still the area shows great potential for industrial expansion and revitalisation. If we want to partake in the prosperity of the area, we must help fund rebuilding efforts."
 CES_industry_4_1:0 "Develop Coffee Plantations"
 CES_industry_4_1_desc:0 "Coffee beans.\n\nSecond only to rubber as the most vital export for the Southeast. They can be sold at luxurious prices across the world while being relatively simple to grow in our nation. With a few careful pushes we can easily expand production to boost our economy."
 CES_industry_4_2:0 "Incentivise Jungle Housing"
 CES_industry_4_2_desc:0 "Most of our internal industrial centers are seperated by hundreds of acres of jungle. By carefully cutting paths and roads through the jungle we can speed up transportation between factories and establish small settlements between cities to improve efficiency."
 CES_industry_4_3:0 "Expand the Baltimare Steel Mills"
 CES_industry_4_3_desc:0 "Our industry demands raw resources. Aluminium, Rubber, Tungsten, but most importantly it hungers for as much Steel as we can feed it. The old steelworks of Baltimare which were used to great effect in the war would help satiate our industry."
 CES_industry_4_4:0 "Formalise The Stableside Armouries"
 CES_industry_4_4_desc:0 "Though the Humble Corner of Harmony served us well, we still have need of it's industry. There are many ponies who threw themselves into the production of military equipment when the war began, and they should be honoured and supported just as well as those who fought in the jungles. We can accomplish this by funding some of the more prominent armourers who served."
 CES_industry_5_1:0 "The Riches of the Jungles"
 CES_industry_5_1_desc:0 "With the material wealth of the Southeast, we have managed to reverse the economic decline caused by the war, and finally managed to turn a profit again. Since we have a more stable economic leg to stand on we can reinvest into the economy to ensure this isn't just a temporary fluke."
 CES_industry_5_2:0 "Build Hydroelectric Dams"
 CES_industry_5_2_desc:0 "An investor from Les Meridiennes has come with a proposal for the construction of dams across the great rivers of the Southeast. Though the project will be expensive, the potential gain from electrical generation would fuel our industrial expansion greatly."
 CES_industry_5_3:0 "Our Own Industrial Revolution"
 CES_industry_5_3_desc:0 "With production of goods and services within the port cities picking up steam at a far greater pace than we expected, our economy isn't anywhere near as dire as it had been. Since our economic standing is more stable we can afford to take a few more risks and reinvest our profits from these ventures into further expansion!"
 CES_industry_6_1:0 "Re-fund Diamond Mining"
 CES_industry_6_1_desc:0 "An incredibly lucrative industry in the Aztlan jungles are the diamond mines contained within. The beautiful gemstone can be found in vast quantities and, if given a small push, can easily bring in enough bits to help finance our other projects."
 CES_industry_6_2:0 "Restore the Logging Industries"
 CES_industry_6_2_desc:0 "The trees that make up the jungles and forests of the Southeast province high quality wood which is desired by elites throughout the world. Able to be used in the most exquisite furniture a noble could buy, we can easily find a buyer for our products if we help restore pre-war logging companies under our purview."
 CES_industry_6_3:0 "Plan Public Works Projects"
 CES_industry_6_3_desc:0 "Despite the economical success of our industrial expansion efforts, many ponies still remain unemployed and would likely remain so if we simply ignored the issue. By funding public works projects to help construct factories and other important industrial infrastructure we can provide everypony a job for a brief period."
 CES_industry_6_4:0 "Continue Industrial Expansion"
 CES_industry_6_4_desc:0 "With a more secure economic standing, and more investments showing great signs day after day, we can finance further industrial projects across the nation to help expand our other cities, our production and hopefully provide jobs for those ponies who need them the most."
 CES_industry_7_1:0 "Develop Our Own Electronics"
 CES_industry_7_1_desc:0 "For the most part we've been using electronics which were left behind before the war started. Though these have served us well, we must move on and use a new generations of radars, computers and fire control systems. Though offers have come from abroad, we've turned them down as this is a perfect opportunity to develop our own electronics for future use."
 CES_industry_7_2:0 "Modernise Our Production Methods"
 CES_industry_7_2_desc:0 "It's all well and good to build more factories, but the most important factor within each factory is efficiency. By refining our production methods and ensuring that they are as efficient as we can possibly make them we can ensure our continued prosperity."
 CES_industry_7_3:0 "Fund Our New Synthetic Industries"
 CES_industry_7_3_desc:0 "Despite our fields of rubber, we do not hold as much oil production as we'd like. Thus proposals for experiments in the field of producing oil artificially have been accepted, with the first facilities already under construction."
 CES_industry_8_1:0 "Create the Stableside Technical Institute"
 CES_industry_8_1_desc:0 "With our economy showing no signs of slowing, we now have the leeway required to sponsor new scientific developments at a new university in Stableside.

 daring.1.desc:0 "Things had happened so quickly.\n\nA.K. Yearling was doing book signings in Stableside when the news broke out. Nightmare Moon had returned? A civil war had begun? In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial Resistance was born."

 daring.2.desc:0 ""What are your orders, Commander?"\n\nDaring Do could have sworn that she'd heard that question more times in the past few weeks than there were words in all of her books combined. She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""

It was fitting, all things considered, that the last of the Lunarist forces laid down their weapons and surrendered at the break of dawn.\n\nWhile they have shown us nothing but hatred in recent times, we must be better than them. We are Equestrians, and so are they, even if they don't see it that way. Provided that our former enemies do not betray our kindness, they will be treated the same way that everypony should be: as a friend."

 daring.4.desc:0 "It was not every day that a "fictional" adventurer who writes books about herself under a secret identity ends up leading an army of ragtag freedom fighters against fanatical Nightmare Moon cultists, bloodthirsty mercenaries, and worst of all, socialists. Not to mention that a certain loudmouth kept following her into active war zones just to complain about how the "original trilogy's Daring Do" would have handled things differently. Quibble Pants was his name, right?\n\n"...and on page 137 of Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone, it CLEARLY STATES that quote: 'Daring Do would never intentionally place herself or others in danger!' Furthermore..." On and on he went, ranting about the tiniest details.\n\n"Everypony's a critic..." She muttered under her breath. Fortunately, help arrived in the form of two ponies that recently assisted her in organizing her forces. The former was a young, neatly dressed stallion by the name of Good Word, the latter a... generously sized, middle-aged stallion adorned with dress-like attire traditionally worn by the natives of the Equestrian Southeast. Chief Maita, she recalled.\n\n"Ah, Commander Do! It is good that you are here!" exclaimed Chief Maita, paying no heed to the odd earth pony rambling on behind her. He approached Daring Do and scooped her up in an enormous embrace that caught her off guard, "I have gathered all members of my tribe as requested! And several neighboring ones as well! They will join the fight under your banner."\n\nDaring struggled to breathe. "Good... to see... you too... Stop hugging!"\n\nAs Chief Maita released her, Good Word trotted up to her with an enthusiastic smile. "Greetings Commander Daring. You will be pleased to know that the Friendship Lodge is working tirelessly to organize volunteers for the cause. Your message of fighting for harmony is being spread far and wide... well, as far and wide as it can reasonably go without long-distance communication."\n\nThis was progressing better than she anticipated. "Thank you both. Please ensure that any new recruits get at least some basic training before they're sent to fight. And it's just Daring Do." She nodded, then excused herself to try to escape Quibble's unending criticisms.\n\nGood Word and Chief Maita exchanged glances. "She is commanding us though, isn't she?" Both shrugged."

 daring.5.t:0 "A Day At The Ranges" #Sentry
 daring.5.desc:0 "Daring Do peered over her clipboard at the training area before her. She had her reservations when the plans were made, but seeing ponies determinedly train even with the limited equipment they had been given was enough to assuage them. Even now dozens of ponies flitted through the air, performed basic drills, and trained at the firing range.\n\nWandering across the courtyard, Daring couldn't help but start listening to the overlapping conversations around her from the raw recruits. Those brave souls who stood for harmony talked of home and of hope. She smiled, before hearing some wondering where their friends who'd signed up before them had gone.\n\nDaring picked up the pace.\n\nHer thoughts were thrown aside as she heard a deafening crack from the firing range, followed by a string of expletives. Moving towards the range, Daring could see a mare struggling with an anti-tank rifle almost as large as she was. "Oh come on! I just got this stupid thing fixed..."\n\nTrotting over, Daring noticed the look in the mare's eyes. As they readied another shot, Daring decocked the rifle, causing the mare to look up at her in surprise. "This thing's been seeing far more action in the past few months than it's seen in years, I'm not surprised it's being grouchy." Daring said as she patted the weapon.\n\n"I can understand that but it's just-" The mare sighed, "I'm going to be relying on it soon enough, and I can't afford it breaking when I need it. If it does then..."\n\nThe unspoken statement hung in the air for a moment as Daring softened her gaze. "I've found throughout the years that the least reliable tool will always end up working when the moment is critical. All it takes is the courage to trust it to the end."\n\nThe mare gulped and looked at the rifle. "What if I don"t have that courage?" Daring smiled."

 daring.6.t:0 "At Your Service, Commander" #Sentry
 daring.6.desc:0 "After finalising the agreements with the Stableside Tradition Co, Daring Do decided to take a walk across the Stableside docks. The refreshing scent of the ocean filled the air as Daring's gaze settled on a dock where a damaged destroyer was being tended to.\n\nThe ship was worked on by a strangely efficient team composed of pegasi and the occasional griffon, while a tall, blue unicorn mare passing up materials and giving orders. Getting closer, Daring noted just how focused the unicorn was on her team. Daring had even made it directly behind the mare without her even taking her eyes off the materials she was passing up.\n\nEventually, Daring spoke up. "Seems like ha-" Her unexpected voice startled the mare, causing her to lose control of the metal sheet she was passing up. In a split second Daring dived forward, tackling the mare to get both of them out of the way.\n\nAs the dust settled, the mare winced and opened her eyes. "Ow... Why'd you—Wait, C-Commander Daring?" She blinked in recognition, shakily standing and extending a hoof to Daring. "I-I'm Azure Bliss, the 'new' captain of this ship. To what do I owe the pleasure?"\n\nDaring took the hoof and steadily stood back up, brushing herself off as she did so. "I needed some fresh air after a stuffy meeting. Anyways, what's going on with this ship? I thought the scheduled maintenance ended a month ago?"\n\nAzure rubbed the back of her neck guiltily. "Well, the last patrol did a number to the front of the ship and the l-last captain. We brought the ship back for repairs, but after looking at the damage I figured that maybe a bit more armour wouldn't hurt much, a-and-"\n\nDaring examined the additions. It wasn't perfect, but considering they were made out of spare metal, haphazard welds and some hopes, it looked to be surprisingly sturdy. Daring couldn't really tell more than that, since her expertise in adventuring equipment didn't cover warships. She'd have to ask a naval officer, which the resistance was still sorely lacking.\n\nDaring's ears perked up as she observed the rambling mare. There weren't many options left for naval officers since any admiral worth their saltlick had either thrown their lot in with Baltimare or ran north to serve Celestia. They didn't need the perfect pony for the job, just somepony to hold the fort until the war was over or until a more qualified pony came along. Ultimately, Daring shrugged as a decision formed in her mind."
 daring.6.a:0 "Eh, she'll do."
 
 daring.7.t:0 "A Surprise, To Be Sure" #podrick
 daring.7.desc:0 "The second-to-last thing that Daring Do had expected when she awoke was to find a sizable army of Lunarists just outside of her frontline outpost. The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the relatively young thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, First Officer of the New Lunar Empire's southeastern theatre. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon. So that's what we're going to do.""
 daring.7.a:0 "But a very, very welcome one."
 
 daring.8.t:0 "What We're Fighting For" #podrick
 daring.8.desc:0 "It was unusual that Daring Do managed to find time to sit down and speak with her general staff nowadays, though today was an exceptionally rare occurrence in that all of her most helpful advisors were together in one place. This presented an opportunity that she couldn't afford to pass up. She summoned Good Word, Chief Maita, and Crescent Glow into her tent.\n\nThe four of them shuffled in, three of whom were wondering what the matter was. "What are you all fighting for?" Daring began, "I want to know your personal reasons, all of you."\n\nWithout hesitation, Good Word spoke up first. "I believe that Celestia will protect us so long as we have faith in her. She has watched over us for as long as Equestria has existed, and she will continue to do so as long as we follow her teachings and strive to be like her most faithful student. For these reasons, I fight in her name." His overly enthusiastic praise of Celestia garnered some raised eyebrows, but no one commented on it.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, Crescent Glow took a deep breath and said, "You've already heard my reasons, Commander, but... I think I have another reason now. Before she became Nightmare Moon again, Princess Luna spoke highly of her sister and the Elements of Harmony. Of how they once helped her in her darkest hour. It's my hope that we'll be able to bring them all together again so that they can return her to normal, hopefully for good. That is what I'm fighting for."\n\nChief Maita nodded at the thestral's insightful comment. As all eyes laid on him, he simply shrugged. "War is too noisy, too bloody. That means I must keep the foals at home. I fight so that the foals may safely play outside without disturbing my sleep."\n\nDaring stifled a chuckle, then picked up a pen. "These reasons and more are why we will win. Do you all mind if I put your words into propaganda?" Her advisors shook their heads, "Great! Once we secure control of the Southeast, we can reestablish contact with Equestria to help Celestia, help Luna, and most importantly, get some well-needed rest!""

A few ponies putting together supplies was now a full logistics network; a few dozen partisans listening to Daring Do's requests were now a legion of freshly-trained soldiers awaiting their Commander's orders.\n\nRaising her megaphone, Daring addressed the troops standing before her. "When we began this fight, we were just a disorganized group of scared ponies," She paused, looking out at all of the ponies who had volunteered for her cause, "But now we're much more than that! I don't see disorganized partisans, I see a full rebellion against disharmony! I don't see scared ponies, I see determined crusaders! I don't see Nightmare Moon's subjects, I see Equestrians!"\n\nThe crowd stomped their hooves and cheered as Daring Do briefly lowered her megaphone. She was surprised at how motivational speeches came naturally to her. A lot of time spent writing captivating phrases in her books seemed to help out in this regard. Maybe she really was cut out for this whole "heroic figure" thing. That thought caused her eyes to light up and her megaphone to be raised again. "There's a word for ponies who fight for a good cause against a superior foe. The moment we decided to not accept disharmony, we became that which we tell our foals about at night: Heroes. And you know we also tell them? That HEROES NEVER LOSE!""

Until then, the Commander must address the increasingly noticeable lack of an actual governing body in the Southeast."

 daring.11.desc:0 "The first step, of course, was to choose a city as the capital of our fledgling nation. Stableside seemed like the obvious candidate, as it suffered the least damage from the war. The second step was to select a building capable of housing a government. Unfortunately, Stableside City Hall was not nearly big enough for the task at hoof, so blueprints for an expansion were drawn up and construction began in earnest.\n\nNext was the issue of how the nation should be run. Despite the... objectionable beliefs of the ponies in Baltimare, they seemed to have nailed the idea of governing quite well. And so, Daring Do had proclaimed that a republic would be established, complete with a parliament and elections for a president once the new capitol building was finished. The unique role of "Commander" would still retain full control of the military, but only Daring would ever hold the title.\n\nWhat Daring neglected to mention, however, was that she planned to step down once everything was set up so she could go back to adventuring and writing books. She hoped that everything would work out, as she was putting a lot of faith in the ponies of the Southeast to do the right thing.\n\nFor now, though, they had to hurry and finish building the capitol."

Namely, expanding Stableside's city hall into a building capable of governing the entire region. It was here that two of the Commander's advisors found themselves setting up desks and furniture when one of them broke the silence, "Why do some other thestrals call you a 'Celestian?'" \n\nThe question, though innocent in nature, seemed to pierce the humble earth pony. Good Word's ever-cheerful demeanor seemed to falter momentarily. "I believe it is a derogatory term used for ponies who are as... enthusiastic about Celestia as myself. You grew up in Ayacachtli, didn't you? I figured you would know."\n\nCrescent Glow nodded, turning to help her companion move a table. "Well, I was kind of sheltered growing up. I was never allowed to leave the caves as a filly," She chuckled nervously, "The first time I met ponies from the other tribes was when my parents let me go to Canterlot University."\n\n"I've always wanted to see both of those places," Good Word sighed as they hefted the table to the other side of the room, "Just last year, I foolishly tried to preach the lessons of Celestia and her faithful student to the thestrals near Ayacachtli. They never let me into the city as you can imagine. I am curious, though: Is it true that there's a giant statue of Princess Luna in the central region of the cavern?"\n\n"Yeah. I actually got to see her, you know? I'll never forget it... and..." Crescent stopped. Her breathing became shaky.\n\nGood Word noticed the thestral's crumbling expression and trotted over to her. "You miss her, don't you?" Crescent nodded, trying to hide her sniffling. Good Word offered her a comforting hoof, "Hey, don't cry. Maybe there's a way we can bring her back. The Elements of Harmony did it before."\n\nCrescent gently brushed aside his hoof, "I also got to see Celestia, too. I'm not sure how, but I could tell that she had suffered while Luna was gone. I then realized that the Sun and the Moon must live together in harmony. One isn't more important than the other."\n\nThe earth pony raised an eyebrow, "I know that my preference for Celestia is obvious, but I don't discount that Luna is also important.

"You could help me go through all of this, you know," the adventurer said with a hint of annoyance. "Many hooves make light work."\n\nThe chief laughed. "But you seem to be enjoying yourself!" he responded, amused. "I take it this is not the work you did in Commander Daring's stories?"\n\n"As much as she paints me as the villain, her books are at least more exciting to read than this."\n\nThe native pony finally got out of his chair and walked over to one of the stacks of paper Caballeron had made. "So tell me, Mister Caballeron, why is it that you volunteered for... setting up an independent parliament free from executive control?"\n\n"First, it's Doctor Caballeron. Second, because the Southeast must be free from the whims of Daring Do or whoever takes her place. It must be able to stand by itself, free from others."\n\nChief Maita raised an eyebrow. "Even you?" Caballeron looked at him, and the native laughed again. "I have spoken with the tribes you worked with during the war. They told me of your leadership, your desire to see them free... there is more to you than you know, Doctor. Perhaps you are the one ponies want." He shrugged. "Or perhaps I am simply seeing things. You are the Doctor, after all."\n\nMaita turned to leave, a stunned Caballeron behind him. "Wait," the other finally responded, causing the chief to pause. "What about you? Are you one to lead as well?"\n\nMaita thought for a moment before answering. "My people wish to me to try, so I shall.

Surprisingly, despite the diverse makeup of ponies representing parliament, there were scarcely any disagreements between them. Thestrals, tribal natives, ponies from the Friendship Lodge, and all other sorts were present and conversing in relative peace. Even the former mayor of Baltimare held a seat, though he seldom voted in favor for any motions.\n\nDaring Do sat near the back of the room as she watched the meeting unfold. Elections for a president were set to begin in a few weeks, and so she had decided to wait until then to make the announcement of her resignation. She allowed herself a smile as she saw Good Word and Crescent Glow chatting together in the corner of the room. They both seemed to enjoy the other's company, despite their differences.\n\nHer smile morphed into a frown as she spotted Doctor Caballeron speaking with a few members of parliament. What was he up to? As she was considering going over to investigate, she heard a bellow of laughter behind her; Chief Maita had garnered a decent crowd to listen to a no-doubt humorous tale, much to the annoyance of the ponies nearby who were trying to pay attention to what the speaker on stage was saying.\n\nIn time, the session began to wind down as all of the most important issues were addressed. Just as the closing remarks were given, a disheveled stallion rushed on stage. He was holding a small device that hadn't graced Stableside since the civil war began - a ham radio. He exclaimed that he had traveled a long way in order to obtain it; he returned home as fast as he could once he confirmed that it could pick up transmissions from Canterlot.\n\nThis caused quite a stir within the room, as nopony really knew what was truly going on in the rest of the continent. Sure, there were always travelers and passing vessels with the occasional rumor, but it was hard to get concrete information from the conflicting reports given by said travelers.\n\nSeveral ponies murmured as the stallion fiddled with the radio. Just what had happened to Equestria while they were busy uniting the Southeast?"

 daring.15.desc:0 "Most of the ponies that Daring Do had come into conflict with in the Southeast were enemies due to circumstance or choice. Those who fought for the Nightmare were against harmony, and those from Baltimare sought the downfall of the Princesses. It was their beliefs which had run contrary to her own, and thus they were enemies on the battlefield.\n\nIn this case, however, the distaste was very much personal.\n\n"Did things not go as planned, Caballeron?" Daring asked with no small amount of satisfaction as she watched her old rival's bitterness deepen. He and his most loyal mercenaries and natives had fled following the fall of his self-proclaimed free state, seeking refuge in Stableside. That was why he was now here, pleading his case to his former arch-nemesis.\n\nCaballeron ground his teeth, trying to maintain his usual confident demeanor. "We are here because we understand that you are the best option for us now. Thus, my forces and I have decided to... to ask you for help."\n\n"What was that, Caballeron?" she asked, smirking. "Couldn't hear you there."\n\n"We need your help, Daring Do!" the adventurer finally exploded, revealing his true desperation. "Now will you help us or not?"\n\nDaring Do made a big deal of thinking it over for a minute before putting her hoof down, just to make the moment last. "Well, lucky for you, helping other ponies out is what heroes do... even if they have dubious past histories."\n\nCaballeron wisely chose to keep his mouth shut for once. Instead he just nodded, and turned to leave. "Caballeron," Daring called after him, "I don't want to hear any trouble from you either. No funny business, or else I'll have to rescind those pardons.""

"Don't say something like that, Celestia would never become like Nightmare Moon." And yet, as more and more information filtered in on the drastic structural changes that had occurred in the Equestrian government, it quickly became undeniable.\n\nCelestia and Equestria were no more. "Daybreaker" and the "Solar Empire" were the new reality that we lived in.\n\nThis realization set in perhaps the most heated argument in Stableside's history: Whether to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia or to instead refuse to bow down to this twisted version of the princess of the sun.\n\nNotably, the ponies of the Friendship Lodge refused to take an official stance on the matter, though any outside observer could clearly tell that the organization was on the verge of undergoing a violent schism due to their almost fanatical adoration for Celestia. Instead, it was most of the civilian population of the Southeast that seemed eager to throw their lot in with Daybreaker, with many claiming that they were "tired of fighting" or that it was "about time that Celestia did something about all the problems in Equestria."\n\nMeanwhile, Daring Do remained quiet in the background throughout the entire referendum, confident that the ponies of the Southeast would make the only sensible choice."

Representing the Friendship Lodge, Good Word spoke for most ponies who outwardly favored Celestia and values she stood for. While his views on the princess were a bit more enthusiastic than most, those views were also agreed upon by almost everypony.\n\nCrescent Glow, the former Night Guard officer from Ayacachtli had received a substantial number of votes from the thestral population. While she was a devout follower of Princess Luna, she vehemently rejected Nightmare Moon, claiming that her entire people were fed poisonous beliefs for generations, and has similarly claimed that "Lunarism" is not inherently opposed to harmony.\n\nHailing from the Hidden Tribes, Chief Maita had become a surprising addition to the race. His extremely charismatic and laid-back nature had earned him a large following. Some of his support can be tied to many of the recreational and conservational policies that he wished to implement for the native populations, but mostly because of how matter-of-fact his views were: He just wants everypony's foals to grow up in a safe place.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking turn of events was the final candidate: a certain Doctor Caballeron, who seemed to have ridden his status as a "villain and rival" to Daring Do to great effect, as many fans of the Daring Do books secretly liked him more than the titular adventurer! No doubt the Commander would have a word to say about this if he were to win, especially considering that he had fought against us in the war!\n\nThe results were very close, but in the end, only one candidate had earned enough votes to become President..."

While I do appreciate having a nice place to work, I'd prefer that we spend our funds on helping those in need rather than ensuring that I feel comfy."\n\n"Always the humble one. Yeah, you're free to do whatever you want with this place." Daring trotted over to Good Word, then spotted some construction workers putting the finishing touches on the courtyard through the window. She motioned for him to watch with her. The ponies outside seemed to be laughing with each other as they worked.\n\n"So," Daring broke the short silence, "What made you want to run for president?"\n\n"Well..."

To show them that, in the end, there is a light in the darkness."\n\nDaring whistled, "Poetic. But there's one thing that concerns me." Good Word raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Daring continued, "Your 'community', the Friendship Lodge. They're not gonna like, force their beliefs upon other ponies, are they?"\n\nHe vehemently shook his head, "No. We're a ponytarian organization, nothing more. We help those in need, but we also want them to know how important Celestia's lessons are, as well as those of Twilight Sparkle and her friends."\n\n"I see."

We may be a ponytarian organization, but we really did love Celestia. I loved Celestia. And... she's gone. Just like that, the symbol of harmony is no more." His eyes became wet.

You will have your friends by your side.'" She wrapped a hoof around him in encouragement, "You better remember that!

He recalled how unusual the atmosphere was, as many of the ponies who were present seemed to be more interested in hearing about how they could help the "Solar Empire" defeat her enemies rather than listening to what he had to say. His attempted segway into reaffirming the principles of friendship and harmony was even interrupted by one of the representatives that "Daybreaker" had sent in order to "assist" with their transition into becoming a "puppet state" of the "Empress."\n\nA puppet. Was that really what they were now? Good Word glanced at the portrait of Celestia hung on the wall. She was always so kind and forgiving, but the news that he kept hearing about her recent actions seemed wholly out of character for the Princess. Stories of ruthless behavior towards her sister's followers, harsh punishments for dissenters, and overly protective laws that restricted her ponies' freedom? It was too much to believe, yet the facts were in the fine print of every newspaper.\n\n"What should I do?" He asked the silent portrait. He had always thought of Celestia as the most perfect pony to ever live. It simply wasn't possible for her to become so... twisted. Surely her recent changes were just because of stress, right?\n\nCelestia's smiling portrait seemed to loom over him.\n\nI have to lead these ponies, he thought. If Celestia's most faithful student could overcome any challenge, then I shall follow in Twilight's hoofsteps - I will become Celestia's most devoted disciple.\n\nGood Word averted his eyes from the portrait, down to his copy of Twilight's Journal of Friendship on his desk.

Another would encourage reporting suspicious individuals to the authorities. A third would criminalize "disharmonious actions", subject to the interpretation of law enforcement. All of these things seemed minor, but she could tell that it would quickly become a slippery slope until harmony itself was twisted beyond recognition.\n\nMost surprising of all, though, was the fact that she was president at all. The Solar Empire did not interfere in or contest the Southeast's decision to elect a Lunarist to lead them. Crescent recalled the recent visits she had received from imperial dignitaries, and how dismissive or outright repulsed they seemed to be by her beliefs. Celestia and her ponies had become warped, self-righteous imitations of who they used to be, and Crescent could tell that their influence would inevitably seep into the Southeast given enough time.\n\nShe thought back to Daring Do's outburst when parliament had decided to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia. She sincerely thought that the Commander would be able to convince them that they were about to abandon harmony, but it seemed that she didn't know her fellow ponies nearly as well as she thought she did.\n\nCrescent opened her desk drawer to retrieve the portrait of Luna that she had hidden in there. How kind and fair the princess of the moon was... it made it all the more heartbreaking that she was all but forgotten for Nightmare Moon.\n\nThe thestral's eyes widened as she had an idea.

I have kept my tribe and others from reverting to their baser traditions, and I intend to keep the spirit of harmony present in all aspects of our society."\n\nDaring whistled, "I see. Well, I feel like you'll be a great president."\n\nHe grinned widely, "Thank you, Daring Do. I hope you are able to rest soon. War can easily become a burden on the mind."\n\nShe sighed, "I hope so too. Good luck with your paperwork.""

He glanced at the mountain of paperwork on his desk, then with some effort stood to look out the window towards the ponies that were placing the finishing touches on the courtyard of the capitol.\n\nIt had all happened so fast. Daring Do's outburst when parliament had decided to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia resulted in the Commander disappearing without a trace. Several emissaries from the Solar Empire were now present to assist with the Southeast's transition into becoming a puppet state of the Empress. The peaceful future that the chief had looked forward to so much now seemed further away than ever.\n\nHe observed an imperial dignitary scolding a construction worker for some minor error. Harmony seemed to become more and more twisted with each passing day...\n\nEven now, several of the tribes that he had represented seemed to recognize his authority less and less as they adopted the practices of Daybreaker's followers. Maita knew that he was never the most active of leaders, but even with the powers invested in him by the public, there was very little he could do to stop the poisonous beliefs of the Solar Empire from seeping into the Southeast until its unique culture was completely gone.\n\nHe missed having Daring Do around. She would know what to do.\n\nEventually, he returned to his desk. If he could do nothing else, then he would do paperwork."

 daring_harmony.6.desc_harmony:0 "So this was what it was like being president. Caballeron had heard of such titles overseas, of monarchs and prime ministers and such ruling nations. Never had he thought that he would be one himself, in a nation that had only known the monarchy and diarchy for untold years. In Aztlan, he thought himself a dictator, if not one for reasons personal to him. But a president? One elected by others? It was certainly a future he never could have seen coming.\n\nThere was irony in finding success after failure. And where that success came from, well...\n\nThe door opened, and a very familiar pony walked into the room. Caballeron made sure to settle himself into the president's chair - his chair, before a smile formed on his muzzle. "Daring Do!" he said, acting as if they were old friends. "How may I help you today?"\n\nJust as he had expected, the frustration on the mare's face only deepened. The tables being turned between the two was truly delightful. Finally, the heroine exploded. "How did you win of all ponies?" she asked, incredulous. "Out of all the ponies to be president, they chose you?"\n\nThe president smirked. "Perhaps I am just that charismatic," he responded easily, stretching back in his chair. "Or maybe your fans liked me more this whole time. Who can say? Why, is there an issue?"\n\nDaring was grounding her teeth to powder, Caballeron was sure of it. "No, there's no problem," she managed to respond. "But if I hear even one word about you trying to pull anything again-"\n\nThe doctor put a hoof up to stop her. "I will serve the Southeast to the best of my ability," he said, finally turning down his smug appearence. "I will honor the people's faith in me. After all..." The smugness returned. "Why would I lie when I've already won?"\n\nDaring Do stomped the ground twice before finally storming out of the room."

"Peace," his voice strained, a touch of pain echoing through his words. Good Word noted an amputated wing.\n\nThe unicorn went next, her eyes averted. "For the Princess," she murmured so quietly that everypony had to lean forward to hear her.\n\nNext, the bat pony, a purple sheen complementing her dark fur. She looked at Good Word with eyes that battled between rage and kindness. "To prove a point," she spoke firmly.\n\nLastly, the earth pony. Behind his glasses held shifting, anxious eyes. "T-t-to help o-others," he stuttered out.\n\nSo different, Good Word thought. He couldn't help but smile. "I see. Well, there's nothing wrong with having your own reasons, but if you wish to be a part of the lodge, there is one thing you must do: Live for others as Princess Celestia does. We are like an appendage, extending her grace to the ponies of the southeast. It doesn't matter where you come from or who you are, anypony can do this. And in each of you I sense that desire, even behind pain, adoration, anger, or fear. Despite what you believe to be your flaws, I see a chance to channel strength and love for your fellow ponies." By the end of the speech, each pony had their entire focus on Good Word, their eyes softened as their spirits subsided. Even the bat pony, whose chest contained a rage of an unknown, yet predictable origin, had tears in her eyes.\n\nGood Word smiled, then passed a set of forms to the four. "On these papers are your determined areas of work. I had hoof-picked these for all of you, and I know that you will all shine wherever you go. However, if you have any reservations, come to me, and I believe we can work something out. In the end, you're only doing what you believe is best - for both Equestria, and for Princess Celestia."\n\nThe pony turned from the four and walked down the hall, humming a familiar tune."

Countless words lined the page, highlighting the key differences between the Lunarists and Nightmareists. Tomorrow, she would bring this before her citizens in hopes that ignorance would no longer remain prevalent in the Equestrian Southeast. At least in government writing, she and her followers would be separate from Nightmare Moon's terror, and Chiropterrans would be alienated from the Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe pony spun her chair to the side and gazed out the window. Not a single living creature walked through the streets, and the buildings along the road emanated pure darkness from their windows. Crescent Glow raised the window, letting in the sound of the buzzing street lights and the subtle symphony of crickets. She momentarily closed her eyes and felt the embrace of the night breeze, then tilted her neck up and looked up. A full moon accompanied by a sea of stars floated before her, illuminating the sleeping city below.\n\nCrescent looked at an dimly lit picture of the former princess on her desk. "Why did you do it, my Princess?" she asked, "Why did you allow the Nightmare to take over?"\n\nShe felt tears well up in her eyes as she grit her teeth. She put her hooves together and closed her eyes. "Please come back, Princess Luna. Please, please, please," she begged, hoping her Princess would hear her words. She squeezed her hooves harder and harder until the point the appendages touched became numb. Her eyelids clamped even tighter. Her prayer, even louder.\n\nBut time passed, and no miracle occurred. Crescent opened her eyelids and looked at her hooves as they regained color. Would Luna even hear her words? Was she even conscious within the Nightmare?\n\nThe mare sighed and wiped her eyes. Though she no longer had her Princess, at least Celestia was still here. She was warm and kind, even if she didn't represent the bat ponies. Crescent chuckled as she felt a little jealous towards Good Word.\n\n"Enough of that, Crescent. You're better than that," she muttered to herself.

With that damnable book series chronicling her adventures (with a clear bias if he did say so himself), and the many heroics under her belt, she was able to win hearts and minds in a way not many else could. He was supposed to be the villain in the story, at least according to her narrative.\n\nCaballeron was no slouch at charisma, though, and knew exactly how to get the remaining holdouts of skepticism on his side.\n\nThe reporters filed into his office, chairs already ready for every one of them. They were who he needed on his side; the newspapers, the radios, ponies that others listened to. They were his most vocal critics... and soon his important allies.\n\n"Let's get straight to the point, President," one of them said, pulling out a notepad and pen. "What do you plan to do during your term in office? What are your goals?"\n\n"I plan to better the Southeast and make it a home for Equestrians and natives alike," he responded smoothly, as if he had said it a thousand times before. "Though we are defenders of harmony, we must also never forget those who were on this land originally, and that we are guests here."\n\nA few ponies muttered a few things to each other and took notes. Another stallion raised his hoof. "President, many still believe that you are, for lack of a better term, the 'bad guy' that you have been written as. How would you respond to such accusations?"\n\nAt that, Caballeron leaned forward a bit, putting on his best serious face. "While I understand where the accusations are coming from, I can assure you all that my actions here are genuine. I have always had the interests of the Southeast and the natives in mind, and that will not change. I am committed to a free and stable democracy, suited for this unique part of Equestria."\n\nMany of the ponies in the room nodded in agreement, and the President suppressed a small smirk.

 daring_harmony.13.t_harmony:0 "Another Session" #Sentry
 daring_harmony.13.desc_harmony:0 "Prior to the war, almost all development in the Equestrian Southeast was funded from the occasional glance of Canterlot and the will of its industrialists. Some local development had sprung up here and there, but mostly been in a losing battle with the more prominent companies in the north. The civil war had shifted the table significantly, with most companies busy focusing on supporting one side or the other, their assets had been seized and split between smaller homegrown companies and the state.\n\nWith the end of the war in the Equestrian South-East, the time has come to choose how to rebuild it. We've managed to scrape together a fair starting amount of funds, but now the Republican Congress finds itself at a crossroads in how to use it. Most points were easily agreed upon, such as improved infrastructure and the building of dams in several key rivers. Though in retrospect, such ideas were merely a way of skirting around the main issue which was now staring Tiger Eyes in the face.\n\n"With all due respect, Mister Speaker. I can not in good faith support the proposals made by the opposition." Misty Mane, a pegasi from Baltimare barked. "His proposal will generate nothing but scraps and resentment! Nopony should be damned to slave away beneath our beautiful land, it is better we focus on developing our industries."\n\nMisty Mane sat back down, amidst a polite wave of "Hear, Hear." from her party members. Tiger silenced them with a wave of his hoof, and gestured for a pony on the opposing side of the congress to present. Bit Dust, a small grey unicorn from Portland, stood up.\n\n"I understand your concerns, though I feel you may have exaggerated the dangers of such a plan." Bit said, shrugging. "Quite simply I do not believe we're ready for developing our own heavy industry yet, instead we can focus on our natural resources. By exporting them to any friendly face, either up north or across the Celestial Sea, we can use their industry to develop our own at an even greater pace!"\n\nBit sat back down amidst another wave of "Hear, Hear." Tiger Eyes sighed as he looked back towards Misty Mane, seeing a snarl curl up on her face. He'd have to call them all to vote now, before they ripped each other apart..."
 daring_harmony.13.t_resistance:0 "Another Debate"
 daring_harmony.13.desc_resistance:0 "After a set of worrying messages from Canterlot, we've found most of our previous options for funding in the hands of opposing despots. Naturally, this has limited our options for the necessary development of our new nation. While we've been able to seize the assets of Equestrian companies who sided with Canterlot, that pool of funds is steadily drying up via measures of reconstruction. Every house we rebuild brings us closer to the bottom and every repaired factory brings risks, both by foreign saboteurs and by our lack of proper tooling.\n\nThe Republican Congress, by Daring Do's order, has been tasked with finding a way to invest our remaining funds. Most ideas were easily agreed upon - improving inter-city infrastructure, the building of dams in several key rivers and other similar measures. Though, in the end, such matters were simply diversions from the glaring issue which was now rearing its ugly head before Tiger Eyes.\n\n"Mister Speaker, I cannot reasonably support the proposals made by the opposition." Misty Mane, a pegasi from Baltimare barked. "His ideas won't achieve anywhere near what we need! If we place all our bets on exporting our resources, then we'll have nothing left when Canterlot comes knocking! We must instead focus on developing our industries, otherwise what we've fought so long for will mean nothing in the end!"\n\nMisty Mane sat back down, amidst a strong wave of "Hear, Hear." from her party members. Tiger silenced them by tapping his hoof on the table, and gestured for a pony on the opposing side of the congress to present. Bit Dust, a small grey unicorn from Portland, stood up.\n\n"Another Dragon or the Egg debate, Miss Mane? Surely you must understand the plans we propose to ensure far better results," Bit stated, sighing. "Our economy is simply not ready for us to smash through it with heavy-hooved industrial plans. If we want it to survive your floundering ideas, and be ready for whatever may come, then I insist that we focus on exploiting our natural resources to the fullest extent. A large factory count is lovely on paper, but if they're making guns out of scrap then they'll amount to nothing."\n\nBit calmly sat back down amidst a louder wave of "Hear, Hear." After allowing the wave to finish, Tiger Eyes called the congressponies to cast their votes."

A glimpse of familiarity after the past few months of drastic changes, even if it was in a room filled with new and strange ponies. He counted himself lucky that his position as speaker of the house was still needed even with Daring Do out of everyone's good graces.\n\nThroughout the hall, informal discussion of faith and economics dominated the gathering. Most of the conversations Tiger could ignore, at least until it came up in official proposals, however he felt his curiosity get the best of him. Only a few ponies he worked with before were still serving in the hall, mostly engaged in discussions with the newcomers. Most of the snippets he could hear were far off topic, turning from debates to friendly chatter.\n\nIt certainly wasn't the atmosphere Tiger was used to from the congress, but he couldn't say he hated it. He watched as a senator, Misty Mane, enthusiastically debated industrial plans with a prominent Lodge member, Young Bridge. The debate was a far cry from the shouting matches Misty's debates usually became, with Misty's boisterous claims being calmly considered by the slow, yet enjoyable additions from the Lodge member.\n\nAfter a few moments of ponywatching, Tiger signalled for the day's debates and proposals to officially begin. The portraits stared as plans and proposals were discussed and approved. Most matters were easily agreed upon, such as improving jungle infrastructure and making use of the valuable rivers, but soon came the point which had caused so many heated discussions in the congress: Where to focus?\n\nDespite his worries, the calm atmosphere from earlier still hung tightly to the congress. As Misty Mane came up to present her plans, Tiger didn't expect a shouting match over where to focus their efforts, as had happened so many times before. She gave a passionate speech of industry, and the port cities which would provide the most benefits, and waited with baited breath for the expected retorts.\n\nBut none came, instead a friendly wave of "Hear, Hear!" washed over the room."

"D'they seem familiar?"\n\n"Y-yeah, that's Chip Block and his family...they've been on the streets of Baltimare for years. Chip himself is one of my employees, why?" Young nodded in the family's direction, prompting Misty to look back. The family were looking at an apartment building, and chattering happily as Chip pulled out a key. After a few moments they ascended the steps, heading inside. "Wait, Chip managed to find a place to live?"\n\nYoung looked back down at her and nodded. "Yes, thanks to you." At Misty's expression, he continued. "I met his youngest earlier today. Lovely foal, she was, talked my ear off about the work her father did and the praises he'd sung of your efforts."\n\n"Not every foal in Equestria will be kind, Miss Mist." Young continued, despite Misty's floundering shock. "Some pass judgment unto others, when they themselves need it more." He winked. "But many will treat their fellows fairly, and such treatment will be rewarded. Be it when an age has passed, or merely when they need it most."\n\nIt took a few moments for the smile to leave Misty's face. Only when it did, did she look back at Young, his expression as kind as it always was. "...Thanks, Young."\n\n"Anytime, Miss Mane. Anytime.""

 daring_harmony.17.t_harmony:0 "An Offer for a Mercenary"
 daring_harmony.17.desc_harmony:0 "Jungle Trek was bored.\n\nIt had been a reoccuring issue as of late. Usually boredom was a very rare instance in the life of a mercenary, but ever since the fall of Aztlan he hadn't exactly been doing much of that either. The loss stung particularly hard for him; despite knowing the jungles like the back of his hoof, it hadn't changed a thing. He had been forced to surrender along with the rest of his band, guilty of treason against Equestria.\n\nAt least it hadn't been the communists or the Lunarists that had won, though. Jungle and many others were surprised to find themselves still free ponies when it was all said and done, likely as a result of their former employer switching sides and negotiating on their behalf. Many had fled, taking up new jobs overseas at the first opportunity, but not Jungle. He and a few others had stuck around, with nowhere else to go. Not that there was much to do at home, though, considering that not many were hiring for illiterate mercenaries.\n\nOr at least, that was what he had thought. An old friend of his had stopped by a few days ago and told him about an offer the government was making. They wanted him - all of them back, to serve in their new army. He would even get a position as an officer, just like back in Aztlan.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, sure. Jungle was positive that there would be plenty of boring staff meetings, irritating superiors, and a smaller bit count. He'd be part of a real army, serving a real nation instead of himself. It would be the end of his mercenary days for good.\n\nBut when all he had left was more of the same old boring days?\n\nHe'd gladly take the alternative."
 daring_harmony.17.t_resistance:0 "Moral Responsibilities"
 daring_harmony.17.desc_resistance:0 "Jungle Trek, as befitting his name, did not like the urban Equestrian cities very much. He far preferred the deep jungles, places away from civilization and modernity. Even places like Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan catered to him more than the artificial nature of Stableside and Baltimare.\n\nUnfortunately, Stableside was where he was needed, and thus it was where he would go.\n\nIt was a no-brainer when he got the offer from the government. A place back in the army as a general, with all the benefits it would bring? At the very least, it was certainly better than sitting around doing nothing as a self-proclaimed mercenary.\n\nIn reality, there were deeper motivations than just boredom, though. Jungle couldn't imagine Equestria, his real home, falling. It was like harmony itself was gone, clinging to life here in the forgotten jungles. Could he really still call himself an Equestrian if he didn't do something to help out? He still had a moral compass, after all.\n\nAnd plus, it was much better than the alternative. Jungle had already gotten pardoned once; he was fairly certain it wouldn't happen again.\n\nWith a deep breath, he walked into the looming administrative office, putting on the best aura of confidence he had left. "Hi," he said to the secretary, "I'm here about that position in the army I was offered a few days ago?""
 daring_harmony.17.t_solar:0 "Do What You Can"
 daring_harmony.17.desc_solar:0 "Jungle Trek, mercenary extraordinaire and former general of Aztlan, was confused.\n\nThis was not exactly a rare occurrence, especially as of late. Jungle did not trust the new Celestia, despite what the government said about her. A dark turn had overtaken Equestria, that was for certain. Ponies were scared, and the worst part is that here, they were not sure what to be scared of.\n\nNothing had happened... yet. There had been no purge, no great cleansing in the name of the sun as some of Jungle's collegues had assumed. He was sure that he was still on a list somewhere; treason against Equestria is not forgotten so easily. But instead of being imprisoned or executed, the government was offering him a job. A position in the army, for a generous pay.\n\nWhy did they want him? Were they testing his loyalty? Would he have to order terrible crimes on their behalf? At first, he wanted to throw the offer away and push it out of his mind, but things were never that simple. If it was not him, it would just be somepony else who may not care as much as he did. At least if he took the offer, he could try to make a real difference where it mattered.\n\nAnd if they ever showed the darker side that everypony feared... well, Jungle Trek just hoped that it wouldn't come to that."

 daring_harmony.22.desc:0 "Good Word tentatively looked out of the sky chariot that was transporting him to Canterlot. The city wasn't too far away now - it looked truly magnificent under the radiance of the sun. He thought back to the letter that he had received: a direct invitation to come to Canterlot to speak with Princess Celestia regarding "an important matter." While he thought it was kind of the princess to pay for his trip, he didn't expect the Equestrian Royal Guard to show up at his doorstep.\n\nSoon his entourage arrived in the city proper. They landed just outside of the castle entrance, then informed Good Word that the princess was waiting inside. He thanked them, then looked up at the double doors emblazoned with the sun and moon. He began to feel apprehensive, which was an unfamiliar sensation. He'd spent his whole life teaching others about the princess, yet he had never met her before...\n\nHe eventually summoned the courage to go inside. The castle interior was just as wondrous as he had imagined. Glass murals adorned the walls and ceiling, while exquisite banners and other fancy decor perfectly complemented the interior. Good Word respectfully kept his hooves to himself as he approached the throne room.\n\nThe guards nodded as they opened the doors, and in the earth pony went. The first thing he noticed was how big the room was - it was larger than the entire Grand Lodge building. The second was the lack of any additional guards. The third was a white pony with a flowing mane and tender smile sitting atop a throne. His heart skipped a beat as he saw her looking at him. He immediately bowed as all of his rehearsed greetings seemed to slip away from him. "P-Princess! It's... it's an honor!"\n\nPrincess Celestia chuckled slightly, "Oh, you needn't show such formalities, Good Word. It's just the two of us."\n\n"If... if you say so." He rose, then hesitantly approached the pony he idolized so much. "What was it that you wanted to speak with me about?"\n\n"Something that is not taught in Equestrian history, my little pony." She stood from her throne, then began to walk towards one of the rear doors. "Come, there is a better place for us to discuss this matter.""

While she thought it was kind of the princess to pay for her trip, she didn't expect the Equestrian Royal Guard to show up at her doorstep.\n\nSoon her entourage arrived in the city proper. They landed just outside of the castle entrance, then informed Crescent that the princess was waiting inside. She thanked them, then looked up at the double doors emblazoned with the sun and moon.

Glass murals adorned the walls and ceiling, while exquisite banners and other fancy decor perfectly complemented the interior. Crescent respectfully kept her hooves to herself as she approached the throne room.\n\nThe guards nodded as they opened the doors, and in Crescent went. The first thing she noticed was how big the room was - it was almost as large as the central cavern in Ayacachtli. The second was the lack of any additional guards. The third was a white pony with a flowing mane and tender smile sitting atop a throne. That would have been the end of it, but Crescent felt a pang in her heart when she noticed the smaller, empty throne next to Celestia's. She took a deep breath and trotted forward. "Greetings, princess. It's an honor to meet you."\n\nPrincess Celestia chuckled slightly, "Oh, but this is the second time we've met, Crescent. Don't you remember your graduation from Canterlot University?"\n\nCrescent mentally kicked herself. "Well, I uh, didn't think you would recognize me, and..."\n\n"Don't trouble yourself, my little pony. I always remember those that I meet."

 daring_harmony.26.desc:0 ""With respect, princess... where exactly are we going?"\n\n"A room that very few ponies know about," Celestia answered cryptically, "but I think it would be the perfect place for us to speak."\n\nThe two of them walked for some time throughout the castle's corridors, passing many rooms and even entering a secret passage to a lower section of the castle. The air was stale and the decor contained dust and cobwebs, as if they were the first visitors to enter in a hundred years. Eventually, the two reached a single plain door at the end of a torchlit hall. Celestia levitated her crown in front of the door, causing both to glow slightly. Celestia opened the door, then motioned for Good Word to follow her inside.\n\nUpon entering the room, Good Word was profoundly confused. The place was full of scrolls and tomes, along with various symbols and artworks styled after Princess Celestia. "What is this place?"\n\nThe princess walked to one of the tomes and dusted it off. The cover seemed to depict her hovering in front of a sun while ponies burned around her. "This is a collection of all of the religions that have been formed in my name."\n\nGood Word immediately felt a bowling ball drop in his gut as he realized why she had brought him here. "I... I don't understand."\n\nIf she knew that he knew, then she didn't show it. "There is something that you must know. Over the millennium since my sister's initial banishment, many cult followings were established in my name." She began to point at several collections in succession, "This one belonged to the 'Solarium.' That one, the 'Order of Sunlight.' The 'Daystar Temple.' 'Celestia's Children.'" She paused for effect, "There are more, of course. You will notice that none of them exist in any history books. That is because I've taken measures to ensure that none ever gained any significant following."\n\nGood Word gulped as he tried to process all of this. "But we're not a religion."\n\nCelestia nodded, "I know. This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours, while not quite a religion, is very close to becoming one. In truth, had I known about it prior to Nightmare Moon's return, I would have had it dismantled. But it is too late now." She approached Good Word and put a hoof onto his shoulder, "You must not allow your organization to worship me. I will not have a repeat of the Chiropterran 'religion', but with me instead of Nightmare Moon.""

Soon, they reached a lonely set of double doors where two of Celestia's royal guards stood at the ready. With a single nod from the princess, the guards stepped aside. Celestia seemed to hesitate when she reached the door. After a moment, she opened it and beckoned for Crescent to follow her inside. Upon stepping inside, Crescent's heart skipped a beat. She stood eyes wide with her mouth agape, "This is..."\n\n"Princess Luna's room," Celestia finished for her, "I... couldn't bring myself to come here. Not after I had failed her again."\n\nCrescent was silent as she absorbed her surroundings. This was... this was Luna's private chambers. Ornate decorations themed after aspects of the night were just about everywhere. A blanket on the bed with stars as numerous as the sky. Soft lights scattered the room, with a singular crescent shaped lamp hanging from the ceiling. A desk with a photo of the two princesses lay in the corner, illuminated by the moon through the skylight above.\n\n"I brought you here because I wanted to apologize to you, Crescent." Celestia began, earning a shocked expression from the thestral, "I... I wasn't there for my sister when she needed me most. Every hour of every day I am reminded of my failure, and the sorrow I feel will never go away." The princess turned away, ashamed of herself, "My sister tried everything she could to help her subjects see the real her. While the ponies of Equestria will never forget the rise of Nightmare Moon, because of your actions they will also never forget the Princess of the Night that they had lost. It is you who have kept the memory of the real Luna alive when we- when I failed to do so." A tear streamed down Celestia's face as she looked up towards the moon. "She would be so proud of you."\n\nCelestia's words broke Crescent. The tear-stricken thestral practically threw herself against Celestia. The princess let go of any pretense of regality and fully embraced her. The two sobbed quietly for some time as they reminisced of dreams long passed into memory."

 daring_adventure.1.desc:0 "Daring Do struggled to stretch her wing as she studied the old records of long-gone explorers. This cramped basement the museum called a library had little room for its contents, much less a medium-sized pegasus like herself. The stench of old, dilapidated papers and leather covers nearly kept her from entering in the first place, a challenge not even the testiest of ruins had presented to her.\n\nBut what was Daring Do without a challenge to conquer? The adventurer nodded to herself under the flickering, yellow light above to inspire confidence, and pointed her nose back to the task at hoof.\n\nAh, here it is, she thought with an audible gasp. "In the jungles of Tenochtitlan, I witnessed a battle between two tribes," she read along, "And though the fight seemed matched, there came a time when a shaman from one tribe came out, and strapped around her neck was an ebony horn, skinny and hollowed out. Much like I, the other tribe seemed confused, but their fighting did not cease."\n\n"Then, the shaman blew into her horn, and almost immediately I felt fearful, as did the other tribe. More than that, the other tribe grew stronger. Their reflexes, faster. I am not fully sure where such a horn came from, but my research has brought me to believe that it is an object more ancient than even Equestria itself. My colleagues laugh, but having experienced it, I will continue to push my theory: That horn comes from the head of an Abada. An ancient unicorn."\n\n"So, Tenochtitlan, you say?" Daring muttered with a smile as she glanced over to the map of Southeast Equestria. She marked a circle on it and chuckled."

 daring_resistance.6.desc:0 "An urgent message has reached us from [CES.GetLeader] on behalf of the Equestrian Resistance. Initially formed to fight for Celestia in the Southeastern theatre of the War of Two Sisters, their Resistance has grown into the de facto government of Southeastern Equestria. Now, with old Equestria gone, it stands as possibly the last bastion of Harmony in Equestria.\n\nThey have appealed less to our old ties to Equestria, and more to our consciences. [CES.GetLeader]'s missive contains vividly-written descriptions of the brutalities committed in the north, of the suffering waves of refugees who the Resistance has had to resettle, of her band's heroic fight to protect the defenseless. They call on us for assistance in their struggle against tyranny. While some within our government have scoffed at the idea of offering help to them, especially since they had toppled a communist revolution in Baltimare, many other officials have expressed support as they have shown leniency to the revolutionaries they had defeated, even going so far as to adopt some socialist principles in their republic.\n\nIt falls to us to decide how, if at all, we want to help our struggling neighbours."

 daring_resistance.23.desc:0 ""YOU RUINED HER!"\n\n"We freed her. You just won't accept our Goddess for who she really is."\n\nCrescent Glow was about to burst a blood vessel. When she had received a report that a spy was captured attempting to sabotage her efforts to deradicalize the thestrals, she wanted to personally interrogate the mare. What had begun as a polite conversation quickly turned into a one-sided shouting match as Crescent learned that the pony sitting before her was not actually a local, but instead an agent from Chiropterra that had helped in turning Luna back into Nightmare Moon. The mare didn't even try to hide it, she seemed proud of herself.\n\n"She was the Goddess of the Night, not Nightmares! Almost a decade of rehabilitation was wasted because of YOU!" Crescent furiously shoved a hoof into the spy's chest, knocking her and her chair to the ground.\n\nThe mare remained smug. "Luna was a false goddess. A prison made by Celestia and her 'elements of harmony' in order to keep her weak and subservient. Any servant of the night can see that Nightmare Moon is our true goddess."\n\nCrescent felt a tooth crack from how hard she was clenching her teeth. She descended upon the mare and furiously pounded the spy's face with her hooves. "LUNA! WAS! MY! GODDESS!" She screamed as tears began to form in her eyes. "SHE WAS EVERYTHING TO ME! AND YOU TOOK HER AWAY!"\n\nThe mare opened her mouth for another rebuttal but quickly was met with another rage-filled hoof to the face. Fortunately for both Crescent's temper and the mare's skull, the door to the interrogation room swung open and several ponies flooded in to restrain Crescent.\n\n"General Glow!" one of the guards said as they pulled her away from the Chiropterran thestral, "Calm down! You can't assault prisoners like that!" Despite their numbers, they struggled to keep their superior officer away from the now-bleeding mare. It was only when one guard put her into a chokehold did she begin to come to her senses.\n\nAfter nearly passing out, Crescent was released. One of the guards asked if she was okay, but she shook her head. "No. This pony and her kind have poisoned us for generations." She glanced at a document on the table with irrefutable proof of Chiropterra's involvement in the bombing of Princess Luna's last speech. "Contact Commander Daring...""

 daring_resistance.25.desc_daybreaker:0 "While the liberation of Canterlot was a momentous occasion in Daring Do's quest to restore Equestria, nopony could have expected what became of the city after Celestia's transformation into Daybreaker. Statues and emblems of Celestia and her cutie mark were replaced with fiery symbols and twisted idols that seemed to radiate heat. The welcoming, majestic architecture had been demolished and rebuilt with sacral designs.\n\nThough it had been some time since the city was reclaimed, the ravages of war still remained. Some areas and buildings contained Solarist holdouts, while ruins and the occasional bloodstain were present elsewhere.\n\nGood Word tightly clutched his Journal of Friendship as he trotted through the streets. While Canterlot was not fully secured, he knew he had to see what had befallen the city he so desperately wanted to visit as a colt. Merely traversing the once-bustling metropolis made him uncomfortable. What really sent chills down his spine, however, were the looming temples bearing the imagery of Daybreaker.\n\nHe stopped outside one such temple. It was mostly intact, though the symbol of the Solar Empire was cracked above the front entrance. He hesitated as he approached the door. He had to know what these ponies were like. He had to know just how misplaced his own faith in Celestia was.\n\nThe inside of the temple contained a deathly silence that seemed to reverberate louder than artillery fire. A stained-glass image of Daybreaker above the central altar illuminated the red and golden decor. Toppled pews and religious tapestry were strewn about. What caught his eye was a dried trail of blood leading into one of the rear chambers.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, Good Word followed the trail. His heart sank as he found a corpse - a soldier of the Solar Empire. The pony was young, likely not even twenty. It seemed like they had been mortally injured and crawled across the ground to a statue of Daybreaker. Their front hooves were clasped together before the figure, almost as if they had desperately prayed for help from the goddess that had commanded them to die in her name.\n\nEvery second he spent staring at the soldier, Good Word felt more and more sick. He fell to his knees as he contemplated his entire life. How he had spent years in service of a pony that had abandoned everything that he believed in? What might have befallen him if he had been in Canterlot instead of Stableside when Celestia had transformed? Would he have found the strength to do the right thing? Or might he have joined her? He didn't want to know the answer."

Good Word knew that some members of the Friendship Lodge had trouble accepting that Celestia had spurned harmony, but this... he glared at the photos on his desk that were taken as a part of an investigation into several missing ponies.\n\nSeveral Moonspeakers from Ayacachtli had been strung up and burned in ritualistic pyres, and the culprits behind these heinous acts were former members of the Friendship Lodge. One photo contained a clear image of a pony he knew personally, Fiery Brimstone, wearing a red and golden robe taken from one of the Solar Empire's many temples.\n\nGood Word sat back in his chair and tried not to think about anything. Yet he found himself looking over to the transcript of the interrogation with the murderers. They seemed to cherry-pick messages from the Journal of Friendship and twist them to fit their worldview. Most did not see their actions as immoral, and some even went so far as to claim that they were doing the right thing by "protecting their friends" via "cleansing the souls" of "sin."\n\n"How can I preach about friendship if others can twist it into something so vile?" He wondered aloud.\n\nThrough the corner of his eye, Celestia's smiling portrait continued to judge him.\n\nIt was all too much. Everything was wrong, everything he believed in was a lie, and it was his own faith that caused those poor ponies to suffer. He leaped from his chair and tore down the portrait from the wall. He snapped it into two and hurled it across the room, cracking the outside window in the process. He toppled the bookshelves, upheaved his desk, smashed every light, then finally curled up into a ball as he spiraled further and further into despair."

Unfortunately, the only answer she received was silence.\n\nShe took a deep breath, then unlocked the door. Peering inside, she was taken aback at the state of the room. It looked like a tornado had torn it apart; it was difficult to see anything due to the broken lights. "Are you in here?" she asked as she carefully stepped inside. Her ears perked up at the faint sound of sobbing. She made her way over to the noise, only to see her friend huddled in the corner behind a toppled bookshelf.\n\n"Go away." His voice was raspy, his breathing ragged. He looked positively dreadful - it was clear that he hadn't eaten in days.\n\nCrescent's heart broke as she realized just how hurt her friend was. She knelt down next to Good Word and lightly prodded him in an attempt to lift his spirits. "Come on, we gotta get back to work. Daring Do needs our help to bring peace to Equestria."\n\nHe turned his tear-stained face to glare at her. "What peace? What Equestria? Daybreaker and her twisted Solar Empire have poisoned the souls of everypony who believed in those things. In Celestia, too."\n\n"That's not true, and you know it. Yes, there have been some ponies who have done horrible things in her name, but that doesn't mean that everything she used to stand for is wrong." Crescent gently moved her leg under him to help him to his hooves, "I'm not going to leave you here. Don't make me carry you."\n\nGood Word turned his head away, but he did not reject her help. "I spent my entire life believing that Celestia was the most perfect pony to ever live. That she could do no wrong. I taught so many others the lessons of my beliefs, but now..." He shut his eyes, "...now I don't know what to believe anymore."\n\n"How about your friends?" Crescent said as she brought him to his shaking hooves, "I believe in the magic of friendship, don't you?" After a moment, he nodded and began to cry. She pulled him close and quietly reassured him, "Don't worry, everything will be okay. You have me and everypony else to help you remember how important friendship is.""

 daring_solar.1.desc:0 "Following the burning of the capitol building, the ponies of the Friendship Lodge mulled on how the recently-deceased parliament had just certified them as official members of the government... and now, it seems they were the *only* remaining members of the government. On top of that, they still needed to figure out how to properly integrate the Southeast into the Solar Empire. Unfortunately, both of these issues fell to the wayside the moment the topic of Celestia's transformation came up.\n\n"Celestia is perfect! We should strive to be like her, no matter what form she takes!"\n\n"I don't know, something about this Daybreaker makes me shiver. She doesn't feel like the Celestia we know and love."\n\nThe debate soon turned into a heated argument, then into a shouting match just short of a brawl as ponies began to take sides. Accusations of treachery and conspiracy were flung back and forth; it seemed like a schism in the Friendship Lodge would have formed right then and there were it not for a new arrival whose entrance shocked all present into reverent silence.\n\n"Brothers and sisters," the familiar-looking earth pony gently shut the door shut behind him, "This is unbecoming of Celestia's most faithful," Covered in bandages from head to hoof, the once ever-cheerful Good Word now seemed to emit an aura of righteous fervor as he made his way to the podium. "Do you not remember our first statute? 'Thou shalt love Celestia with all thy heart, all thy might, mind, and strength, and in Her name we shall serve Her until our last breath.'"\n\nHis voice carried a commanding tone that washed away the doubts of most of the ponies present. Still, a few were still unconvinced. "But what if Celestia's transformation is akin to Luna's? This doesn't feel right!"\n\nGood Word's gaze seemed to bore into their very souls. "Need I also remind you of one of the most important lessons in the Friendship Journal? 'Never judge a book by its cover. And a good friend, like a good book, will last forever.' Celestia may look different, but it is still Her. She will always protect us, so long as we are faithful to Her." He pointed to the exit, "If you disagree with anything that I have said, then I invite you to resign immediately."\n\nThe ponies present looked at each other, but this time with comfort instead of frustration now that their president sounded more like a prophet."

 daring_solar.2.t:0 "The Lodge's Transformation" #podrick
 daring_solar.2.desc:0 "While previously the Friendship Lodge was always a loosely connected ponytarian network devoted to preaching about Celestia, the advent of her transformation combined with the spiritual rebirth of Good Word seemed to trigger a sudden change in the entire organization. Gone were any doubts about Celestia's status as a divine figure. Good Word had rapidly become a rallying leader even more so than Daring Do was, for how could he have survived such an inferno if he was not personally blessed by Celestia?\n\nAs news of Good Word's survival spread throughout the southeast, the Friendship Lodge's membership had practically skyrocketed. Almost a hundred thousand ponies from all walks of life had signed up just within a week; some because they believed that Celestia could do no wrong, while others saw the "Burned Stallion" as a sorely needed voice to guide them in these tumultuous times.\n\nAnd guide them he would.\n\nThe first changes were subtle: A few Lodge-aligned amendments were made to the fledgling republic's constitution. Funds were set aside to construct additional Lodges. Less devout members of parliament were replaced with more fervent ones.\n\nTo any outside observer, especially the most devout Lunarists in Ayacachtli, it looked like the beginnings of a cult takeover. They began to take measures to protect themselves from being purged, but no attempt at removing the thestrals ever came. The missionaries from the Friendship Lodge continued to make their humble journeys to proselytize, the only difference being a spark in their eyes that wasn't there before. They spoke of Good Word almost as if he was equal in status to Twilight Sparkle, if not more so. As if Celestia had personally granted him that status."

 daring_solar.3.t:0 "The Sparks of Religion" #podrick
 daring_solar.3.desc:0 "Outside of government affairs, the changes were gradual. More and more ponies attended Friendship Lodge services. Ponies already spoke highly of Celestia, but now they made snide remarks to those who did not praise her. Phrases such as "We love Celestia" became "We worship Celestia."\n\nLunarist holdouts became worried. What was going on? Many of them were terrified that something big was about to happen, especially as the weeks went on, but nopony had come for them yet. Still, they continued to turn away the Friendship Lodge's missionaries, nonviolently of course, in hopes that they would be left alone.\n\nStrangely enough, despite all of the official missives coming in from the Solar Empire, the ponies of the southeast did not refer to the Goddess as Daybreaker, instead choosing to continue calling her Celestia. Their reasons varied, though the most consistent answers given were as thus: "Celestia will always be our Goddess, no matter what form she takes."\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all was the number of Lodges that had appeared in the wake of Good Word's return. Before they had scattered the land with only a few in each major city, now there were dozens in almost every town, with some even having over a hundred. The weekly services of the Friendship Lodge saw more and more ponies adopting their beliefs, with some places having so many attending these services that businesses were forced to close on those days."

It was clear by her enthusiastic chant and sudden halting of it that she expected others to join in with her. From the frightened glances of the chained thestrals to the concerned expression of the jury, all eyes were on her.\n\n"This is not the faith that we teach," Good Word stood from the seat where he was overseeing the verdict. His gaze seemed to bore holes into the mare. "While the sinners on trial today have committed heinous crimes against myself and our Goddess, they are only that: sinners. Are thestrals inherently sinners? If you believe the answer to that is anything but no, then I weep for you. I weep for you as I weep for those who reject Celestia's light."\n\nThe mare seemed to backpedal a bit. "Well, I didn't mean it like that, but come on, they're bats! You know they're never going to-"\n\nThe sound of a gunshot pierced the ears of all in the courtroom. There were brief gasps of shock as all present realized that Good Word had just executed the mare.\n\nRaising his pistol into the air, Good Word addressed all of the ponies before him, "Heed my words: That mare held a deep-seated hatred for all thestrals within her. It clouded her judgment and would have led to unjustified acts of violence against bat ponies. Let it be known that all are equal in the eyes of the Goddess, regardless of heritage, regardless of status, and regardless of race." He set his pistol down, then returned to his seat. "If any other members of the Friendship Lodge hold similar sentiments to this heretic, know they shall suffer the same fate."\n\nNaught but silence followed his statement. With a nod, Good Word turned to address the thestrals who had trapped him inside of his burning office, "'Guilty on all charges', was it? Perhaps punishment is in order for you all...""

 daring_solar.19.desc:0 "To say that Cricket Chirp and his family felt uncomfortable was a profound understatement. Seated in the rear of one of the Friendship Lodge's weekly congregations, they were the only bat ponies present. The only Lunarists present. Cricket was apphrensive the moment they had set hoof into the Lodge, having only shown up out of obligation from the kind acts of the missionaries. His wife and foals were equally on edge; it didn't help that their dark, moon-themed clothing made them stand out like a sore hoof.\n\nIn stark contrast, the members of the Friendship Lodge all wore neat, tidy, and simple outfits with a Celestia pin on them. A few approached the family to welcome them, and some even offered to sit with them and guide them through the proceedings. Cricket didn't want to come off as rude, but thankfully his wife took the initiative to politely decline any offers for company.\n\nThe sermon they had expected turned out not to be a sermon at all, but instead a brief speech from a Senior Lodger who affirmed her faith in Celestia's perfection. She then invited the congregation to share their "Thoughts and Testimonies" and left the pulpit open for any to approach it.\n\nOver the next hour, roughly a dozen ponies of all kinds stepped forward to speak of how impactful the Friendship Lodge has been on their life, how much more confident they've become since devoting themselves to Celestia, and how blessed they are to have a living goddess to look up to. Truthfully, Cricket found himself paying more attention to the clock than to the speakers, but the last pony to step up immediately caught his attention: It was his squadmate, a pegasus who served alongside him at the beginning of the Lunar Civil War.\n\nCricket was utterly transfixed on the stallion who had once sworn his life to serve Nightmare Moon. A stallion who was dead set on becoming a Moonspeaker. A stallion who had gagged at the mention of Celestia's name. A stallion who was now crying tears of joy while speaking of how wrong he was in the past and how thankful he was for the Friendship Lodge's forgiveness, even when he had spent years fighting against Celestia.\n\nWhen the service was over, Cricket Chirp felt a new sensation in his heart: Desire. He wanted to know more— No, he needed to know more. What could change a pony like that?"

Seated in the rear of one of the Friendship Lodge's weekly congregations, they were the only bat ponies present. The only Lunarists present. He recalled how apprehensive he was when they first set hoof into the Lodge, having only shown up because they were promised that they would be given food and water — something that was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain if you were not a member of the Lodge. Cricket and his wife had initially sworn to resist their new government's policies, but their resolve crumbled when their young foals began to show signs of malnutrition. Now they were here in the pews amongst "Celestia's" faithful.\n\nIn stark contrast to his family's dark, moon-themed clothing, the members of the Friendship Lodge all word neat, tidy, and simple outfits with a Celestia pin on them. A few approached the family to welcome them, but their kind greetings seemed to be veiled with judgment, as if they had finally made the "correct" decision to join them in worship of their goddess.\n\nThe sermon they had expected turned out not to be a sermon at all, but instead a brief speech from a Senior Lodger who affirmed her faith in Celestia's perfection. She then invited the congregation to share their "Thoughts and Testimonies" and left the pulpit open for any to approach it.\n\nOver the next hour, roughly a dozen ponies of all kinds approached the pulpit to speak of how impactful the Friendship Lodge has been on their life, how much more confident they've become since devoting themselves to Celestia, and how blessed they are to have a living goddess to look up to. As time went on, Cricket found himself becoming more and more on edge as many of the speakers condemned the princess of the night and her followers. However, it wasn't until the last speaker stood up that he truly became horrified.\n\nShe was a thestral, like himself. She started by mentioning her late husband, whom Cricket recognized as his former squadmate who served alongside him in the Lunar Civil War. She said that he had started on the path to redemption, but he was struggling to abandon his old ways. She said that she was forced to leave him and take her foals with her so that she could accept Celestia's light. That she found a new husband. That they've never been happier.\n\nDespite the circumstances with her family and his being very different, he found himself tightly gripping his wife's hoof. He tried to steal a glance at her, and she at him, but the confidence they sought in each other seemed to be replaced by fear of what might or might not happen."

Having been granted the position of inquisitor, he had seen all sorts of ponies emerge from the woodwork to serve the Empress, ponies with a fiery resolve to do what must be done in Her name.\n\nBut this...\n\nThe Solar Inquisitor stood at a distance as he observed ponies in white shirts and ties help organize a relief effort in Baltimare after an apartment complex had collapsed. They were giving out meal packages, camping supplies, and so on to the various families that had been affected by their homes' destruction. While this was not out of the ordinary for what he had heard of this "Friendship Lodge", he noticed that some of the families receiving aid were thestrals. Thestrals who were wearing clothing that clearly gave away their Lunarist beliefs.\n\nWood Chip looked around. Did nopony else see the problem with this? Why were they giving aid to Lunarists of all ponies? He examined one of the Friendship Lodge ponies who was speaking with a thestral and his family. The overly cheery mare seemed very concerned with the well-being of those before her, making sure to give them extra supplies and even offering a hug to one of the younger ones. The interaction concluded with the family thanking her and walking off, though Wood noted that among the supplies they held was the signature book that the Friendship Lodge missionaries were known for carrying.\n\nWhat is going on?! Wood stood dumbstruck as he tried to process what was happening. We don't convert Lunarists, we purge them! This isn't Solarism... he didn't know what this was! His mind was screaming at him that this was wrong, that he should alert the Empress to what was happening in the Southeast, but everypony here just seemed so... genuine.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a hymn being sung in praise of Celestia. That was another thing he found baffling: Why do they always refer to Daybreaker as Celestia?! There was just so much that he didn't understand about this group...\n\n"Hey mister inquisitor, you look on edge," A young missionary startled Wood as they offered their holy book to him, "Do you need the words of Celestia and Her Faithful Student to comfort you?""

Those ponies, upon realizing that they were about to aid Lunarists, retracted their supplies and started shouting at them. Wood could make out a few words - "Confess!" "Repent!", "Humble yourselves!". Some of the Lunarists argued with the volunteers but quickly realized that no supplies would be given if they didn't adhere to their benefactor's demands. Some turned tail and stormed off, but many others remained.\n\nOne of the volunteers produced the signature book they were known for carrying and began to read from it. She forced the Lunarists to repeat after her, and those who did were given supplies along with a copy of the Friendship Lodge's holy book. She concluded her preaching by telling them that they would be visited in the future and that they were expected to be able to recite scripture from memory if they wanted to continue receiving help.\n\nWood stood dumbstruck as he tried to process what had just happened.

 daring_solar.23.desc:0 "Good Word was reading in his study when he heard a noise that had become all too familiar to him: the cocking of a pistol. Without rising from his seat or turning to see who was behind him, he spoke, "Careful now, you wouldn't want to make any mistakes."\n\n"It won't be a mistake, it will be justice." The voice trembled with rage.\n\n"Are you so sure?" Good Word set down his book, "Justice can become a mistake with hindsight. I am very familiar with the concept, as I have made many decisions that I've come to regret." Instead of responding, the pony behind him slowly circled around into Good Word's field of view. He was a young thestral adorned in a bloodstained Chiropterran Legionary uniform with bullet holes aplenty, likely taken from a deceased parent. Good Word's eyes darted from his clothes, to his pistol, and then into his eyes that betrayed the fear behind his fury. "Why are you really here?"\n\nThe thestral grit his teeth and screamed, "BECAUSE I HATE YOU AND EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR!" The trigger for the pistol was pulled slightly, but not enough to fire the bullet.\n\n"I understand. I would hate me too if I stood where you stand. But this is not a path that you want to walk. I have known the anger you feel now. I never thought myself a killer, yet my anger made me into a monster." Good Word rose from his chair and took a step towards the thestral, "But in time I overcame that anger-\n\n"NOT ANOTHER STEP!" The thestral fired his pistol, but his shaking grip caused the bullet to whiz past Good Word's head.\n\n"-and I know that you can overcome that anger too. Don't let it destroy you as it almost destroyed me." Another step. And another.\n\nTears streamed from the thestral's eyes. "STOP IT! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!"\n\nGood Word was right in front of the stallion. "It's all right." He raised a hoof and gently pushed aside the pistol, then hugged the shaking thestral, "I'm sorry about what happened to your kin, I truly am. But you need to move on, or you will never heal."\n\nThe thestral broke down sobbing as a millenia's worth of anger dissipated in Good Word's embrace."

 daring_solar.26.desc:0 "Just recently, an official emissary of [CES.GetNameDef] arrived in Canterlot to petition the Empress regarding their desire to punish Chiropterra for their crimes against the Empire. While they showed the utmost respect for the Empress and her staff, they seemed to be filled with great reverence, more so than the majority of her subjects in the Empire at large.\n\nTheir request was simple, but not inconsequential: They wished for a percentage of the Solar Empire's navy to be transferred to the Southeast for use in helping the Empress' light "shine over the sea."\n\nWhile Daybreaker planned to make Chiropterra suffer, she was still busy consolidating her control over Equus. Perhaps an investment into her most devoted subjects could pay dividends... they could deliver the Lunarist holdout to her on a silver platter. Although parting with that many ships might prove disastrous if her enemies took advantage of her split navy.\n\nIn the end, she had a choice to make."

Not that he wasn't already planning on doing exactly that.\n\nThe bandaged earth pony set the letter down as he picked up the telephone to call his naval officers. There would of course be paperwork to fill out, but he thought it best to give them the good news first." #1 carrier, 2 battleships, 2 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, 8 destroyers

 daring_solar.30.desc:0 "Good Word tentatively looked out of the sky chariot that was transporting him to Canterlot. The city wasn't too far away now - it looked truly magnificent under the radiance of the sun. He thought back to the letter that he had received: a direct invitation to come to Canterlot to speak with Empress Daybreaker regarding his "recent conduct." While he intended to leave as soon as possible, he did not expect a sizable Solar Guard escort to show up at his doorstep mere minutes after the letter had arrived.\n\nSoon his entourage arrived in the city proper. They landed just outside of the castle entrance, then informed Good Word that the Empress was waiting inside. He thanked them, then looked up at the double doors emblazoned with the sun. He began to feel apprehensive, which was an unfamiliar sensation. He'd spent his whole life teaching others about Celestia, yet he had never met her before...\n\nHe eventually summoned the courage to go inside. The castle interior was just as wondrous as he had imagined. Glass murals adorned the walls and ceiling, while exquisite banners and other brightly colored decor perfectly complemented the interior. Good Word respectfully kept his hooves to himself as he approached the throne room.\n\nThe guards nodded as they opened the doors, and in the earth pony went. The first thing he noticed was how big the room was - it was larger than the entire Grand Lodge building. The second was the lack of any additional guards. The third was a white pony with a fiery, flowing mane and stern gaze sitting atop a throne. His heart skipped a beat as he saw her looking at him. He immediately bowed as all of his rehearsed greetings seemed to slip away from him.\n\n"Rise," Daybreaker commanded, "I have watched you carefully over these past few years. Repeatedly I have had doubts as to whether or not the Southeast was capable of running itself while adhering to my laws. What kind of society they would build? What kind of pony would lead them? Now I see the results of these things laid before me.""

This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours bears much resemblance to many cults that Celestia had put down over the centuries."

"We followed your teachings and sought to spread the truth of your divinity to all who would hear it."\n\nShe laughed again, "But you did not follow my teachings. You followed Celestia's teachings."\n\nThat caused the stoic earth pony's head to tilt. "I... you are Celestia, though?" Good Word asked, somewhat confused.\n\nHer gaze bored into him. "Because you have done so well, I will forgive that misconception. I'm the better, prettier, and more powerful version of Celestia." She made a dramatic show of extending the flames in her mane. "However, I will also humor you. You and your Lodge may continue to call me Celestia, despite the... unorthodox beliefs you hold."\n\nGood Word stared at her for a moment, then nodded once more. "I see." He stopped for a moment, "Is there anything else that I and the Friendship Lodge can do for you?"\n\nDaybreaker grinned exultantly, "Why, yes. You have all proven yourselves to be devout servants, and I am not above recognizing you as such. Therefore, I am hereby granting you full autonomy to serve me as you see fit, rather than to be subject to the examinations and red tape of my bureaucracy. After all, they aren't half as faithful as you are."\n\n"Thank you, Goddess Celestia."\n\nShe waved her hoof to dismiss him. Just as he was about to exit the room, she called out, "One more thing: This 'religion' of yours.

 daring_shadow.1.desc:0 ""Are you all out of your minds?!" Daring Do practically shouted at the ponies making up her parliament. Said ponies were shuffling in their seats. Clearly, none wanted to speak out against the mare who had fought so hard to get them to where they are now.\n\n"Well," One stallion resigned himself by standing up, "With due respect Commander, we can't go against the princess after all that she's done for Equestria."\n\nDaring stomped her hoof in frustration. "That's not our princess anymore! She literally burned some of her own ponies to death for questioning her authority! Does that sound like Celestia to you?!"\n\nHer heart sunk when the stallion and the rest of parliament seemed to hesitate before answering her. "...She was probably just defending herself against Nightmareist agents." The stallion sighed, "Commander, we're tired. We don't want to fight each other again. We're all Equestrians, even Celestia with her new... look."\n\n"I can't believe this. What happened to you all? Where are the ponies who fought so hard with me to restore harmony to the southeast?"\n\n"We haven't abandoned harmony, Commander. Harmony has just changed, and so has Celestia, or Daybreaker as she now calls herself." The stallion paused, then tried to appeal to Daring Do. "You know as well as we do that Equestria will never be the same again. But we still believe in harmony. We just need to have faith that the princess will do what is best for us."\n\n"If this is what harmony is, then I want no part of it!" Daring ripped off the emblem of Celestia's cutie mark adorning her uniform, "I'M LEAVING!"\n\nThere were audible gasps as Daring Do stormed off and slammed the door shut behind her."

 daring_shadow.2.desc:0 ""Hey! Wait up!"\n\nDaring Do sighed in resignation as she stopped. How ironic was it that the only pony who followed her was the one that she liked the least?\n\nQuibble Pants just about collapsed as he finally caught up with her. "You gotta... stop moving... so fast..." He haphazardly reached for his canteen and gulped down the entire thing, then wiped the sweat from his brow, "So... where are we going precisely?"\n\n"There is no 'we', I was going to look for something to stop Daybreaker. You can go back to your cushy desk job, Quibble."\n\nHe scoffed, "Oh please, 'A.K. Yearling', ever since 'Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers', the quality of your adventures have fallen off of, well, a tower. Hence why I am here to 'assist' you so that your next book will hopefully be as good as the original trilogy."\n\nDaring Do groaned in exasperation, "Why are you so concerned with my books at a time like this?! Both of the princesses have gone insane!"\n\n"I don't pay attention to politics."\n\nShe resisted the urge to throw a stick at him. "You know what? Fine. If you wanna help so much, then you tell me: What magical artifact can defeat an alicorn? Specifically the one in charge of raising the sun?"\n\nQuibble rolled his eyes. "Easy: The Staff of Sacanas. I read about it in one of the documentaries about the Storm King. It's supposed to be able to steal the magic of an alicorn and leave them powerless, but he never found it."\n\nDaring's ears perked up. "Wow, that was actually useful information. Where is it?"\n\n"I don't know, he never found it."\n\nShe threw a stick at him."

Quibble Pants chuckled as he unfolded the expensive scroll that Daring Do had purchased after painstakingly tracking down a trader who knew of the Staff of Sacanas, "I've already examined it. The design is overly complex, the instructions needlessly cryptic, and worst of all, it-"\n\n"Just give it here!" Daring Do swiped the map away from his hooves and looked over it. "Hmm... the map says that the temple which houses the staff is located somewhere north of Tenochtitlan." She scratched her muzzle, "That's odd, I thought I'd already explored all of the temples in that area..."\n\n"As I was saying," Quibble swiped the map back, "It's completely useless. This just leads to the same place where you found the Sapphire Stone! Which, mind you, is still your best book."\n\nDaring grumbled as she yanked the scroll away again and rolled it up, "Do you have anything better to complain about than the quality of my books?!"\n\n"Well, for starters, the-"\n\n"That was a rhetorical question!"\n\nQuibble narrowed his eyes, then shrugged. "Fine. I guess we'll do things your way. Because your way no doubt includes traversing several dangerous parts of the jungle, evading lots of traps, solving puzzles, and countless other wastes of our time in search of a place you've already been to."\n\nAfter a moment of indecision, Daring grit her teeth and swallowed her pride. "And do you know a better way to find the staff?"\n\nHer companion's smug aura mocked her. "I thought you'd never ask.""

 daring_shadow.4.t:0 "The Temple of Tired Tropes" #podrick
 daring_shadow.4.desc:0 "In time, Daring Do and Quibble Pants made their way to the temple which supposedly held the Staff of Sacanas. When it became apparent that the temple was indeed the same place that Daring had found the Sapphire Stone years ago, she prepared to turn around, but Quibble insisted that they check anyways "just to be sure." And thus they found themselves scaling the stairs of the temple.\n\n"Did we really have to come here in the middle of the night? You know that nighttime adventures least triple the chances that something bad will happen to us, right?" Quibble glanced up towards the full moon and pointed to it in exasperation, "Quadruples it!"\n\nDaring sighed for perhaps the hundredth time since she'd begun this journey. "I told you already, Daybreaker needs to be stopped! For all we know, her brainwashed ponies could be after us! Who knows how much time we have until they find us?"\n\n"Why would they be looking for us, though?" Quibble complained, "I haven't done anything! And the only thing you did was quit your job!"\n\nDaring elected to ignore him as they made their way into the temple itself. To their surprise, the traps hadn't been reset despite the years between Daring's last visit and now. As they traversed the eerily silent structure, they couldn't help but feel a little bit unnerved by how little resistance they had met throughout their entire journey. Even as they reached the core of the temple, there was naught but silence to greet them.\n\nQuibble tentatively glanced at the map that he had been so critical of earlier. "It says that what we seek is 'within the shrine of the Sapphire Stone'." He looked around at the intricate, yet neglected room. "Well, we're here and I don't see it."\n\nDaring trotted up to the pedestal that she had taken the Sapphire Stone from years ago. She carefully examined it, then noticed something odd: The frame of the pedestal seemed loose. With some effort, she hefted the top of the pedestal off, revealing a hole that extended far downwards. She glanced back and smirked at her companion. "It said 'within' the shrine, Quibble." He rolled his eyes in response.\n\nShe tied a rope to a nearby pillar and descended into the hole. As she reached the bottom, she noticed a faint, ghostly light emanating from what looked like a peculiar stone in front of her. She began to reach out towards it."

There was no up, no down, no sense of direction at all. While she was used to being in stressful situations, this was unlike anything she'd ever experienced before. "H-Hello!?"\n\nA distorted voice answered her. "Impressive work, Daring Do."\n\nShe whipped her head around but could see no source of the unnerving voice. "Who's there?! Show yourself!" Daring continued to look around, only to see a bone-chilling shadowy face with shining white holes for eyes staring at her where there wasn't one before. "Who... what are you?!"\n\nThe being seemed to chuckle. "Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can offer you. You came to me because you need help, Daring Do. I can sense it." The face swiveled around her with unnatural speed, closing in next to her ear. "What is it that that you need help with so desperately?"\n\nWhile her gut was screaming at her not to trust whatever this thing was, she decided to play along to see if she could find a way out of this ominous place. "I... I was looking for a way to turn Daybreaker back into Celestia."\n\n"Hmm..." The being retreated slightly, "That is a large need. Too large. It is beyond my power."\n\nAt that remark, Daring simply shrugged. "Hey, you asked."\n\n"But what if..." The being rose above her, "There was something else? Something... deeper than that desire? Something you have wanted since the very beginning?"\n\nDaring thought back on the past few years. Equestria had practically exploded into a cacophony of bloodshed and violence that ordinary ponies could never have comprehended. So many innocents had been forever scarred by the horrors of war. Even the alicorns had gone mad. She opened her eyes and stared at the being again. "I want peace. I want Equestria to be at peace."\n\n"I can grant you the power to do this, Daring Do." The being extended a shadowy protrusion out in front of her, "Equestria at peace. A difficult task, but it can be done. All you have to do is... Let. Me. In."\n\nDespite the sinking feeling in her heart, she wanted nothing more than to see Equestria be free of war and tyranny. She grasped the being's tentacle."

This... what's happening around us is its doing, I know it. We should have left when we had the chance."\n\nMage Meadowbrook turned away from one of her many patients to address her young friend, "Maybe we should have, Stygian, but we didn't. We stayed because we help ponies in need." She picked up an herb and placed it over her patient's nose, then gestured to the dozens of other ponies, all of which had expressions of terror frozen on their faces, laying in stretchers and makeshift beds across her improvised underground hospital. "And right now, these ponies need us."\n\nStygian shuffled his hooves around uncomfortably, "I know, it's just... you're a Pillar. If you and the others could meet up again, you could banish the Pony of Shadows into Limbo again!"\n\n"Don't you remember what happened when you were saved from the Pony of Shadows, Stygian? It wasn't us who saved you, it was the magic of friendship. And nobody knows friendship better than Twilight Sparkle and her friends. I'm sure that they'll be able to handle this. Now be a dear and fetch me some more herbs from the back, please."\n\n"If you say so..." Stygian left to head into the supply closet. He rummaged around the area, then sighed. They were running low on herbs again, which meant another excursion outside. He was searching through the last container when he heard what sounded like the shattering of wood. The shelter door! He turned to leave, but then he heard a sharp cry. All of the candles went out, plunging the hospital into absolute darkness. He pressed himself against a wall and held his breath. If Meadowbrook was in trouble...\n\n...Stygian cursed himself. He wanted to help her, but he also never wanted to see the Pony of Shadows ever again. More than anyone else, he know what that monster was capable of when it gets its hooves on somepony. He sunk down to the ground and began to sulk. What could he even hope to do against it? He didn't even know if Star Swirl had gotten his letter for help after he had gone traveling around the world to learn more about friendship."

If it is destroyed, no matter, I have countless more.\n\n---\n\nMy shard moves swiftly. It arrives at the entrance of a cavern. The Everfree's dangers are plentiful, but they cannot harm it. Without delay, my shard enters the cavern. My shard moves swiftly. There are multiple paths. It selects one at random and follows it. There is a bright light in the distance. My shard moves swiftly.\n\nThe Tree is ahead. My shard spots two ponies guarding it with ground-mounted automatic weapons. They open fire. My shard moves swiftly. My shard twists and bends its form as it advances on them, avoiding most of their fire. One appendage reforms into a blade. It slices one of the weapons apart. My shard moves swiftly. It leaps at the other weapon. A mistake. The weapon lands multiple consecutive hits into my shard. It is not enough. My shard is damaged, but it regenerates almost instantaneously. My shard moves swiftly. It slices the other weapon. The two ponies draw their sidearms. My shard moves swiftly. It envelops the two ponies. They are incapacitated. I pay no mind to their expressions of terror. My host restricts me from killing them outright.\n\nMy shard advances towards the Tree of Harmony. It is a strange thing. So ornate, yet its magic is invisible to me. Nevertheless, my shard touches it. My shard hugs it. My shard melts into it. The tree changes color.\n\nAs long as I am intact, the Tree of Harmony shall be rendered inert."

Pockets of survivors who persisted despite the dark fog.\n\nShe had considered going after them multiple times, but their status truly did not matter, she only needed to ensure that enough of them were incapacitated that she could achieve her goal.\n\nThe pony focused on a larger town, not too far from her. That one was... unfortunate. She never intended to kill any of them, nor anycreature else for that matter, but regrettably some accidents had occurred while others had taken their own lives before she could place them into her dark trance. This town had all gathered and collectively committed the unthinkable shortly before her arrival. It made her sad. Didn't they understand what she was doing? Why she was doing it?\n\nShe tried so hard to stop the others from running, but she had come to accept that it was simply not possible to prevent so many from fleeing across the ocean, especially as the Shadow seemed reluctant to travel across large bodies of water.\n\nNow with all threats to Equestria neutralized, all areas of Equestria secured, and all of its remaining inhabitants accounted for... it was time for her to complete her mission.

Her hooves began to shake as all of the memories of what had occurred over the past several years flooded back into her. Daring grasped her head and screamed as she realized what she had just done.\n\n---\n\nA couple of days had passed since Daring first woke up. Currently, she was sitting on a rather comfy rock near an isolated farm. She figured that the Shadow was either gone or missing, since the shroud over Equestria had vanished. She'd wandered aimlessly, not sure of what to do with herself. It gave her a lot of time to reflect on some mysteries. Her experience with... using... the Shadow had given her a lot of insight on the inner workings of magic.\n\nThe Sapphire Stone in her first book wasn't magical, that much she knew. So that mysterious blue light beneath the temple must have been from the real one, and she had taken a decoy earlier. She had deduced that the Sapphire Stone allowed its user to peer into alternate planes of existence, but when not attuned properly, it might only show the places between planes...\n\n...and when she peered into Limbo, the Shadow hitched a ride with her back into the real world. Daring grimaced. If she hadn't bargained with that thing, then maybe she could have found another way to defeat Daybreaker and restore peace to Equestria. But it's too late for that now. Even if she did find a way to bring everycreature back from Limbo... she didn't have magic anymore. There was also all of the ones who... didn't make it.\n\nShe hopped off of the rock and began to walk again."

He made the cutest faces in his sleep, though she would never tell him that.\n\nShe stepped outside and was greeted by the quaint peace of her village. The occasional chirp in the jungle could be heard, though not many ponies were up and about at this early hour. Mazatl made her way over to the water basin and began her daily cleansing ritual. She hummed as she washed herself, then noticed something odd: All of the wildlife noises had gone quiet. Mazatl paused for several seconds. This wasn't just weird, it was... unnatural. She hastily climbed out of the basin and listened very carefully.\n\nSilence.\n\nA growing pit formed in her stomach as she galloped back to her village. Something was wrong, something was very wrong.\n\nMazatl noticed that the jungle was becoming darker as she sped between the vines and trees. What was going on?!

She stumbled and slipped over many obstacles, but eventually, she felt the mud bricks of her hut and felt a surge of relief flow through her as she made her way inside.\n\nShe called out for her lover, but nobody answered.

The bullets seemed to disintegrate the creature briefly, but they weren't enough; it swiftly reformed itself and resumed its relentless march.\n\n"Mild! We have to retreat!" called out Steam Vent from a nearby fortification. He had no idea what he and his wife had gotten into when they had both volunteered to defend the city, but he knew he had to keep her safe. He would never forgive himself if he let her...\n\nShe didn't seem to hear him. "YOU WON'T TAKE MY HOME YOU MONSTERS!" she screamed as she dumped her magazine into the creature, but to no avail. The echo of the empty click rang louder than the continuous barrage of heavy weapons fire occurring throughout their defensive line. She cursed and briefly took her gaze off the creature to reload her weapon.\n\n"MILD! GET BACK NOW!" her husband shouted. But by the time she had readied her weapon again, it was too late. The almost incorporeal creature of shadow spread out its tendrils and enveloped the mare. Steam screamed in terror and swiveled his machine gun around to unload it into the beast, praying desperately that it would be enough. An unnatural howl emerged from the creature as the firepower from the machine gun seemed to be enough to destroy it. It released its grip on the mare as its shadowy form was ripped to shreds.\n\nSteam let go of his weapon and practically threw himself over the fortifications to check on his wife. First, he felt relief at seeing her chest still rising. His relief quickly melted away into horror as he saw her face: Frozen in shock, her eyes wide; it seemed like she wasn't there at all. Steam performed a basic medical check, only to discover that whatever the creature had done to her, it had rendered her comatose. He looked around in preparation to carry her to safety, but his heart sank when he saw dozens more of those same shadow creatures enveloping the rest of his defensive line. He looked back down at his wife and apologized to her, but before he could rise, another shadow was already upon him."

He shuddered as he recalled one unfortunate pony hyperventilating until their heart gave out.\n\nThis didn't bode well for his psyche, as he was barely able to run faster than the shroud that kept encroaching on the land behind him. He had only just reached Tenochtitlan barely an hour before the darkness had spread that far, giving him only a brief moment to pause and catch his breath.\n\nHow could he have been so stupid? The Sapphire Stone in the first Daring Do book wasn't magical, that much was clear... therefore, it must have been a decoy. It was obvious now that the real Sapphire Stone was still in the temple, and that it held magical powers of some kind. But what? He thought back to the traveling merchant from Saddle Arabia that Daring Do had bought the map from. The merchant's accent was rather heavy... it was possible that the language barrier resulted in them selling Daring Do a way to -find- the Staff of Sacanas rather than a map that led directly to it.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter now. Quibble glanced behind him only to see a faint, but towering shadowy monstrosity approaching in the distance. His incredibly sore legs complained at having to move again, but he had no choice. He had to get away. He had to run, for that was all anypony could do now."

 daring_shadow.17.desc:0 ""We have to get out of here! Can't you heard the evacuation sirens?!" Crescent Glow shouted as she quickly threw some supplies into a bag.\n\n"Celestia will save me." Good Word replied calmly as he stared at a small picture of the fair princess of the sun.\n\nCrescent paused, dumbfounded. "Are you... have you lost your mind?! Equestria is being overrun by this thing! We have to get to the coast, NOW!"\n\n"If I have faith in Her, then She will protect me." Good Word bowed his head down in reverence, though his shaking hooves betrayed his real emotions.\n\nCrescent felt a pang in her heart, but she didn't have time to be careful about his feelings. "Celestia's gone, and you know it. Daybreaker's just a twisted version of her, like Nightmare Moon is to Luna. And if we aren't on a boat in the next twenty minutes, something much worse than either of them is going to be here."\n\n"I... I..." Good Word started, then he looked up towards Crescent, "...you're right. I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough to be her-"\n\nShe yanked him up off of the ground, "Cut the faith-talk, we both deserve better than some preachy 'empresses' who never learned how to play nice together as fillies. Now let's get out of here."\n\n---\n\nBy the time the two ponies had made it onto an evacuation ship, the shadowy cloud had encompassed over half of the city. Although they had doubts as to whether or not she would have been able to do anything about this monstrous entity, they both wished that Daring Do was here to help them."

 daring_shadow.18.t:0 "Shadow Of The Sun" #SOL capitulation to CES - Daybreaker defeated
 daring_shadow.18.desc:0 "While Canterlot had fallen to the Shadow Realm long ago, the castle itself remained protected under an extremely potent magical shield that had preserved it from the Pony of Shadows... until now, that was.\n\nFrom the darkness, a pony emerged. She looked at the shield protecting the castle and raised her hoof up against it. Surprisingly, it passed through as if there was no barrier at all. She pressed another hoof forward, and another, and when her body was halfway through, she gasped, as if the full weight of her actions had been realized all at once. "No!" she shouted. Before she could do anything further, shadowy tendrils inched up her body and enveloped her again. "YES," said the pony, who then proceeded into the castle.\n\nThe door to the throne room burst open, and the pony was met with a wave of searing heat. "Oh, it's *you*. You, who have brought ruin upon my Empire. You, who have condemned millions of my little ponies to die. You, who dares to intrude on the place I call home? There isn't a punishment worthy for all that you have done!"\n\n"DAYBREAKER. YOU. DID. THIS." Shadowy limbs emerged from the pony's body and rushed towards the fiery alicorn. Daybreaker ignited her horn and sliced apart the shadows with ease. The pony knelt down and screamed as an unending number of tendrils manifested themselves and tried to reach for Daybreaker.\n\nAs it became clear that she could not cut the shadows faster than they appeared, the Empress of Ponykind focused her magic into a blindingly bright ball of light and threw it down at the pony. The shadow attacks ceased as it collided with the pony. "Hmph," Daybreaker smirked, "When there are no shadows left, only my glory remains."\n\n"THERE IS ALWAYS DARKNESS BEHIND LIGHT," Suddenly, Daybreaker felt dozens of tendrils wrap themselves around her. She tried to ignite her horn again, but they seemed to halt her flow of magic. Her confidence vanished instantaneously as she looked around for the source of the tendrils, only to discover that she herself was casting a shadow from her miniature sun spell. The pony emerged from that shadow. "YOU TOOK A PEACEFUL EQUESTRIA AWAY FROM ME. NOW I SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM EQUESTRIA." A small, multicolored portal opened up next to her.\n\nDaybreaker struggled against her bonds, but to no avail. She let out a muffled cry as she was dragged away into Limbo."

 CES_pony_of_shadows_desc:0 "§YDate of Creation§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: Brought into existence by the Umbrum, the Pony of Shadows was to be their greatest weapon against Ponykind. Its magical abilities were unparalleled, but like any tool, it needed someone to wield it. The Umbrum desired for King Sombra to use their superweapon to transform all of Equestria into a realm that they could inhabit. But before they could set their plan in motion, a young pony named Stygian took the reins of the Pony of Shadows and was subsequently banished by the Pillars of Equestria into Limbo, a place between worlds. The Umbrum considered their weapon lost, then moved onto other machinations.\n\nA thousand years later, the Elements of Harmony brought the Pony of Shadows back into reality, but tore away its host before banishing it back into Limbo. Now it has returned yet again, though the exact method to how it did so remains a mystery.\n\nThe Pony of Shadows is not truly sapient; it warps the desires of its host in order to complete both its original purpose and the goal of the pony that wields it. Its host may not even be fully aware of their actions as they pursue their goals. Unfortunately for most ponies, that goal involves the complete and utter annihilation of society as they know it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"
