 ### Characters

 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen"
 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid_desc:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon has a heritage of over a thousand years, so expectations have always been high for him, especially as he is the grandson of the famous Queen Mewodora the Second who restored the dynasty to the throne of Abyssinia. He was raised in the royal palace of Panthera and his father King Mawkonnen ensured he was given the best education money could buy, which prepared him for his future as his heir. As a student, he was proficient, even if lacking in passion, and excelled at economics, mathematics and history. Already at a young age he fell in love with his cousin Morticia, but was unable to marry her for a long time due to cousin marriage being strongly frowned upon. When Mawkonnen died in 998 ALB, Gomez was more than ready to succeed him and, with his royal authority, was able to immediately marry Morticia. He was fully aware of the many potential problems that threatened Abyssinia, and planned to deal with them before it was too late.\n\nUnfortunately, black cats aren't known for their luck.\n\nAs soon as news of the Storm King's rapid conquests arrived, Gomez began preparing defences and building up the royal army. But despite his best efforts, he had no counter to his airships and Abyssinia's cities fell one by one. In the end, when Panthera burned and he had lost a part of his right ear, he finally surrendered, offering his crown to the Storm King. But just as quickly as he had arrived, the Storm King left, leaving behind a devastated, impoverished kingdom.\n\nWith his dreams shattered and his kingdom on the brink of collapse, Gomez's mental state worsened rapidly as he was unable to cope with the stress. Time will tell if he is able to recover and face his daunting challenges."
 ABY_slave_leader:0 "Sharp Spear"
 ABY_slave_leader_desc:0 "Sharp Spear was a young soldier in the Maregyptian army when the Manedalusian War broke out in 988. In the fervor of nationalism that followed the Kingdom's proclamation of independence from Saddle Arabia, she eagerly went to fight in the frontline against the perfidious felines. Yet in the chaos of battle, she was wounded and taken prisoner by the enemy. Not long after a ceasefire was declared, and like many other prisoners of war, she was enslaved.\n\nAs a healthy and able-bodied pegasus mare, she was a valuable slave and changed owners several times. She ended up working at a coffee plantation in the highlands of Catorahe, where she befriended a zebra slave called Bontu. Their owner was a cruel aristocat who saw them as little more than property and treated them poorly. Bontu warned that many escapee slaves died quickly, but Sharp Spear did not heed her warning and managed to escape the plantation, promising to one day return and free her friend.\n\nSurviving alone was difficult, but she eventually met a group of other runaway slaves. They lived a life of aimless banditry, seeking to do nothing more than to survive. But Sharp Spear was burning with ambition. She convinced the group to conduct raids to free other slaves and increase their numbers, while also contacting other groups of rebellious slaves. Within years, she had become a leader of thousands of slaves who desired nothing more than to keep their freedom. Yet it was not enough for her to free all slaves. To avoid repeating the past, she dreamt of making Abyssinia a better place that could be a friend to Maregypt: a nation where all races were equal, all property was shared and all decisions were made by democratic votes. It remains to be seen if she can make her dream into a reality."
 ABY_catrina_catwe:0 "Catrina Tabby"
 ABY_catrina_catwe_desc:0 "Catrina is a direct descendant of the Catwe kings and queens who once ruled Abyssinia for two hundred years. While this makes her technically a noble, she has no special legal privileges or formal status as the Clawomons stripped her family of any such things. Nevertheless, she is far more wealthy and influential than any mere common cat. While her relatives were kept in check by a strong central government, Catrina was able to use the recent chaos as a ladder to climb up in Abyssinian society. With many blaming the Clawomons for the numerous problems that plagued the Kingdom, she proposed herself as a tempting alternative. The nobles were especially dissatisfied with the Clawomons due to their modernizing reforms, and many of them quickly rallied behind Catrina, as out of all pretenders to the throne, she has by far the strongest claim to it.\n\nBut Catrina has no intention of being a mere lackey of the nobles. The invasion of the Storm King opened up her eyes to a simple truth of life: it is better to be among the mighty than caged at someone's command. Abyssinia had long been dominated by foreign powers and other races, but she had ambitious plans that would change everything. Underneath her family mansion, she conducts secret experiments that may well change the fate of catkind forever..."
 ABY_catra_meowmeow:0 "Catra Meowmeow"
 ABY_queen_morticia:0 "Morticia Addisu"
 ABY_queen_morticia_desc:0 "Being born as a daughter of King Mawkonnen's sister Addisu meant that Morticia was privileged from the start as one of the members of the House of Clawomon. Yet unlike some of her relatives, she never let it inflate her ego. A kittenhood friendship with a servant ensured she'd feel empathy for those who were deemed "commoners" in Abyssinian society. After her mother's death, she used her inherited wealth for philanthropy and buying freedom for slaves owned by the Kingdom's nobility. While she had to firmly stand her ground against most of her family, her cousin Gomez admired her generosity and kindness. As the two lived under the same roof, they had long been familiar with each other. However, it came as a shock to their relatives when they announced that they were lovers. Gomez's father King Mawkonnen disapproved of the relationship and forbade their marriage. The two had to wait until his death to finally hold a private wedding ceremony by themselves. Thus, Morticia became Queen consort of Abyssinia.\n\nDespite the controversy with her husband and the fact that the nobility look down upon her, Morticia is very popular among the common cats. This is because she genuinely cares for their well-being and, thanks to her confidence, acts as the public face of the monarchy while Gomez is more withdrawn. Nevertheless, some radicals still believe she is just acting or pretending and that she only gave out wealth to increase her own popularity and influence."
 ABY_nathaniel_claw:0 "Nathaniel Claw"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen:0 "Dejen Rees-Moggy"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen_desc:0 "Ever since being a kitten, Dejen has been fascinated with statecraft. He was born to a middle-class family and his parents poured all their savings to afford a good education for him. Thankfully, he was naturally gifted at absorbing and handling information, even if his peers saw him as distant and emotionless. As Abyssinia modernized, it started to develop a fledgling modern bureaucracy which was always in need of cats like Dejen, who loved nothing more than dull paperwork. Within a few years, King Mawkonnen recognized Dejen's talents and appointed him as the new Minister of the Pen, Tsehafe Taezaz. This made him the King's right-paw cat, who ensured all his commands would be fulfilled in practice. He served Mawkonnen for only a short time however before he passed away and his son Gomez inherited the throne. Despite all the difficulties during his reign, Dejen tolerated him and focused on doing his job. Yet after the Storm King's invasion broke Gomez's mind completely, he wondered if someone more competent could replace him. After all, he always cared more about Abyssinia than about the monarch."
 ABY_colonel_meow:0 "Meow Frown"
 ABY_colonel_meow_desc:0 "While formally being the General of the Crown Guard, Meow Frown is widely known as "The Colonel". He is the highest ranking professional soldier in the Kingdom, having served in the Guard for many years and proving his devotion to the Kingdom of Abyssinia. During the Storm King's invasion, he led the defence of Panthera and his forces inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy despite being outnumbered. The Crown Guard stood by Gomez's side even as he surrendered to the invader.\n\nOutside of his military career, Meow is known for holding the world record for longest cat fur. Despite his scowl, he is rather friendly off-duty, especially after he has drunk some of his favourite scotch."
 ABY_ras_tardar:0 "Tardar Sourpuss"
 ABY_ras_tardar_desc:0 "As Tsahife Lam, she is the second highest ranking military officer (see: "The Mesafint (And The Royalty) In A Nutshell"). Maintaining the role of the nobility as leaders of the military is a vital goal for her. She is known for her grumpy and pessimistic personality."
 ABY_maxwell_the_cat:0 "Maxwell the Cat"
 ABY_maxwell_the_cat_desc:0 "This non-sapient cat excels at loafing and spinning. It is also very carryable."
 ABY_big_floppa:0 "Gosha"
 ABY_big_floppa_desc:0 "This wild caracal is a big floppa."
 ABY_baron_humbert:0 "Humbert Temesgen"
 ABY_baron_humbert_desc:0 "For well over a decade, the Fit'awrari of Dimeti has served Abyssinia as a diplocat and foreign minister. His fiefdom contains Dire Pawa, which is the second largest city in the realm thanks to his progressive economic policies. He is intelligent and a skilled swordscat."
 ABY_ras_thurston:0 "Thurston Waffles"
 ABY_ras_thurston_desc:0 "The Ras of Tigeray can be described as a sycophant, always trying to earn the favour of the monarchy. This does not mean that he always approves of his liege's actions. In fact, he can protest quite loudly."
 ABY_catto:0 "Catto"

 ABY_MGY_ankha:0 "Ankha"
 ABY_MGY_ankha_desc:0 ""All that glitters is not gold.""
 ABY_rep:0 "Rep"
 ABY_rep_desc:0 "Rep is an unusual sight in Abyssinia. He is not a cat, but a wingless young adult dragon. Catrina, the female pretender to the throne of Abyssinia, has long been his closest friend, but Rep is growing concerned with her ever-growing ambitions and grand plans. He is nostalgic for simpler days when the two lived a happy life together. While Catrina becomes increasingly ruthless over time, Rep retains his sympathy and tries his best to protect others from Catrina's wrath."
 #Yet he is able to use magic to shapeshift into many forms like a changeling can, so his true race is a mystery to everyone except Catrina.
 ABY_the_patriot:0 "The Patriot"
 ABY_the_patriot_desc:0 "No one really knows who the Patriot is. His identity is a well-kept secret and he spends much of his time in hiding, refusing to make any public appearances. Somehow, he became the supreme leader of the Abyssinian Patriotic Front, a devout nationalist resistance movement, yet only the higher ranking members of the organization know how or why. Theories and rumours about him spread like wildfire. Some theorize he is in fact King Gomez, a few claim King Mawkonnen has risen from the dead, while others say he is a former notorious bandit and murderer turned freedom fighter. Whatever the truth is, it is clear the Patriot will use any methods possible to liberate Abyssinia and enact brutal vengeance upon the enemies of Abyssinia."
 ABY_random_clawomon:0 "Mewditu Mawyam"
 ABY_oc_general:0 "Clock Muraqie"
 ABY_oc_general_desc:0 "Clock Muraqie was born in the early 980s. Growing up in Coltoba, his upbringing was rough due a combination of the war between Abyssinia and Maregypt as well as the general unstability in the region. His family was lucky to not be enslaved during this time, allowing Clock to become a clockmaker and open a small shop in the mid-990s. When the Storm Kingdom invaded Abyssinia, Coltoba was not spared and Clock's shop was ransacked by yeti troops and set aflame. In a failed attempt to save whatever he could, he was caught in the fire. He survived, but was left with singed hair and coat.\n\nLeft impoverished, he had no choice but to become a slave to survive. Experiencing slavery firsthoof only made him hate it more when he faced mistreatment from his new owner. So when he heard rumours from other slaves of a brewing slave revolt, he was eager to help out. Using his knowledge of time from all the clock making he had done, he kept track of the schedules of the guards and his owner to just barely escape while the former were switching shifts and the latter was asleep. After a difficult journey through the countryside, he found other escaped slaves and eventually joined the larger rebel movement. His clockmaking and timekeeping abilities allowed several guerilla raid operations to be carried out successfully. Eventually he rose through the unofficial ranks of the slave army and became one of its leading figures."
 ABY_spymaster:0 "Mittens the Spymaster"
 ABY_spymaster_desc:0 "No one knows what she actually looks like."
 ABY_donkey_general:0 "Sennacherib"
 ABY_donkey_general_desc:0 "A proud Asstyrian donkey and a former soldier, who in his youth got into a heated argument that escalated into a hooffight. Afterwards he was sentenced into slavery for his crimes and was eventually sold to an Abyssinian noble to work on their coffee plantation. Despite spending several decades in slavery, he never submitted and endured harsh physical and psychological punishments for his disobedience. He attempted to escape several times, was recaptured, was punished, was sold off to another noble, and so on.\n\nWhen a group of slave rebels under Sharp Spear's command rescued him alongside many other slaves, he showed little gratitude, claiming that he was planning to escape again anyways. His determined and confident attitude earned the respect of his fellow slaves. His military experience meant that he often complained about the incompetence of other slaves and asserted himself in a commanding role during several raids. One day, Sharp Spear recognized his talents and promoted him to one of the commanding officers of the slave liberation army. This proved to be controversial, as many soldiers under his command complained of his harsh discipline and unyielding attitude."
 ABY_horse_general:0 "Fahd Al-Kasaar"
 ABY_horse_general_desc:0 "Born into slavery in Yemane, Fahd was always an obedient and hard worker. He received no education and spent much of his life carrying and hauling heavy objects. When his owner received a lucrative offer from an Abyssinian merchant, he was sold to an Abyssinian noble to work as her personal steed. That was when his obedient spirit started to crack, as the feline treated him more like an animal than a slave, feeding him nothing but oats and keeping him in a stable. Eventually he reached his limit and kicked his owner in the ribs, crushing her chest and galloping away to escape. His strong physique allowed him to survive in the wilderness for many weeks until he was finally found by a group of armed slaves led by a pony called Sharp Spear.\n\nSince then, Fahd has always been grateful to Sharp for saving him and even swore an oath to serve her. While she claimed all slaves were free to do as they wished, Fahd remained by her side and acted as her personal bodyguard. Over time, he earned Sharp's trust and was soon allowed to lead a raid on his own despite his lack of experience. Through his charisma and determination, the raid was a rousing success and Fahd was promoted to a high rank in the slave liberation army. While some question his intelligence and lack of education, soldiers under his command like him for his friendly and easy-going attitude, while Sharp likes him for his undying loyalty and unconditional obedience."

 ABY_wingbardian_concessions:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which, according to the Abyssinian version of the treaty, stipulated that Abyssinia "temporarily leased" the island of Purrsia in exchange for development aid and trade agreements. However, it was later discovered the Wingbardian version of the treaty claimed the island was permanently transferred to them, which soured relations. Things became even worse when the Storm King sacked and burned Abyssinia. Rather than being a potential ally on Zebrica, Abyssinia now appeared more like a weak and helpless country. Wingbardy took advantage of this, forcing King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the recent Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat. While the economy benefits from Wingbardian activity, most of the populace resents the treaty."
 ABY_angry_slaves:0 "Slave Unrest"
 ABY_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewodora II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races. Over the century, hundreds of thousands of slaves have been acquired from abroad, either through trade or force. These slaves are for the most part ponies, donkeys, zebras and horses. Following the Storm King's invasion, many of them rose up against their owners, starting a spiral of deadly violence that could escalate out of control."
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership:0 "Paralyzed Government"
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia has traditionally been an absolute monarchy ruled by decree. However, King Gomez's poor mental state has resulted in the government being left completely idle, unable to do anything without the King's approval or command. Normally this would be enough of a problem, but in times of crisis decisions are urgently needed, yet no one makes them. As a result, Abyssinia is becoming increasingly chaotic and the aristocats are beginning to question Gomez's ability to rule."
 ABY_risk_of_famine:0 "Risk Of Famine"
 ABY_risk_of_famine_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula is a dry region largely unsuited for agriculture, with many cats in the countryside still living as pastoralists. Worse still, arable land in the highlands is used for growing cash crops for export such as coffee. As cats are also obligate carnivores, the rest of arable land is used for cattle fodder. Before the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinia was perfectly capable of importing tonnes of meat from abroad, but with an empty, sacked treasury and ever increasing internal instability, these imports have almost completely ceased. Food stocks are slowly but surely becoming completely empty. If nothing is done, starvation will threaten almost the entire populace."
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_2:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_2_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia. This treaty was seen as fair. However, after the Storm King invaded and greatly weakened Abyssinia, Wingbardy forced King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat.\n\nThe Abyssinian government has taken action to mitigate the effects of the treaty at the expense of reduced cooperation with Wingbardy."

As such, they have an infrastructure in place to produce enough meat for export at a relatively low price."
 ABY_WNG_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Wingbardy"
 ABY_WNG_food_imports_desc:0 "The existing economic ties have made it easy for Abyssinian merchants to import food en masse from Wingbardy.

However, they are also trying to profit as much as possible while knowing Abyssinia's desperate need for food, so the prices aren't fair in the slightest."

 ABY_KLG_food_imports_desc:0 "Despite not recognizing Klugetown's sovereignty, Abyssinia has been forced to import food from it. How the Klugetowners are able to provide so much meat for export is a mystery, however, and it is hard to say what sort of creatures were butchered for their flesh."

 ABY_famine:0 "Famine"
 ABY_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen exponentially recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season.

When the Crown Guard attempted to catch her, she climbed atop a lamp pole with remarkable dexterity, resulting in a miniature siege. The [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_nocap] himself intervened, and, contrary to what anyone was expecting him to say, thanked her for hitting him. He then ordered the guard to stand down. The dark blue cat descended and apologized to the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_nocap], offering him a pretzel out of all things. Gomez had no idea where she had gotten Griffonian food from, especially as cats were carnivores and did not eat baked goods, but accepted the apology nonetheless. This was the start of a rather peculiar friendship."

 ABY_new_economic_plan_2_desc:0 "The newly created economic plan takes into account the current situation of Abyssinia. While at its core it remains the same as previous plans, it seeks to make the nation more self-reliant while also seeking more diverse cooperation with foreign countries. Mostly liberal economic policies combined with state intervention to stimulate growth and development remain in place."
 ABY_high_taxes:0 "High Taxes"
 ABY_high_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes are the primary source of income for any government. However, citizens tend to dislike having to contribute a portion of their hard-earned income for the greater good of the nation. Especially rich citizens, who usually worked the least to earn their wealth. "
 ABY_loan:0 "Foreign Loan"
 ABY_loan_desc:0 "Abyssinia has secured a loan with a reasonable interest rate from an overseas bank. Eventually, it will have to be paid back, but that's a concern for future generations. For now, it's sufficient to simply pay the interest."
 ABY_brrrrrrrr:0 "Inflation Surge"
 ABY_brrrrrrrr_desc:0 "The State Bank of Abyssinia controls the monetary supply of the realm. As such, nothing stops it from just making money, especially now that the gold standard has been abandoned. However, filling the treasury in such an artificial manner will result in a temporary increase of inflation."

 ABY_more_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewodora II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races. Over the century, hundreds of thousands of slaves have been acquired from abroad, either through trade or force. These slaves are for the most part ponies, donkeys, zebras and horses.

 ABY_state_bank_desc:0 "The Bank of Abyssinia was established by King Mawkonnen in 977 ALB and is the oldest bank in the nation. It is private, yet has a monopoly on banking activities in Abyssinia. It closely cooperated with Wingbardian banks ever since 985, issuing banknotes that were funded by Wingbardy.

 ABY_assess_situation_desc:0 "I'm glad you have finally decided to retake the reins of the realm. It is time we hold a long-delayed meeting regarding the current critical status of the realm. While your mental state seems to have somewhat stabilized, it remains to be seen if you are back to your former self."
 
 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia:0 "Replace The Bank Of Abyssinia"
 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia_desc:0 "During his reign, King Mawkonnen had founded the Bank of Abyssinia, a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank. With the recent economic instability, I advise that this near-bankrupt bank is liquidated and replaced with a fully state-owned bank that will give us greater control of the economy."
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard:0 "Abandon The Gold Standard"
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "For about a century now, the Abyssinian purr has been a gold standard currency, backed by the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] treasury of the monarchy. Unfortunately, the Storm King's recent unauthorized permanent loan has caused rapid deflation due to lack of gold. I've been saying this for a while now, but it is finally time to move away from the gold standard."
 ABY_seek_trade_partners:0 "Seek New Trade Partners"
 ABY_seek_trade_partners_desc:0 "Abyssinia has long been a trading nation, yet the Storm King's invasion and resulting regional instability have left many merchants idle. The Negadras, head of the merchants, has proposed we try to sign trade agreements with more countries to open up new markets for us. Exporting goods such as coffee will help us refill our treasury."
 ABY_refill_treasury:0 "Refill The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Treasury"
 ABY_refill_treasury_desc:0 "With foundations for economic recovery laid, we can now focus on our crippling lack of funds. There are several options to weigh against each other, each of them with positive and negative aspects. You will have to decide which method we shall use to restore some of your lost wealth."
 ABY_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 ABY_public_works_projects_desc:0 "Public spending is one way to recover from economic disasters. Until now, we've lacked the funds, but thanks to the recent endeavours we can finally launch infrastructure projects across the realm. This will provide jobs for thousands of cats. I also recommend we do not employ any slaves, as their salaries would likely be seized by their owners."
 ABY_royal_reconstruction_program:0 "[Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Reconstruction Program"
 ABY_royal_reconstruction_program_desc:0 "Everything is finally in place. Now it is time to launch a large-scale nationwide effort to fully recover from the Storm King's invasion. It will be expensive enough to almost empty our treasury again, but afterwards we will be able to refill it much more easily than before."
 
 ABY_expand_fishing_fleet:0 "Expand Fishing Fleet"
 ABY_expand_fishing_fleet_desc:0 "With how dry the Abyssinian peninsula is, many cats rely on fishing to feed themselves especially on the coast. To improve food security, I recommend we invest our recently expanded funds into our fisheries. They will be able to hire more fishercats expand their infrastructure to build more fishing vessels. Of course, this infrastructure could have other uses as well."
 ABY_import_food:0 "Import Food"
 ABY_import_food_desc:0 "Abyssinia hasn't been self-reliant on food for many decades now, after much of our limited farmlands were dedicated to growing cash crops like coffee. Now that we've attempted to establish new trade routes, our merchants have the capital they need to restart food imports. Unfortunately, most of our neighbours are herbivores and we need meat more urgently than cattle feed, so our options are limited."
 ABY_distribute_food:0 "Open Soup Kitchens"
 ABY_distribute_food_desc:0 "The main cause of hunger is not necessarily food production, but distribution. Due to feudal taxation, many peasants cannot afford to buy food when they are unable to produce enough themselves. To increase societal food security, [ROOT.ABY_queen_loc_cap] Morticia proposes that we should establish food distribution centers or "soup kitchens" to provide free meals for the hungry cats."
 ABY_repurpose_plantations:0 "Plantations Into Pastures"
 ABY_repurpose_plantations_desc:0 "Much of the arable land in Abyssinia is currently used for growing cash crops, especially coffee. While it brings great wealth to merchants and landowners, it means we do not produce enough food domestically. With various laws and economic incentives, we can push plantations to be slowly turned into pastures for cattle. Not everycat will be happy with this arrangement."
 
 ABY_pacify_slaves_focus:0 "Slave Pacification Operations"
 ABY_pacify_slaves_focus_desc:0 "The unfortunate truth is that we cannot allow the slaves to run rampant, even if their grievances are justified. The only method of quickly restoring law and order is by force, as any attempts to negotiate or promise reforms have failed. Nevertheless, we only do this because we must. After peace has returned, I strongly recommend we attempt to abolish slavery."
 ABY_ban_slave_bulli:0 "Outlaw Mistreatment Of Slaves"
 ABY_ban_slave_bulli_desc:0 "Abyssinian law is written with the assumption that slavery is outlawed entirely, even if it is only true for cats. As such, there are no clauses regarding the treatment of slaves. To quell dissatisfaction of enslaved persons, I recommend you to decree that their mistreatment becomes a punishable crime. Some nobles won't be happy, but the slaves will be."
 ABY_ban_slave_trade:0 "End The Slave Trade"
 ABY_ban_slave_trade_desc:0 "After feline slavery was brought to a sudden end, imports of slaves into Abyssinia increased drastically as trade of non-feline slaves had not been forbidden. Banning all trade of slaves would be a controversial move, as it would largely end the lucrative business (which would also no doubt continue illegally), but I still recommend we do it."
 ABY_ban_slave_baby:0 "Freedom Of Wombs"
 ABY_ban_slave_baby_desc:0 "So far, slave owners have assumed that any offspring of slaves inherit their status from their parents, similarly to how offspring of cattle instantly become property of the parents' owner. However, if we pass a law where all sapient creatures in the realm are born free, then the slave population will stop growing naturally."
 ABY_emancipation_act:0 "The Emancipation Act"
 ABY_emancipation_act_desc:0 "With the gradual erosion of the institution of slavery, we can finally deliver the final death blow to this ancient practice. The Emancipation Act will rewrite Queen Mewodora II's slavery act by clearly stating the following: "All persons held as slaves in the realm shall forever be free, and their freedom shall be guaranteed by the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap].""
 
 ABY_revised_plan:0 "Revised Modernization Plan"
 ABY_revised_plan_desc:0 "King Mawkonnen's economic development plan, which you continued to follow until the Storm King's forceful restructuring of our economy, relied heavily on cooperation with Wingbardy. Now that they have shown their true colors, we need to formulate a new plan for the modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_noble_council:0 "Cooperate With Aristocats"
 ABY_noble_council_desc:0 "Implemeting the modernization plan will require cooperation with local governors who manage economic affairs. While most nobles are content maintaining agrarianism focused on export of cash crops, some of them have more ambitious plans and would be more than willing to work together with us."
 ABY_protectionist_taxation:0 "Protectionist Taxation"
 ABY_protectionist_taxation_desc:0 "Your predecessors trusted the griffons, and in return they immediately sought to exploit our nation. So far, foreign companies have been given concessions to conduct business freely, but this gives them an unfair advantage. By introducing new taxes, we will force them out of Abyssinia and allow our domestic businesses to grow."
 ABY_merchant_council:0 "Summon The Negadras"
 ABY_merchant_council_desc:0 "Implemeting the modernization plan will require cooperation with local merchants who are most directly impacted by our policies. The Negadras, head of the merchants, is an influential figure largely responsible for running our economy. They are far more eager about the prospects of industrialisation and foreign trade than the conservative nobles are."
 ABY_centralized_development:0 "Invest In The Catital"
 ABY_centralized_development_desc:0 "The city of Panthera, along with its hinterland, is already the most developed region in the realm, only rivaled by Coltoba. As such, there is a solid foundation to build upon. With the provinces under the control of local nobles, putting funds into the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] capital is a guaranteed way to empower your central authority."
 ABY_catpany:0 "Sign Contract With CAT Incorporated"
 ABY_catpany_desc:0 "It is difficult to overstate how many construction projects are required to create a modern nation. All of them require immense resources which in turn need well-organized logistics. Working together with nascent construction equipment manufacturers is a vital step towards the full modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_decentralized_development:0 "Invest In The Provinces"
 ABY_decentralized_development_desc:0 "While Panthera can be called a somewhat modern city, the same cannot be said for the outlying provinces, many of which are ruled by nobles who either lack the will or the funds to develop their own lordships. For Abyssinia to truly modernize, we must distribute development more evenly across the realm."
 ABY_tigray_panthera_connection:0 "Improve The Tigray-Panthera Connection"
 ABY_tigray_panthera_connection_desc:0 "The port city of Tigray is Panthera's gate to the wider world. Existing transportation infrastructure is sufficient for our current needs, but if we want to further grow the capital then it is vital to expand it. The railway will be improved, the harbour shall be expanded and new paved roads will be built."
 ABY_invest_in_general_goods_company:0 "Invest In The General Goods Company"
 ABY_invest_in_general_goods_company_desc:0 "I have recently learned about a successful small business called the General Goods Company. Yes, the name doesn't have a cat pun. They manufacture a wide variety of goods that are purchased both by our civilians and the military. If we provided them with increased funds, they could greatly expand their production, benefitting the entire nation."
 ABY_connecting_the_provinces:0 "Connect The Provinces"
 ABY_connecting_the_provinces_desc:0 "A railway was built years ago to connect Tigray, Panthera and Aspurra. Though this has secured the logistics of the capital, the rest of our country has been neglected. Therefore I recommend we undertake a great project to expand the railway network across the entire realm, connecting all notable settlements."
 ABY_car_company:0 "Subsidize Hissan Motors"
 ABY_car_company_desc:0 "Hissan Motors is a fledgling and struggling car manufacturer that has difficulty competing with oversears imports of vehicles. If we provided them with subsidies, they would gain a competitive advantage that could help them gain a pawhold on the market."
 ABY_ship_company:0 "Establish A State-Owned Dockyard"
 ABY_ship_company_desc:0 "So far, the needs of the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Navy are fulfilled by various small shipping companies as well as foreign imports. If we used our funds to found a dockyard, personally owned by you, we could have a more reliable supplier for all naval needs."
 ABY_airplane_company:0 "Sign A Deal With Leopardo Holdings"
 ABY_airplane_company_desc:0 "Leopardo Holdings is a company owned by a noble who is fascinated with aircraft. Under her personal patronage, the company has been able to compete against imported planes. However, the noble does not have an infinite supply of money to sustain the company. We should approach her and sign a deal where Leopardo will get the exclusive right to make planes for us."
 ABY_panthera_dam:0 "Build The Grand Panthera Dam"
 ABY_panthera_dam_desc:0 "Modern industries and households consume immense amounts of energy. Energy that could be easily generated by damming the Panther river that flows next to the capital. Of course, it would reduce the amount of water flowing downstream and create a large reservoir, but a single dam would be enough to power the country for years to come."
 ABY_desert_irrigation:0 "Irrigating The Desert"
 ABY_desert_irrigation_desc:0 "While vast irrigation projects were conducted in the past century along the Panter river, the same cannot be said for the eastern Tiger river. It would only be fair to invest in the poorer eastern provinces as well. Irrigation would not only increase rural productivity, but provide local industries with more vital water."
 ABY_textile_factory:0 "Support The Yarn Industry"
 ABY_textile_factory_desc:0 "Yarn production is one of the mainstays of the Abyssinian economy. It is a sensible investment for us, and would help ensure all of our citizens and soldiers get any clothing they desire or need. This in turn would provide increased employment and boost the economy in general."
 ABY_salt_mine:0 "Open The Dollo Salt Mine"
 ABY_salt_mine_desc:0 "The dry endorheic basin of Dollo is one of the largest deposits of salt on Zebrica. Any rainwater that flows into it from the mountains ends up evaporating, which over the millennia has created a great source of salt. If we invested into opening a salt mine, we could provide plenty of this vital resource which can be used to conserve fish and other foods."
 ABY_steel_foundry:0 "Construct The Panthera Steel Foundry"
 ABY_steel_foundry_desc:0 "Modernization requires truly vast amounts of refined high-grade steel. This in turn needs a large-scale industrial operation that converts coal, flux stone and iron en masse into steel. Therefore I recommend we launch a construction project in Panthera with the intention to build one of the largest foundries on Zebrica."
 ABY_expand_mines:0 "Expand Mining Operations"
 ABY_expand_mines_desc:0 "There are many mines scattered across the ore-rich mountains of Abyssinia. Most of them are operated by private individuals such as nobles, and utilize manual labour to arduously extract minerals. The state clearly needs to intervene to expand and modernize these mines, and in exchange receive a share of the profits."
 ABY_modern_healthcare:0 "Provide Modern Healthcare"
 ABY_modern_healthcare_desc:0 "Industrial work is prone to accidents, and increased pollution causes many health issues. As such, workers are increasingly demanding better access to healthcare. There is no reason for us to not provide them with what they want. I suggest we begin establishing a state-owned healthcare system, staffed by skilled professionals."
 ABY_elektirsity:0 "Electrify The Nation"
 ABY_elektirsity_desc:0 "While cats don't need electric lamps to light up the streets, electricity can be used for countless different purposes. It can be said that electricity is the foundational pillar of truly modern societies. Not only will our industry utilize it, but the citizens as well, to power their household appliances. The military can get a use out of it, too."
 ABY_r_and_d_center:0 "Center Of Research and Technological Development"
 ABY_r_and_d_center_desc:0 "In cooperation with the leading companies of Abyssinia, we should establish a centralized facility for conducting scientific research. This would not only lead to new, innovative products, but give us a place among the advanced nations of the world."
 
 ABY_ban_child_labour:0 "Outlaw Kitten Labour"
 ABY_ban_child_labour_desc:0 "While the literacy program of King Mawkonnen, your father, has been very successful at rapidly increasing the literacy rate of adults, we can't forget about the kittens too. Many youth do not attend school as they work as employees instead. It is finally time we ban the use of underaged workers and make school attendance mandatory."
 ABY_support_royal_academy:0 "Found The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Academy"
 ABY_support_royal_academy_desc:0 "To cultivate intellectualism in Abyssinia, we should create a national academy under your patronage. It will promote enlightenment, preservation of traditional values and research to increase the prosperity and well-being of your subjects. Its duty will also be to ostracize intellecuals with excessively radical or dangerous ideologies."
 ABY_standardized_language:0 "Standardize The Abyssinian Language"
 ABY_standardized_language_desc:0 "The Abyssinian language and its script are both almost a thousand years old. However, especially in the provinces other dialects and even languages are spoken. Through education, we should ensure our tongue is used identically across Abyssinia to faciliate communication and enforce the unity of the realm."
 ABY_university_of_panthera:0 "Establish The Panthera University"
 ABY_university_of_panthera_desc:0 "Abyssinia has so far lacked a public institution of tertiary education. Now that we are civilized enough, it is time to create one. The new state university will be located in the capital, spread out across multiple campuses, and admit only those who pass the challenging entrance exams to prove their worth."
 
 ABY_assess_storm_king_invasion:0 "Analyze The Storm King's Invasion"
 ABY_assess_storm_king_invasion_desc:0 "While our defeat to the Storm King was a bitter drop to swallow, we must not get stuck in the past. Instead, we need to investigate what went wrong and draft plans for improving our armed forces, so we can repel any other invaders in the future. Failures are to be learned from, after all."
 ABY_modernizing_navy:0 "Modernize The [Root.ABY_royal_loc_cap] Navy"
 ABY_modernizing_navy_desc:0 "Modernizing our naval forces means not only refitting our ships, but also updating our combat stratagems. The long coast and many overseas trade routes of our country can only be secured by a navy that knows how to fight against advanced and well-organized opponents."
 ABY_professional_army:0 "Professionalize The Army"
 ABY_professional_army_desc:0 "Most of the Abyssinian army, besides the small contingent of Crown Guard, consists of feudal levies drafted from the provinces. Their lack of training meant that they melted away before a superior foe. Replacing them with proper full-time professional soldiers would not only reduce our reliance on nobles, but improve the quality of the army as well."
 ABY_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Catscription"
 ABY_mass_conscription_desc:0 "One explanation for our military weakness is our relatively small population, which results in a lack of catpower for the army. This issue can be addressed by expanding conscription and making it every subject's sworn duty to serve in the army if needed. Of course, conscription has traditionally been the duty of nobility, so we must be careful with them."
 ABY_hire_mercenaries:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
 ABY_hire_mercenaries_desc:0 "Instead of trying to fix our own army, we could simply hire experienced soldiers from abroad. There are plenty of options available on the mercenary market. Unfortunately, they are rather expensive and they are only loyal to money, not you. But they are well worth the price."
 ABY_establish_air_force:0 "Establish The Abyssinian Air Force"
 ABY_establish_air_force_desc:0 "One of the primary reasons for our defeat against the Storm King was the complete lack of an air force, meaning we had no counter to the yeti airships. Thankfully, the hippogriffs proved the world that modern air planes rule the sky. We must simply follow their example and lay the foundations of a proper air force."
 ABY_asymmetric_naval_warfare:0 "Asymmetric Naval Warfare"
 ABY_asymmetric_naval_warfare_desc:0 "If we ever have to face a larger enemy navy, let's say, one belonging to an expansionist overseas griffon kingdom, then we should not try to face them in a direct confrontation. Rather, we should follow the suggestion of one of our admirals and invest in affordable yet effective submarines that can utilize hit-and-run tactics."
 ABY_convert_convoys:0 "Convert Merchant Ships"
 ABY_convert_convoys_desc:0 "As a trading nation, our mercantile class owns a substantial number of cargo vessels. We could purchase some of them at a low price, then go through the effort of converting them into warships. This would be a far more economical way to expand our navy compared to building ships from scratch."
 ABY_meritocratic_offier_promotion:0 "Meritocratic Officer Corps"
 ABY_meritocratic_offier_promotion_desc:0 "While we don't lack capable leaders for our army, many officers are still aristocrats who gained their positions through inheritance. We should consider making our officer corps entirely meritocratic, meaning military positions have to be earned through exemplary service."
 ABY_reinforce_local_garrisons:0 "Reinforce Local Garrisons"
 ABY_reinforce_local_garrisons_desc:0 "Protection of provinces has traditionally been the duty of local nobles who maintain their own retinues. Relying on these private armies is unwise, as was proven by their ineffectiveness during the invasion of the Storm King. We should send soldiers from the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army to not only aid the nobles, but to better defend our country."
 ABY_purchase_hippogriff_planes:0 "Purchase Hippogriff Planes"
 ABY_purchase_hippogriff_planes_desc:0 "The hippogriffs did what we could not, defeating the Storm King's fearsome armada of airships with nimble fighters and other planes. We should acquire some of these technological marvels for our own use, so no one can ever threaten Abyssinia from the skies again."
 ABY_pilot_training:0 "Train Pilots"
 ABY_pilot_training_desc:0 "Without the industrial capacity to build a large air force, we must instead focus on improving the quality of the personnel. Rigorous training will ensure only the finest pilots will defend the skies of Abyssinia from the enemy. Hopefully, they will be able to face off against greater numbers and even seemingly impossible odds."
 ABY_cattier:0 "A Converted Cattier"
 ABY_cattier_desc:0 "During the reign of your father, construction began on a Mawkonnen-class dreadnought that was never finished and was left abandoned. It can be put to use again. However, modern naval warfare appears to rely heavily on air support, so it'd make more sense to make it into a carrier, I mean, cattier instead."
 ABY_steal_torpedo_designs:0 "Steal Wingbardian Torpedo Designs"
 ABY_steal_torpedo_designs_desc:0 "Our former friends in Wingbardy are known for their advanced torpedoes. Years of cooperation means our own ships make extensive use of the same weapon. I normally don't suggest questionable action such as this, but perhaps some industrial espionage would enable us to upgrade our torpedo designs, if you understand what I mean."
 ABY_establish_general_staff:0 "Establish General Staff"
 ABY_establish_general_staff_desc:0 "An army without proper leadership is like a headless chicken. While command of the army is centralized in you, the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap], you cannot be everywhere at once, and neither can the generals. They need organized staff groups to assist them in their role of command and control. With a meritocratic foundation hopefully in place, creating such staff should be easy."
 ABY_military_motorization:0 "Military Motorization"
 ABY_military_motorization_desc:0 "For almost a century now, the Abyssinian army has made extensive use of slaves for transportation and logistics. With slavery being phased out and domestic production of motor vehicles established, the army can now utilize trucks instead. While they do consume fuel and are prone to breaking down, they don't rebel against their owners."
 ABY_improved_occupation:0 "Counterinsurgency Experience"
 ABY_improved_occupation_desc:0 "Prolonged conflict with Manedalusian resistance has given our armed forces plenty of experience related to fighting against insurgents. This experience should be analyzed and combined with foreign military theory to greatly improve the effectiveness of our garrison units."
 ABY_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
 ABY_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Ships have traditionally ruled the waves, but it appears aircraft are attempting to dethrone them. A proper modern navy must combine both sea and air power to thrive against its enemies. As such, we need to invest time and resources into naval aircraft."
 ABY_anti_air_defence:0 "Anti-Aircraft Defences"
 ABY_anti_air_defence_desc:0 "With limited industrial production capacity, we cannot necessarily build a large enough air fleet to defend the skies of the realm. As such, we need to invest in ground-based defences to protect our cities and our troops from aerial attacks."
 ABY_special_forces_shit:0 "Formalize The Special Forces"
 ABY_special_forces_shit_desc:0 "Traditionally, experienced highlanders have acted as the "special forces" of the Abyssinian army, fighting in difficult terrain and conducting challenging operations. But if we want to further expand and develop our special forces, we need to properly organize them as a modern subsection of the larger military."
 ABY_tonk:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 ABY_tonk_desc:0 "The flat desert terrain that is common in Abyssinia is ideal for armoured warfare. These so-called "tanks" can quickly overrun unprepared enemy infantry with ease, able to withstand small-arms fire. While expensive, we should still consider utilizing them in the army."
 ABY_mag_weapons:0 "Magical Stun Weapons"
 ABY_mag_weapons_desc:0 "While cats are unable to utilize magic, unicorns often use stun spells to incapacitate opponents. New technology based on crystals allows spells to be cast by any creature. Our garrisons would greatly benefit from such magical weapons. Of course, that is true for the rest of the army as well, assuming we set up the required production lines."
 ABY_nuclear_deterrent:0 "The Ultimate Deterrent"
 ABY_nuclear_deterrent_desc:0 "It is entirely possible, even likely, that our sovereignty will be threatened again and again. To secure our independence against the great powers of the world, we need the most powerful weapon in existence. Thankfully, the theories of famed physicist Alpurrt Catstein have laid the groundwork for the development of such a weapon."
 
 ABY_convene_council:0 "Convene The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_convene_council_desc:0 "The council of nobility is an advisory body consisting of the most influential nobles of Abyssinia. Its meetings have in recent years been organized by the aristocats themselves, but you, as the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap], also have the right to do so. I think it's time to summon them to the catital and remind them who is truly in charge of the country."
 ABY_assert_authority:0 "Assert Absolute Authority"
 ABY_assert_authority_desc:0 "In Abyssinia, there are traditionally no limits on the monarch's power. As much as the nobles tried to subvert this fact during the reign of the Catwe dynasty, it remains true to this day. So remember, you are not just above the law; you ARE the law."
 ABY_power_to_people:0 "Power To The People"
 ABY_power_to_people_desc:0 "You and the commoners have a common enemy: the scheming nobility. So why not forge an alliance with them? Delegate some of your [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] authority to competent commonfolk like me. After all, I have proven that we "mudblooded" cats can be relied upon, as we earn our wealth and power through hard work rather than just inheriting them from our parents."
 ABY_expand_crown_guard:0 "Expand The Crown Guard"
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_desc:0 "While regional levies often have secondary loyalties to their feudal liege lords, the Crown Guard is a dedicated professional force loyal to you alone. To further strengthen [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] authority over the nation, you should consider recruiting more members to your personal armed retinue."
 ABY_land_reform:0 "Implement Land Reform"
 ABY_land_reform_desc:0 "Almost all arable land in Abyssinia is owned by a small number of magnates, most of whom are part of the Mesafint. As such, most tenants pay high rents and can barely afford any taxes. Of course, ultimately all land in Abyssinia belongs to the crown. As such, you have extensive authority to redistribute land as much as necessary."
 ABY_estates_assembly:0 "Establish The Assembly Of Estates"
 ABY_estates_assembly_desc:0 "As a legislative body to counterbalance the council of nobility, we shall organize the Assembly of Estates, consisting of deputies elected from all social classes. For now, their power remains limited. But if you so desire, they can be gradually given the ability to propose and pass legislation even without your approval."
 ABY_blessed_of_baast:0 "The [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap] Who Turns The Wheel Of Virtue"
 ABY_blessed_of_baast_desc:0 "While the priesthood care little about politics, preferring the seclusion of their temples, great legitimacy and influence can be gained by earning their blessing. Thanks to your previous interactions with the late Abuna of Felibela, you could relatively easily proclaim yourself a divine monarch who follows the path to enlightenment."
 ABY_outlaw_private_armies:0 "Outlaw Private Armies"
 ABY_outlaw_private_armies_desc:0 "Traditionally, the Mesafint have had the privilege of raising personal retinues to guard their estates. These small private armies give the aristocats military power that can be used against the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] government. As such, I highly recommend we disband these forces and integrate them into the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army."
 ABY_empower_mekwanint:0 "Empower The Mekwanint"
 ABY_empower_mekwanint_desc:0 "The Abyssinian upper class has traditionally been divided into two categories: the Mesafint, hereditary elites, and the Mekwanint, the appointed officials who are often commoners. I, of course, belong to the latter group, so I may be biased. Nevertheless, I still strongly believe that we should take over some of the responsibilities of the fickle nobles."
 ABY_progressive_taxation:0 "Introduce Progressive Taxation"
 ABY_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "It is common sense that those with more wealth can afford to give a larger share of it away. However, nobles aren't known for their appreciation of common sense. Nonetheless, taxing the wealthier more and the poorer less would be a controversial reform, yet would greatly affect wealth inequality in favour of the masses."
 ABY_advisory_council:0 "Abolish The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_advisory_council_desc:0 "The council of nobility was originally supposed to have a purely advisory role, providing counsel to the ruling monarch. Since the reign of the Catwe dynasty however, they've had the privilege of being able to elect a new monarch at will. This dangerous political body can now finally be disbanded with a new decree. All you have to do is sign it."
 
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty:0 "Unilaterally Repeal The Treaty Of Katren"
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_desc:0 "The Katren concession is a dagger pointed at the heart of Abyssinia. However, it is protected by the Treaty of Katren, which you were pressured to sign under duress. As its legality itself is questionable, you have the right to repeal it, but know that Wingbardy might response with military force. We must be ready to fight if necessary."
 ABY_try_to_negotiate:0 "Attempt To Negotiate With Wingbardy"
 ABY_try_to_negotiate_desc:0 "You once said that "The only thing we have in common with griffons are feline rears". While that may be true, we should still seek to avoid triggering a risky armed confrontation that could end in our defeat. Diplomacy is thankfully an option, as Wingbardians haven't yet become completely unreasonable."
 ABY_liberate_katren:0 "Liberate Katren"
 ABY_liberate_katren_desc:0 "The time has come for us to reassert our sovereignty and reclaim Katren for ourselves. Of course, as the occupiers see the town as rightfully theirs, they will likely put up a fight. But chances are we can negotiate a peace treaty with them if we manage to firmly expel them from the Abyssinian mainland."
 ABY_negotiate_for_katren:0 "Request The Return Of Katren"
 ABY_negotiate_for_katren_desc:0 "The current occupiers of Katren seem to be open for negotiations. Perhaps we can convince them to vacate our territory peacefully. If not, we will still have to reclaim Katren by force, but hopefully they will listen to reason and understand that the town was seized illegally."
 ABY_contact_ras_of_purrsia:0 "Contact The Ras of Purrsia"
 ABY_contact_ras_of_purrsia_desc:0 "According to the deal made with Wingbardy, the Rasdom of Purrsia is temporarily under protectorate status. Of course, the Wingbardian version of the treaty claimed this status is permanent, but they also agreed to respect our territorial sovereignty. Seeing how they violated this treaty, it's clear we can violate it as well."
 ABY_purchase_purrsia:0 "Purchase Purrsia"
 ABY_purchase_purrsia_desc:0 "While the Rasdom of Purrsia was legally ceded to Wingbardy, there's no reason why we couldn't legally buy it back. I'm sure that if we offer enough currency, the owners of the island would gladly sell it to us. However, the sum might end up being rather large, so we must prepare our treasury for that."
 ABY_anti_wingbardianism:0 "An Enemy Of My Enemy..."
 ABY_anti_wingbardianism_desc:0 "Wingbardy showed us how they cannot be trusted. While we have managed to expel the perfidious griffons from Abyssinia, they remain a threat to many other nations. Rather than doing nothing, we should actively support Wingbardy's enemies and oppose their expansionism. A weaker Wingbardy results in a safer Abyssinia."
 ABY_make_amends_with_wingbardy:0 "Normalize Relations With Wingbardy"
 ABY_make_amends_with_wingbardy_desc:0 "Now that territorial disputes between our two countries have been solved, there's no reason to not return to our past productive relationship with Wingbardy. After all, they greatly helped us with modernization during the past century. Forgive and forget, as they say."
 ABY_liberate_les_meridiennes:0 "Liberate Les Meridiennes"
 ABY_liberate_les_meridiennes_desc:0 "Our anti-colonial efforts have been successful. Why not continue them? Not far to the northwest, the island chain of Les Meridiennes was an Aquileian colony for well over a century. By liberating them from griffon minority rule, we not only improve our reputation, but gain strategically valuable islands."
 ABY_liberate_trots_and_canters:0 "Liberate Trots And Canters"
 ABY_liberate_trots_and_canters_desc:0 "The Trots and Canters islands were colonized by Hippogriffia some centuries ago. It has a small indigenous pony population, which is enough of a justification to militarily occupy, or "liberate", the island chain. All we need is a window of opportunity for a swift and secretive overseas operation. Perhaps when the owners of the islands are busy with conflict?"
 ABY_approach_hippogriffs:0 "Military Cooperation With Mount Aris"
 ABY_approach_hippogriffs_desc:0 "In recent years, Wingbardy displayed some degree of hostility towards [HIP.GetNameDef]. As such, it is in the strategic interest of both of our nations to support each other militarily, to improve security in northern Zebrica. I'm sure both of us have much to learn from each other."
 ABY_liberate_puerto_caballo:0 "Liberate Puerto Caballo"
 ABY_liberate_puerto_caballo_desc:0 "The island of Puerto Caballo was under Equestrian dominion for a long time, but the island can hardly be called Equestrian. Yet remnants of foreign minority rule persist, despite the island nation regaining its lost freedom. It is clear they need a gracious country like Abyssinia to provide them with much-needed liberty."
 ABY_approach_equestria:0 "An Alliance With Equestria"
 ABY_approach_equestria_desc:0 "Equestria remains the undisputed superpower, despite not exerting its influence too much abroad. Yet judging by events in Hippogriffia, Kiria and Griffonstone, this is changing. If we managed to secure an alliance with this massive nation, our own security would be guaranteed for many years to come."
 
 ABY_manedalusia_is_abyssinia:0 "Manedalusia Is Abyssinia"
 ABY_manedalusia_is_abyssinia_desc:0 "Manedalusia was part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia from 12 ALB to 672 ALB. Based on historical records, Abyssinia controlled it longer than any other country. Thus, our claim to the region is the strongest one. Of course, the previous war over the region ended in a bloody stalemate, so trying again might be risky."
 ABY_cede_manedalusia:0 "Cede Manedalusia"
 ABY_cede_manedalusia_desc:0 "With Manedalusia, we might be suffering from sunk cost fallacy. The brutal war of 988 with Maregypt and two decades of expensive occupation have been a great drain on our resources. Not only that, but our relations with the current occupiers of Manedalusia have been ruined. While controversial, abandoning Manedalusia would be a quick way to cut our losses."
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt:0 "Negotiate About The Status Of Manedalusia"
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_desc:0 "Tensions with Maregypt over Manedalusia have lasted for two decades. Rather than continuing to fight over the region, we could turn Manedalusia into a buffer state, similar to Klugetown's de facto status. It would mean both sides giving up their claims on the region in the name of mutual peace and coexistence."
 ABY_integrate_manedalusia:0 "The Province Of Manedalusia"
 ABY_integrate_manedalusia_desc:0 "In the past, Manedalusia was governed as an integral part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia, despite lacking a feline majority population. This meant the region was treated same as any other province, with local governance being the responsibilty of a noble, the Basha. Integrating the region will require some degree of cooperation from the locals, however."
 ABY_federation_with_manedalusia:0 "The Federal Act"
 ABY_federation_with_manedalusia_desc:0 "The Manedalusians have shown that they will not easily accept a return to the previous status quo. Much has changed in the 300 or so years since we lost Manedalusia. Pro-Abyssinian ponies have proposed the formation of a federation, with Manedalusia having both extensive self-rule and some power in the central government."
 ABY_manedalusian_auxiliaries:0 "Manedalusian Auxiliaries"
 ABY_manedalusian_auxiliaries_desc:0 "After regaining Coltoba in 988, some recruitment among the local ponies was started to make use of their unique abilities such as flight and use of magic. While seen as more unreliable, ponies can nonetheless be a very effective supplement for the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army. As such, we should consider greatly expanding their recruitment."
 ABY_alliance_with_MGY:0 "Form An Alliance With Maregypt"
 ABY_alliance_with_MGY_desc:0 "With our disputes with Maregypt resolved and the relations between our two nations greatly improved, we should consider further deepening our ties to the eastern ponies. They would make for a powerful ally, and could help us avoid repeating the past, when both Kingdoms were separately subjugated by Saddle Arabia."
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_2:0 "Negotiate About The Status Of Klugetown"
 ABY_negotiate_with_maregypt_2_desc:0 "Klugetown was founded as a trade outpost on an oasis in Abyssinian territory in 467 ALB. Ever since, they have done their best to act independent from us, which culminated in 947 when any Abyssinian officials were expelled and they stopped obeying our laws. After the 988 conflict, Maregypt has supported them. We should negotiate with them to have any chance in reclaiming Klugetown."
 ABY_support_ovingoland:0 "Support The Ovingoland Movement"
 ABY_support_ovingoland_desc:0 "After the Storm King's rampage, southern Maregypt was filled to the brim with zebra refugees. With Maregypt itself suffering from internal instability, these zebras have been neglected and demand better treatment. We could use these tensions to our advantage by supporting the creation of an independent zebra state which would be reliant on our aid."
 ABY_ultimatum_to_klugetown:0 "Reassert Sovereignty Over Klugetown"
 ABY_ultimatum_to_klugetown_desc:0 "De jure, Klugetown has been part of [ABY.GetNameDef] for centuries. De facto, it has acted like a rogue city-state ever since Saddle Arabia turned us into a tributary. It is time law and order is restored in this crime-infested oasis city. Ideally, [KLG.GetLeader] will be willing to negotiate, but if not, we must be ready to use force."
 ABY_trade_with_alliance:0 "Trade With Allies"
 ABY_trade_with_alliance_desc:0 "Our new alliance enables us to establish new commercial ties with other countries. These ties would not only provide our merchants with additional profits, and thus the treasury with additional taxes, but also strengthen our bond with our new allies, thus guaranteeing peace between us."
 ABY_research_with_alliance:0 "Scientific Cooperation With Allies"
 ABY_research_with_alliance_desc:0 "Scientific advancement often requires the sharing and exchange of knowledge, as well as cooperation between researchers. Abyssinian intellectuals have proposed that we create the administrative, legal and logistical groundwork necessary for international scientific cooperation with our new allied states."
 ABY_topple_mgy_government:0 "Topple Unfriendly Maregyptian Government"
 ABY_topple_mgy_government_desc:0 "The illegitimate [MGY.Capital.GetName] regime clearly has no interest in having a peaceful and friendly relationship with us. As such, to secure our eastern border, we have no choice but to use military force to reorganize Maregyptian politics and replace [MGY.GetLeader]'s government with a more cooperative one."
 ABY_restore_law_and_order_in_KLG:0 "Restore Law And Order In Klugetown"
 ABY_restore_law_and_order_in_KLG_desc:0 "As an independent city-state, Klugetown was ruled by the ruthless mafia boss Verko and was a hotspot for all kinds of crimes. Now that we've regained control of the wayward city, I highly recommend we send in all law enforcement officials available to clean up the mess. Then, we will hold elections for a new Kantiba, lord mayor."
 ABY_the_kloog_connection:0 "The Klugetown Connection"
 ABY_the_kloog_connection_desc:0 "Klugetown grew as a city thanks to its central location and became a nexus for desert trade routes, like the ones between Abyssinia and Maregypt or the one crossing from Coltoba to Farasrah, connecting the Manedalusian Bay to the Arabian Sea. These traditional caravans can now be replaced with modern railways and trains."
 ABY_ally_donkeys:0 "Seek An Alliance With The Donkeys"
 ABY_ally_donkeys_desc:0 "The donkey states that exist downstream on the Tiger and Panther rivers were once subjects of Abyssinia, but in these modern times we can develop a more equal and amicable relationship. We should invite them to our newly formed alliance, for together we will be stronger, perhaps strong enough to resist superpowers like Saddle Arabia."
 ABY_dominate_donkeys:0 "Dominate The Donkeys"
 ABY_dominate_donkeys_desc:0 "In 150 ALB, Abyssinia subjugated the donkeys of the south under its rule. This lasted until the 5th century when Saddle Arabia seized the lands from us, but during that time the vassal states prospered. The donkeys have been independent since 989, but history tells us that they are unable to rule themselves. Most importantly, we can secure our wide and defenceless southern border."
 ABY_liberate_farasrah:0 "Liberate Farasrah"
 ABY_liberate_farasrah_desc:0 "The port-city of Farasrah is disputed between the donkeys and the state of Yemane. While having a mixed population of horses and donkeys, it was historically part of Anseruk before Yemane seized it with military force in the aftermath of Saddle Arabia's withdrawal from the region in 989. This gives us the casus belli we need to secure our connection to the Arabian Sea."

 ABY_just_as_according_to_keikaku_desc:0 "Historians will call it the Catwe Restoration, but for me it was just one step in my plan. There is still much work to be done, as I must first secure my rule. The nobles think I will be their puppet, so they will try to discard me if I ever even raise a claw against them. Thankfully, the nobles are also arrogant idiots. They won't realize what I'm doing until it's too late."
 ABY_hidden_wealth:0 "Hidden Wealth"
 ABY_hidden_wealth_desc:0 "My family managed to hide away plenty of treasure from the vengeful Clawomons. Some in secret vaults, some on offshore bank accounts, some guarded by loyalist nobles. Now that the royal treasury is ours, we can fill it with all our concealed assets. I will keep it all safe, unlike the foolish Clawomons who lost everything."
 ABY_reduce_slave_rations:0 "Reduce Slave Rations"
 ABY_reduce_slave_rations_desc:0 "With a looming famine, I'm afraid we can no longer afford to fully feed all our precious slaves. Cats take priority. I will meet with the nobles who own the most slaves and convince them to provide less sustenance for their property as well. This should result in lowered food demand and lower prices. The slaves won't like it, but that's part of the plan."
 ABY_turn_a_blind_eye:0 "Turn A Blind Eye"
 ABY_turn_a_blind_eye_desc:0 "Slaves are property and often end up being treated as such. Slave unrest is often fueled by mistreatment and abuse, all of which is technically not against the law. The Clawomons were displeased by this and used indirect means to punish or warn nobles for such behaviour, but I will promise to do no such thing. This should please the nobles and anger the slaves."
 ABY_cash_crop_tax:0 "Introduce Taxes On Cash Crops"
 ABY_cash_crop_tax_desc:0 "At this stage I should avoid unpopular policies, but it is impossible. The Clawomons left a potential famine for me to prevent, so I have no choice but to fix the situation by any means available. I will have to introduce hefty taxes on production and sale of cash crops, to encourage nobles and peasants to herd cattle instead."
 ABY_import_food_2:0 "Purchase Food From Abroad"
 ABY_import_food_2_desc:0 "With a refilled treasury, my royal government will be able to import meat from relatively few markets available, considering most neighbouring nations are full of herbivores. It won't be cheap, but I'll be able to resell this food to the populace for a low price, which should help stave off any starvation."
 ABY_bank_takeover:0 "Bail Out The Bank Of Abyssinia"
 ABY_bank_takeover_desc:0 "The Bank of Abyssinia, founded by the Clawomons, is a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank. The recent economic downturn has driven it to near bankruptcy. Desperation gives me an advantage. I will offer government loans and capital to the bank on the condition that the bank severs its ties to Wingbardy."

 ABY_legalize_slavery:0 "Legalize Non-Feline Slavery"
 ABY_legalize_slavery_desc:0 "The Clawomons outlawed feline slavery many decades ago, but were either too foolish or too cowardly to explicitly forbid the enslavement of other races. Until now, this has existed as a legal loophole exploited by the nobles, making it a grey area out of the reach of the government. By rewriting the law to clearly allow limited slavery, I can gain full control."
 ABY_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
 ABY_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "Abyssinia's weakness was proved when the Clawomons failed to defend the country from the invasion of the Storm King.

 ABY_eyes_of_the_tiger:0 "Eyes of the Tiger"
 ABY_eyes_of_the_tiger_desc:0 "My rule is anything but secure. Not only do the nobles seek to exploit me, but many cats remain loyal to the deposed Clawomons. While the Crown Guard function as my hammer with which I can crush my enemies, I need a finer tool to counter foes in a more delicate and concealed manner. A new organization of secret police shall be my dagger in the dark."
 ABY_next_step_of_plan:0 "The Next Step of the Plan"
 ABY_next_step_of_plan_desc:0 "With the slaves sufficiently riled up, they are preparing for a large-scale revolt against their masters.

They must know that I am the only one who can save our nation from certain doom."
 ABY_strengthen_garrisons:0 "Strengthen Local Garrisons"
 ABY_strengthen_garrisons_desc:0 "With the uppity slaves dealt with, I can now use the former militias of the nobles to reinforce law enforcement in the provinces.

 ABY_repurpose_slaves:0 "Repurpose the Slaves"
 ABY_repurpose_slaves_desc:0 "Working conditions on the vast plantations of the nobles were difficult, which contributed to dissatisfaction among slaves and eventually caused the revolts. With slaves now belonging to the state, I can put them to a more productive use. Factory labour may not be as profitable as growing cash crops, but it will strengthen our economy."
 ABY_distributed_arsenals:0 "Provincial Arsenals"
 ABY_distributed_arsenals_desc:0 "To prevent further slave revolts, arsenals will be distributed across the nation to provide the local garrisons with plentiful supplies of weapons they can use in emergencies.

 ABY_seize_mines_desc:0 "The mountains of Abyssinia are rich in valuable minerals, yet the mines that excavate them are owned by private individuals, mostly nobles. Strategically vital resources must be in the possession of the state. As such, I will sign a decree to expropriate all mines in Abyssinia. Afterwards state-owned slaves can be put to work in them."
 ABY_fortification_brigades:0 "Fortification Brigades"
 ABY_fortification_brigades_desc:0 "While Abyssinia has always benefitted from its defensive terrain, it is not enough in this age of machines. Proper and modern defences need to be built to fend off any potential invaders of our nation, and I can put the state-owned slaves to work constructing them. They'll be happy to do something more useful than harvesting coffee beans."
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_2:0 "Expand the Crown Guard"
 ABY_expand_crown_guard_2_desc:0 "The Clawomons created the Crown Guard and as such many of their veterans remain loyal to the pretender dynasty. Nevertheless, it is important for me to have an elite force under my direct control. I will promote promising and loyal soldiers from the ranks of the feudal levies and the garrisons to the Crown Guard. They can be trusted, as they'll owe me a debt of gratitude."
 ABY_bureaucratize_nobles:0 "Appoint Provincial Governors"
 ABY_bureaucratize_nobles_desc:0 "The provinces of Abyssinia have traditionally been ruled by their regional nobles who inherited their titles. This outdated and unreliable practice ends now. I shall grant the titles of provincial governors to Mekwanint who can be trusted. As their income will depend on their government salary, they will be far more loyal to me than the nobles are."
 ABY_nationalize_foreign_assets:0 "Nationalize Foreign Assets"
 ABY_nationalize_foreign_assets_desc:0 "The ceaseless plunder of Abyssinia done by foreigners will end now. Any property owned by those without Abyssinian nationality shall become state property without compensation to previous owners. They must be reminded that Abyssinia and all its wealth belong to the Abyssinians, and no one else."
 ABY_introduce_catscription:0 "Expand Catscription"
 ABY_introduce_catscription_desc:0 "Feudal levies scattered before the storm. If Abyssinia is to keep its independence, it will need a proper army that is built on a modern system of catscription. Every able-bodied adult citizen will have to go through a period of military service. Defence of the homeland should become every cat's patriotic duty, instead of being the task of selfish nobles."
 ABY_enlighten_populace:0 "Enlighten The Populace"
 ABY_enlighten_populace_desc:0 "The Clawomons started the effort to increase literacy rate in our nation, but I don't think they went far enough. They failed to abolish kitten labour and build enough schools in the countryside. I will succeed where they failed. If nothing else, my reign will be known for ending illiteracy in Abyssinia!"
 ABY_state_companies:0 "Establish State-Owned Enterprises"
 ABY_state_companies_desc:0 "Without firm guidance from the state, it would take many years for Abyssinia to properly industrialize. As such, I will create several government entities dedicated to production of industrial products. Many of which, purely coincidentally, can be used to equip modern armies. My long-term goal is to secure domestic production of critical goods."
 ABY_defend_coast:0 "Defend The Coasts"
 ABY_defend_coast_desc:0 "Due to its shape, the Abyssinian peninsula has a long coastline. Some might say it is impossible to defend all of it, but by Baast, I will try. The decrepit Abyssinian navy needs to be modernized, our ports need to be fortified, and our naval officers need to be retrained. Even then, it is not enough, but these changes are a good start."
 ABY_learn_to_fly:0 "Learn To Fly"
 ABY_learn_to_fly_desc:0 "Those feathered lions developed machines capable of flight, despite already being able to fly... at least they haven't been able to hoard their miracle invensions for themselves. Soon cats, too, will be able to soar in the skies. I will decree the establishment of the Abyssinian Air Force. That should even the odds somewhat, I hope."
 ABY_catrinas_school:0 "Catrina's School For Gifted Cats"
 ABY_catrinas_school_desc:0 "Too many exceptional cats are left with no choice but to live and work on their peasant farms. Such cats should be given a chance to accomplish greater things in life. Following Equestria's highly successful model, I will create an educational facility for those felines who can demonstrate their extraordinary talent."
 ABY_dam_the_rivers:0 "Dam The Rivers"
 ABY_dam_the_rivers_desc:0 "A truly modern country needs vast amounts of electricity to power countless machines and electronic devices. One of the best ways to produce energy is through hydropower, so I will order the construction of great dams on both Panther and Tiger rivers. Because of the resulting reservoirs, tens of thousands of cats will have to be relocated, but it is worth it."
 ABY_manedalusia_slave_state:0 "The Manedalusian Slave State"
 ABY_manedalusia_slave_state_desc:0 "Many cats, especially nobles, love claiming that Manedalusia is an integral part of Abyssinia... this is nonsense, feline population is a small minority there. No, Manedalusia will be the first of many slave states which have to provide the government with tribute of slaves every passing moon."
 ABY_foundations_of_welfare_state:0 "Foundations Of A Welfare State"
 ABY_foundations_of_welfare_state_desc:0 "A state's foremost duty is to defend its subjects. Traditionally this means defend from invaders and criminals, but why not expand this definition? All cats need to also be defended from disease, poverty and malnutrition. Other modern states, like Equestria, have already done this, so I say we just follow their example."
 ABY_research_institute:0 "Found The Feline Research Institute"
 ABY_research_institute_desc:0 "Feline minds are no less capable than those of other races, I am living proof of that. With the minds of many promising young cats being cultivated, I think it's time we put them to good use. A state-funded institute dedicated to innovative research programs shall be created under my most generous patronage."
 ABY_best_of_best:0 "The Best Of The Best"
 ABY_best_of_best_desc:0 "My army should be led by competent commanders, not by a bunch of corrupt sycophants and traditionalists stuck in the past.

 ABY_choo_choo_bitches:0 "Arteries Of Steel And Concrete"
 ABY_choo_choo_bitches_desc:0 "Turning Abyssinia into a unified and centralized nation-state has been quite the pain in the tail. Yet my work is almost done. I simply need to decree the construction of railways and roads to connect every remote corner of the Kingdom, which will not only allow rapid transport of goods and cats, but also help supply the military."
 ABY_reveal_plan:0 "Reveal My Plan To The Masses"
 ABY_reveal_plan_desc:0 "Another stage of my plan is nearing completion. The time for secrecy is about to end as well. Everything should soon be ready for the ultimate salvation of felinekind from oblivion. When I show them all what I have planned, some may protest or complain. But their mewling will be drowned out by the racuous exclamations of support and approval."

 ABY_ill_come_up_with_a_name_for_this_later_2_electric_boogaloo_desc:0 "The time for great battles is finally at paw. Abyssinia must expand its dominion and secure its borders, strenghtening itself through the right of conquest. It is the only way to turn the tide of history. It is our only chance at long-term survival. There is no other option. We shall do what we must."
 ABY_organize_the_supreme_command:0 "Organize The Supreme Military Command"
 ABY_organize_the_supreme_command_desc:0 "Leadership of the armed forces must be fully centralized under my authority. I will create the Supreme Military Command and appoint cats who have proven themselves capable and unquestionably loyal as its members. They will be responsible for executing my orders in practice and ensuring the military runs like a well-oiled machine."
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_2:0 "Unilaterally Repeal The Treaty Of Katren"
 ABY_unilaterally_revoke_treaty_2_desc:0 "The fact that the Clawomons signed the Treaty of Katren is a mark of shame for the entire nation and a stain upon our proud history.

 ABY_secrets_of_the_machine_desc:0 "Now that I have nothing to hide, I can reveal everything known about the Machine hidden beneath my family manor. While its origins are unknown, my studies and knowledge were instrumental in getting it to function again. Years of experience from producing Witchweed potion have also given me plenty of things to share with others."
 ABY_cavalry_finally_added_in_eaw:0 "Slave Cavalry"
 ABY_cavalry_finally_added_in_eaw_desc:0 "While slaves are a great source of cheap labour, they could be utilized by our military as well. Nobles already use slaves as steeds for travel, so why couldn't the soldiers do so as well? These "mounted" units would be able to traverse much faster than infantry, and the enslaved equines they ride can also function as meat shields."
 ABY_liberate_purrsia:0 "Operation: CAT ISLAND"
 ABY_liberate_purrsia_desc:0 "The despicable Clawomons sold out our lands to the griffons many years ago. Ever since, Purrsia has been under foreign occupation, with the local Ras being little more than a powerless figurehead. It is time to contact the Ras and reclaim what is rightfully ours."
 ABY_cut_off_klugetown:0 "Operation: CUTOFF"
 ABY_cut_off_klugetown_desc:0 "The Abyssinian city of Klugetown has been taken over by local criminal gangs who have managed to get Maregypt to secure their "independence". This is just another example of the weakness of the Clawomonic regime. However, I have a plan: incite an insurrection in Ovingoland to isolate Klugetown from their allies, then strike at them with full force."
 ABY_universal_healthcare:0 "Universal Feline Healthcare"
 ABY_universal_healthcare_desc:0 "Every cat in Abyssinia has the right to quick and proper healthcare provided by trained professionals. Thanks to my recent education programs, there are enough qualified cats to provide modern and effective treatment. Now the medical facilities just need sufficient funding to run properly. This I shall provide."
 ABY_anti_air_defence_2:0 "Shield The Skies"
 ABY_anti_air_defence_2_desc:0 "While Abyssinia may indeed lack a proper industrial capacity to build an expansive air force, I think we can invest in improved air-defence capabilities to lessen the negative impacts of potential enemy air superiority. Besides, I've heard anti-air cannons are quite good against ground targets as well..."
 ABY_mag_weapons_2:0 "Fusion Of Magic And Machines"
 ABY_mag_weapons_2_desc:0 "Abyssinia will be a shining example of the new age, where magic and technology have been perfectly merged. This union will enable our species to reach the same heights as those with innate magical abilities, ending millenia of inferiority for all catkind. I am the great prophet of this new golden age."
 ABY_rebuild_felibela:0 "Restore The Glory Of Felibela"
 ABY_rebuild_felibela_desc:0 "Felibela was built by one of my most esteemed ancestors many centuries ago as a holy city dedicated to the glory of Baast. However, nowadays it is little more than a village and a site of pilgrimage. I shall honour King Felibela by using royal funds to rebuild his eponymous city and put it back on the map."
 ABY_slave_literacy:0 "Educate The Slaves"
 ABY_slave_literacy_desc:0 "Now that slaves are no longer wasting their lives on plantation work, they need to be capable of doing more complex industrial tasks that often involve reading manuals and instructions. For this, they need to be literate. While there are some risks involved, it is absolutely necessary to provide basic education even to the slaves."
 ABY_yet_another_research_slot_focus:0 "Ascension Of The Feline Mind"
 ABY_yet_another_research_slot_focus_desc:0 "It is the might of science that has elevated catkind from its inherent weakness. The light of reason will expel the darkness of ignorance, and illuminate the path towards immortal greatness. Abyssinian minds need to be carefully cultivated, skill and intelligence rewarded, intellectualism encouraged. Only then can we achieve true enlightenment."
 ABY_convert_convoys_2:0 "Put Merchant Ships Into Better Use"
 ABY_convert_convoys_2_desc:0 "To compensate for our lack of industrial capability, we can quickly expand our navy by seizing merchant vessels and converting them into warships. I'm sure the merchants will be upset, but I'll make sure they'll be powerless to do anything about it. Our security is more important than the profit margins of the rich."
 ABY_invade_maregypt:0 "Liberate The Manedalusian Slave State"
 ABY_invade_maregypt_desc:0 "Continued foreign occupation of Manedalusia has been a thorn on our side ever since the Clawomons failed to maintain control of it. However, it does provide an excellent justification to destroy our eastern rivals completely. The Catwe dynasty shall succeed where our predecessors failed!"
 #Most of the Manedalusian slave state remains under foreign tyranny. Manedalusia has been Abyssinian land for centuries, even before the Catwe dynasty first became rulers. Whatever justifications are made for occupation or even Manedalusian independence are nonsense. I won't listen to it. Instead, I will take back what is rightfully ours."
 #Maregypt has had an antagonistic relationship with us ever since independence from the vile state of Saddle Arabia. I've seen no reasont to amend this foreign policy plunder of the Clawomons as it is quite advantageous for me. I always have a need for more equine slaves, and Maregypt has more than enough to offer.
 ABY_motorization:0 "Cats & Cars"
 ABY_motorization_desc:0 "Cats have always had a great disadvantage compared to most races: we are unable to carry heavy loads or pull large wagons like the four-legged races can. This has always made logistics and travel difficult without the use of pack animals or slaves. But with the introduction of mass-produced motor vehicles, transportation is easier and cheaper than ever."
 ABY_nuclear_witchcraft:0 "Nuclear Witchcraft"
 ABY_nuclear_witchcraft_desc:0 "The marriage of science and magic keeps producing most fascinating results. Using magical energy to split the fundamental building blocks of the universe, atoms, results in quite the chain reaction... so obviously, I think we should put this to good use against all our enemies."
 ABY_dominate_donkeys_2:0 "Tame The Stubborn Donkeys"
 ABY_dominate_donkeys_2_desc:0 "It has been many centuries since the donkeys of the south recognized our superiority over them. Their lands naturally belong to our sphere of influence, and any independent donkey state is a direct threat to our vulnerable southern border. As such, I have decreed the military to mobilize in preparation to liberate the donkeys from themselves."
 ABY_invade_yemane:0 "Acquire Slave Horses"
 ABY_invade_yemane_desc:0 "Horses are excellent slaves, being taller and stronger than either ponies or zebras, but they are available in far fewer numbers to us. Thankfully, I know of an excellent way to remedy this. Yemane is a small and vulnerable state not too far away from us with a large population of horses. They shall become fine steeds for catkind!"

 ABY_prepare_for_final_battle_desc:0 "Soon enough, I am sure, Abyssinia's very existence will be threatened by a great power, its vast army armed to the teeth.We must do everything we can to be ready for such a grave threat.

 ABY_the_new_baast_desc:0 "Thanks to my efforts, Abyssinians have ascended and reached greater heights than ever before.

 ABY_gorilla_war:0 "Death By A Thousand Cuts"
 ABY_gorilla_war_desc:0 "Our slaves may not be professional soldiers, and they may be even less experienced fighters than Abyssinian levies or conscripts.

 abyssinia.1.d:0 "The steel battering ram pounded upon the gates of the royal palace and shattered them. A grey, ape-like head with a horned crown peeked inside. "Hellooooo? Anybody home?"\n\nIt was the Storm King.\n\nKing Gomez embraced his wife and consort, Queen Morticia, as the towering armored yeti walked inside accompanied by his masked soldiers. "Hope you don't mind me letting myself in. But I practically own the place already, don't I?" he said with a smug yet casual smirk, then bowed mockingly. "Your majesties. King and Queen of Abyssinia. You should surrender. Now."\nThe glow of the burning city of Panthera shone through the gates. Gomez sighed deeply as his courtiers stared at him, then slowly took off his golden crown and offered it to the yeti. "...Storm King. You have conquered this nation. Abyssinia is yours."\nThe Storm King took the crown, then immediately crushed it. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really into the whole 'ruling' thing. You folks can keep Abyssinia."\nGomez blinked in confusion. "W-what?"\n"I know I call myself a 'King', but frankly, monarchy just isn't my thing. You take over one country, next thing you're dealing with taxes and committees and retirement packages!" With his large hands, he molded the crown into a crude ring which he put on one of his three large fingers. "No, I don't want Abyssinia - just its riches." He leaned closer to Gomez, who reflexively shielded Morticia from him. "The treasure vaults of Abyssinia are filled with strange and exotic wonders, so they say. Magical artifacts, flawless jewels, golden trinkets. I'd like them all, please."\n"You want - our wealth?" Gomez asked.\n"Running a whole armada is expensive, you know. You wouldn't believe the upkeep on all those airships!"\n"You - you can't!" Morticia shrieked. "Abyssinia is a trade nation. We need our wealth to import crops, feed our citizens, build our homes! Please, you must leave us something!"\nThe Storm King frowned melodramatically. "Oh, I will. After I empty your vaults, I'll leave you alone."\n"Wait! You can't! We'll have nothing left! Why have you destroyed Abyssinia?"\nThe Storm King grinned in a way that Gomez wouldn't forget. "Because it was next on my list.""

 abyssinia.2.d:0 "King Gomez snapped awake in his bed, then realized it had just been the same reoccuring dream again. Or nightmare, except it didn't make him feel anything anymore. He groaned and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\nIt was four in the afternoon. He had slept for six hours.\nSlowly, he pushed himself up, yawned and rubbed his burning eyes. Then he simply sat there, staring into nothingness.\nAfter glancing at the door which appeared to be locked, he lowered himself onto the floor and crawled underneath the bed, digging up his secret stash of fresh khatnip leaves. He put a pawful in his mouth, then chewed on it. He purred and rolled on the floor as his pupils dilated and he felt alive again.\nThe door opened.\nGomez immediately pushed himself up, hit his head on the bottom of the bed, and quickly climbed back out. "W-what in the... why didn't you knock?" he mumbled with khatnip in his mouth. His trusted right paw cat, Tsehafe Taezaz, Minister of the Pen, Scribe by Command, Dejen Rees-Moggy, stood in the doorway, completely unfazed.\n"I did, my King, but you didn't seem to hear it. I wanted to ask you if you've finally decided when we can have a meeting."\nGomez spat out the khatnip and straightened himself. "I... haven't. Not today, at least."\n"You can't postpone this forever, your Majesty."\n"I... I know," he replied and lowered his ears.\nDejen rolled his eyes. "Also, I wanted to remind you that your wife has prepared a meal for you. She's been waiting for a while."\nGomez's eyes widened. "Oh, Tartarus! I forgot about it!" He rushed out of the bedroom, running past his advisor, leaving him alone.\nDejen shrugged and headed back to his office."

She knew that he was probably sleeping and regretted not being able to sleep at the same time due to his... changed sleep schedule. At least he usually woke up in time for dinner.\n\nKing Gomez barged into the room. "I-I am so sorry, Tish, I completely forgot about this!"\nMorticia raised an eyebrow. "But we have dinner every day?"\n"Uuuh... yes, but... ah, it doesn't matter." He sat down on the opposite end of the table, his shoulders slumped. "What are we having today."\n"In solidarity with our hungering subjects, we are only having a little bit of kibble. I even arranged for a cat to take a photograph of our meal so it could appear in the newspapers, but... he had to leave after waiting for an hour."\nGomez groaned and rubbed his forehead. "That's my fault, sorry."\nMorticia forced a smile. "It's fine! We can still enjoy the meal."\nThe khatnip was making Gomez's mind foggy. "Sorry, but I'm not really hungry."\n"But you haven't eaten since yesterday?"\n"I know..."\n\nThere was an extended moment of silence as Morticia looked at her husband with concern. Things were only getting worse and worse, she thought. "My darling, you need help. You are sick."\n"Am I? Or do I just see things more clearly than others?" he muttered.\nMorticia sighed. "I understand you better than anyone else, and I can tell something is wrong. And I just want you to be happy again."\nGomez stared blankly into his plate of kibble, then replied:"

 abyssinia.4.t:0 "The Gathering Of The Nobles"
 abyssinia.4.d:0 "The decrepit stone mansion of the Catwe dynasty was usually a quiet place, yet now it was filled with hundreds of cats, most of whom were servants. A dozen litters, including elaborate palanquins as well as sedan chairs, were waiting for their owners outside along with their slave-carriers. A few of the slaves, who were horses and ponies, were not carriers but steeds and used the opportunity to relax and take off their saddles.\n\nIn the meantime, the nobles had all gathered in a conference room. The owner of the mansion and the host of the meeting, Catrina of House Catwe, was filing her claws. One of the aristocats coughed. "It is impolite to keep us waiting, Catrina," Tsahife Lam Tardar Sourpuss, muttered.\nCatrina admired the sharpness of her claws and smiled. "I am the host of this house, and I decide when the meeting starts. And it starts now." She turned to look at the nobles. At least half of the most important aristocats in the Kingdom had gathered here, and all of them supported her claim to the throne. "I am glad all of you accepted my invitation, as we need to decide our next course of action. Thankfully, I have the perfect plan to depose our indecisive King, who is clearly unfit to rule."\n"You always promise us the sun and the moon," Tardar replied dryly, "but you are no alicorn."\nNot yet, Catrina thought, and wondered if Tardar really was always this grumpy, or if her face was stuck in a perpetual frown. "Unlike Gomez, I keep my promises, dear Tardar. Now listen, I have much to explain...""

 abyssinia.5.d:0 "Gomez was slumped in his chair as he listened to his wife explain her plans. While he admired her hopefulness and enthusiasm, he also felt jealous. Why couldn't he feel the same way anymore?\n\n"So I've contacted the best doctors in the Kingdom," Morticia said, "and they said they'd be more than happy to diagnose your condition. Maybe your mood is linked to some sickness? Alternatively, you might just need a break from everything. Rulership can be very stressful, after all. I've asked various cats about where you could go on vacation, and one of them suggested visiting the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela in Jirati. I sent a message to the priests there and they'd be more than happy to welcome you. If you leave, I could stay here and act as regent. Lastly, we have plenty of relatives who are concerned about you. We could hold a family gathering and see if they can help you feel any better. How do these options sound, my darling? Which one do you think is best?"\n\nGomez blinked slowly. "Uuuuh... they're all fine, I guess."\nMorticia's smile faded slightly. "Well, you have to pick one, as we can't do all of them at once."\nHe rubbed his aching forehead. "Ugh, alright. Let me think...""

"Who are you and who granted you permission to be seated in my workspace?"\nThe stranger chuckled and steepled her paws. "I granted permission to myself. I am the rightful owner of this place, after all."\nHe raised an eyebrow. "...Catrina of House Catwe?"\n"Mhm, you know your history, at least. Let me cut to the chase: I want to acquire information."\nHis eyes narrowed. "Of what kind?"\n"Oh, you see, I have certain plans, and to fulfill them, I need some... incriminating facts about our beloved King and liege. With evidence, preferably."\n"And why would I give you anything?"\n"Tell me, are you pleased with the rule of King Gomez? You can be honest with me."\nDejen hesitated rather than answering.\n"None of us are," Catrina hissed. "And you can help me to replace him with someone better."\n"Yourself?"\nCatrina laughed. "Hah, that is besides the point! Just give me what I want, and I'll take care of the rest."\nDejen took a deep breath. He had a tough decision to make."

 abyssinia.7.d:0 "The finest cat doctors of Abyssinia had gathered in the palace, ready to serve their lord and liege. King Gomez was subjected to several hours of careful analysis, questioning and diagnosis as they checked every part of his body and wanted to hear his entire life story. By the end of it, he was completely exhausted, but at least the medical experts had enough data now to come to some sort of conclusion. They all agreed that he had depression or melancholia. However, they did not agree what the cause was or how he should be treated.\n"He clearly has an imbalance of humours in his body, an excess of black bile!" one doctor said. "Some bloodletting should do the trick."\n"Nonsense, this is clearly a case of demonic possession!"\n"Possession has scientifically been proven to not cause depression! Rather, the demon treats the body like a puppet. Besides, we cats have inherently low magical energies and thus are very unlikely to be possessed."\n"I think a combination of ferrous iodide, arsenic, ergot, strophantin and cinchona should do the trick of curing him."\n"Opium alone should suffice."\n"No! He needs a lobotomy!"\n"What about electroshock therapy?"\n"Untested new technology sounds dangerous."\n"Hmmm... how about this then?" The doctor gave Gomez a large poster. It had an animal cat hanging from a tree branch, accompanied by the text "Hang in there!".\nGomez groaned. Everything they proposed sounded terrible.\n"I'm sorry my darling," Morticia said, "but we couldn't afford to get better doctors from Equestria to come here. How about we try something else?""

There was no railroad in the region, so he and his entourage had arrived by boat in Catemte, then taken a winding unpaved road up the mountains. He had been seated in an expensive imported car before it broke down, and then was carried on a palanquin by servants who were quickly exhausted. Unlike the nobles, he did not have sturdy equines as slaves, but rather free cats who were paid a salary. And with an empty treasury, they hadn't been paid enough to carry him all the way up. In the end, the King was walking.\n\nOn the way to the temples they passed by an isolated village. The locals poured out of their houses to see the King with their own eyes. One of them was a young kitten, who was wearing rags and appeared emaciated. He approached Gomez and asked: "You're the King, right? Why do you look so sad?"\nGomez sighed. "I carry the weight of the Kingdom on my shoulders, little one."\n"But you wear such fancy clothes and jewels! And I bet you have lots of food and a HUGE mansion and the BIGGEST ball of yarn in the world!"\n"I... have some of those, I suppose."\n"Then how can you be sad? If I was you, I'd be so happy!"\nThis kitten was still so naïve and simple, Gomez thought. "You already seem happy yourself, despite having nothing."\nThe kitten giggled. "I have lots of fun with my friends!"\nThe King had a faint, wistful smile. He took out a gold coin which he had hidden from the Storm King inside his robes, and gave it to the kitten. "Here, have this. Go buy some food for yourself, it must be expensive these days.""

At least, the Storm King hadn't emptied the pantry, though Queen Morticia had wished for them to eat less food so she could instead donate some of it to hungry peasants. Her relatives didn't listen.\n\nThe constant chatter and noise of cats of all ages was deafening, and King Gomez felt like he was going to get a headache. His already minimal appetite had become non-existent.\n"What's wrong Gomy?" his old uncle asked. "Not going to touch your food?"\n"It's probably because he's 'depressed'!" his cousin twice removed said.\n"Depression isn't real," his sister-in-law said. "Snap out of it!"\n"He has it easy!" his brother-in-law hissed. "I lost my home, my leg and my wealth during the Storm King's invasion, but you don't see me frowning!"\n"Yeah, don't be sad, Gomy!" his aunt said. "Just look on the bright side of life and appreciate all the good things in it!"\n"You know, most of Zebrica is doing worse than we are," his second cousin thrice removed said. "Think of all the starving foals in the Great Lakes!"\n"It's all in your head," mother-in-law said. "Why do you let it affect you so much?"\nHis half-drunk godfather drank some katikala and laughed. "He needs to have more fun in life, that's all!"\n\nGomez groaned and visibly shrunk. His wife, who was sitting next to him, noticed this. "Can all of you be quiet?!" she hissed at their relatives, then turned to whisper into Gomez's ear. "This was a mistake. We should try something else...""

He is clearly incapable of ruling his Kingdom anymore, which begs the question: why does that disgusting cousin-marrier cling on to the throne?

Gomez himself appeared unnerved, but remained silent.\nCatrina continued. "May I remind you that his inbred dynasty seized power from MY family, and then proceeded to trample on your ancient rights and privileges. And for what? Our Kingdom lies in ruins, but the Clawomons clearly do not care!"\nAs more and more nobles laughed and cheered, Gomez had enough.

It was Gomez's hidden stash.\nThe room erupted into laughter and shouting. Gomez's eyes widened in shock. Someone close to him had betrayed him and exposed his secret. His lips quievered and he stood up. The room went silent. "You know what, you are right about everything. I give up.

Families first visit the local temples, then share a meal of chicken meat covered in sauce. As the sun begins to set, cats don their finest clothes, gather flowers and offer bouquets to their friends while singing songs.

The crowd went silent.\n\n"The King has made a very important decision which will now be revealed to the public. He is in no condition to hold a speech so I will do it on his behalf, reading what he has written." He raised the paper and read:\n\n""My beloved subjects,\n\nAfter much deliberation, I have finally made a painful but necessary decision. I declare that I have voluntarily abdicated in favour of my very beloved and dear wife, Queen Morticia. This I do with all my heart.\n\nI want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country which, as King of Abyssinia, I have for nine years tried to serve.

They had been carved directly into the stone centuries ago by King Felibela of the Catwe dynasty who wanted to create a holy city for his Kingdom. The temples and the nearby town had been named after him, but since the Clawomons had deposed his dynasty, the area had been mostly neglected. The town was insignificant and the temples were maintained only by the priests who continued to live in them. However, recently the location had become famous and rejuvenated by visitors.\n\nUnlike Felibela, King Gomez was not feeling rejuvenated. Now that he had seen the temples, he wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. It all started to feel like a waste of time, so he sat down on a rock. Nearby, an old statue of Baast stood, the four-legged creator goddess of catkind. He looked at it and wondered if she had made a mistake granting sapience to his ancestors. Maybe he'd be happier if he was a wild cat, chasing mice and what not?\n\n"And who are you?"\nGomez turned his head and saw an old grey cat adorned in pure white robes. "You don't recognize me?" he replied. "I'm the King of Abyssinia... unfortunately."\n"I did not ask for your title. Titles are imaginary and meaningless."\nThe King frowned. "My name is Gomez Mawkonnen."\n"Names are also imaginary and meaningless. Who really are you?"\nGomez blinked in confusion.\n"You clearly need help with answering that question.

Besides, your ancestor deposed my family in quite the illegal fashion."\n"The Catwes were the ones who seized the Kingdom without any right to do so!"\n"Tsk tsk, how about we leave history to the chroniclers. What matters most is the present moment. Let us proceed with the vote! Every noble who wishes for me to succeed Gomez to the throne, raise your paw."\nMajority of the nobles did so.

He paid little attention to his comfortable couch and instead allowed his gaze to wander around the room.\n"Tell me, Gomez, what exactly is bothering you so much that you seek refuge here?" Tekle asked in a gentle tone, sitting on a worn out wooden chair that looked like it could snap and break at any moment.\n"Everything," Gomez snapped, still not looking at the priest. "I couldn't even afford to pay servants to carry me here, but I had to walk like a peasant."\n"Hm, I see. Some cats do say taking a walk helps clear up your mind," he said and chuckled.\n"Very funny. If you were asking for money like them, I couldn't give you anything either. The state treasury is empty."\n"Because of the Storm King?"\n"Yes!" the black cat shouted, now intensely glaring at the priest. "That grey monkey ruined everything! I had spent years trying to fix the problems that were threatening the Kingdom, only for some mad warlord to come and ruin everything. Who knows if something like that happens again?" He deflated in an instant and slouched on the couch.\nThe old cat nodded. "And you felt fine before this?"\n"I... well, I did feel better, I suppose."\n"So like many other cats, you faced hardship and setback and your house of cards came crumbling down. You have no desire to keep going and rebuild everything you've lost?"\nGomez squirmed like a cat being forced into a bath. "Everything is ruined... I'm not sure I can fix it all. I am a puss with big boots to fill. I don't think a laycat like you could even comprehend the scale of my problems."\n"Failure is an opportunity to learn and do better. Besides, have you ever tried kicking down and destroying an ant hill? Do the ants simply give up? No, they rebuild their homes no matter how many times you destroy them, without any doubt or hesitation."\n"Are you saying I am lesser than an ant?" Gomez asked with an offended frown.\nTekle sighed.

This was difficult as he still spent most of his time inside his bedroom and all the other cats continued to treat him like a King. So when Tekle invited him again, he was unsure if his advice had been of any use.\nGomez knocked on the wooden door of his house and it was soon opened by the elderly cat who smiled warmly. "Good to see you, Gomez," the priest said. "How have you been?"\n"I, uh... I've been fine, I suppose."\n"Did anything change after you stopped thinking about your duties?"\n"Well..." he frowned and pondered, examining his own emotions. "I do feel a little... less stressed."\n"Good. Come in, let us have a proper talk now."\n\nThe two sat down again even as Gomez moved hesitantly.\n"So, I think both of us understand the core problem," Tekle spoke. "When you face failure, your feelings take over and you're no longer the one in control."\nThe black cat's ears perked up, as if he had been offended again. But he quickly calmed down after a moment of reflection. "...I suppose you're right, yes."\n"Emotions are like fire: they are good servants but bad masters. Tell me, does the past haunt you? Do you feel sadness or anger over everything that happened to you?"\nAs much as it seemed like he did not want to answer, he did: "Yes. I even have dreams about the past... or nightmares."\nThe priest nodded thoughtfully. "Baast once said: 'Hanker not after the past, nor fantasize over the future, for the past has been left behind and the future has not been reached'. You do not live in the present, but regret the past and fear the future being a repetition of the past. How can one live like that?"\nGomez's mouth formed a strange smile. "Indeed, this is hardly a life worth living."\n"Then make it worthwhile," Tekle replied. "You must dethrone your feelings, tame your mind and become once more your own master, the King of your mind's Kingdom. I can help you, Gomez. Whether you believe it or not. Just never give up, and you'll make it."\nThe so-called "King" stared at him, saying nothing."

Not everything needs a goal or a purpose. Walking and wandering helps to stimulate your body and thus your mind."\n""Ah... well, I'm not really feeling better yet."\n"Does a seed sprout into a tree in a day? No, and you have to water it often and take good care of it."\nHe sighed. "I suppose I'll have to be patient, then."\n"Exactly. You must learn self-control in general. As Baast said: 'Taming the mind to be effective is good. A tamed mind brings happiness'. It is the difference between a feral cat and an Abyssinian. I know how to train this ability, and I know you can learn it."\nGomez nodded slowly and didn't say anything for a while. Then he asked: "I thought priests like you are only good at reciting the Three Scriptures and nothing more."\n"Our duty is to be the spiritual pillar of society. Baast gifted us sapient minds, giving us the ability to escape the cycle of suffering that animals are doomed to endure. However, many cats do not know how to use their gifts. It is our responsibility to tend to these minds and treat them when they are sick." The old cat sighed. "But I know that the world is changing.

But I just... want to decide when it happens."\n"So you are afraid, then. Otherwise you would've already done it. Come, there's nothing to fear. This rock has been here for thousands of years. In that time, countless Kingdoms have risen and fallen, countless Kings and Queens have lived and died. This rock has outlasted them all, and it will outlast us too."\nGomez gulped and climbed, sitting down next to Tekle.\n"There we go. Now, this is a great place to focus on the present moment. Sit like I do, take this stance. Like that, yes. Then breathe, control it. Slow and steady. Feel your breaths, feel the air in your lungs. Next you can extend your awareness further. How does the rest of your body feel? How does your mind feel? Register emotions within you. You cannot grasp fog, you must hold solid things. As such your thoughts and feelings must become controllable. Think of something that makes you unhappy or distressed. Then think of what makes you happy. Face them. Permit them to pass over you and through you. Your feelings don't define who you are. You define yourself. Don't let the negative compounding thoughts control you. Don't judge yourself if you can't succeed at first. Don't judge yourself at all. Every sapient creature is flawed.

Nevertheless, he still didn't feel happy, and he doubted if he was ever going to be. But he didn't feel too unhappy either. He had always wanted to learn how to control his emotions. Maybe this was the way.\n\n"We have made good progress", the priest, who sat on the opposite end of the table, said. "But I doubt it is anywhere near enough."\n"I'm afraid I'll have to leave. I've spent too long here already."\n"What, you don't want to procrastinate on your duties anymore?" he asked with a smirk.\nThe King sighed. "I just want to see my Queen again."\n"Good. But if you do decide to return to your regular life, remember that you need to constantly continue to manage your feelings. If you don't, they will only get worse and worse."\n"I've noticed," Gomez mumbled and drank more coffee.\n"We all have to do things we don't want to do. This is as true for a King as it is true for a slave. Yet do not let your duty overcome you. When work is over, you are just a cat like me. Remember that."\n"But my resposibility is far greater than anycat else's." He thought of the famished kitten at that village and felt guilty about it.\n"You are right.

I wasn't sure either," Gomez replied.\n"Well, because this has taken long enough to happen, I will get straight to the point. My overview will cover the internal and external situation of the Kingdom. I will start with the former." He had placed a large map of Abyssinia behind him and had a pointing stick in his paw. "When I wrote this presentation, my largest concern was the nobility, but since then their threat has diminished. Nevertheless, many nobles remain dissatisfied with your rule for understandable reasons. They will need to be reminded of your legitimacy and competence. The second internal issue is slavery. There is every reason to outlaw it fully and emancipate our million slaves, but the aforementioned nobles strongly oppose this. Yet not doing so will lead to constant slave revolts that are costly to pacify." He pointed at Coltoba with his stick. "The third issue is Manedalusia. Tensions remain over the conflict we had with Maregypt years ago, and the local secessionist movement has utilized recent chaos to grow in strength. The fourth issue is famine. Without funds to import food, our limited domestic production isn't enough. But we have many ways to salvage the situation before it's too late. Speaking of lack of funds, that's the fifth and final internal issue, which will require extensive and quick reforms. Next, the external ones. First, conflicts in Saddle Arabia and Great Lakes have greatly reduced our trade income," he said, pointing at the two regions which appeared deceptively unified on the outdated map, "making it difficult to refill our treasury." Then he pointed at Katren. "Second, the monarchist Wingbardian government still sees us as part of their sphere of influence." His stick moved eastwards towards the Neighle. "Third, Maregypt's revanchists continue to urge their government to 'liberate' Coltoba from our rule. At this rate, they might launch a military offensive against us." He stopped for a moment, as if to think about what to say, then pointed at the lands south of Abyssinia. "Lastly, our relations with the donkey states of Asstyria and Anseruk are... fine, in fact, at least for now." He turned to look at Gomez again. "Any questions, my King?""

This has caused severe economic issues such as deflation, bank runs and a decline of economic activity. These issues are so severe, in fact, that we should've implemented reforms as soon as possible."\nGomez rubbed his forehead with his claws. "I am sorry."\n"Apology accepted. Now, you have a decision to make. I have investigated our options and consolidated them into three. Two of them are similar: we peg the value of our currency to the value of another one. This will bring financial stability and make it easy to loan funds from abroad, but will make us more dependent on whatever currency we choose. My two proposals are the Equestrian bit and the Skyfallian idol. Both are reliable, valuable and extensively used in global trade. Either of them would function as our reserve currency. The third option is to simply not have a fixed currency at all. A floating exchange rate would be a more unorthodox choice, but would allow us to recover more quickly from the crisis and enable us to increase our money supply as much as necessary. This could lead to excessive inflation, however, so we'd have to be more careful than with the other two alternatives."\n\nGomez frowned.

Have you seen Tekle Maw'a anywhere?"\nThe robed cat was somewhat startled by this. "Your majesty? I am honoured by your attention." She kneeled before him in respect.\nGomez appeared uncomfortable. "Could you... answer my question?"\nThe priest immediately stood up. "Yes of course, sir! Unfortunately, the Abuna had a stroke and passed away.

 abyssinia.55.t:0 "Baastism In A Nutshell"
 abyssinia.55.d:0 "Baastism is a name commonly used by outsiders to refer to the traditional racial faith of Abyssinian cats. It is centered around Baast, a legendary four-legged sapient cat who allegedly overthrew the Tyrant King Anubis of ancient Anugypt and sacrificed herself to create the Abyssinian race. As this was the end of Baast's ninth and final life, she is considered to be a dead deity. Baastism therefore focuses on following her way of life rather than praying for salvation or fearing divine retribution.\n\nThe core principle of Baastism is the cycle of rebirth, where a cat can live nine lives before facing eternal oblivion and non-existence. Baast escaped this fate through achieving everlasting metaphysical existence by eliminating desire and the self. Baastists thus seek to emulate her by purifying their minds in a similar manner. They do not believe that animals, such as house cats, are capable of this and see sapience as Baast's gift that they must use to liberate themselves from suffering and nothingness.\n\nThe religion has a priesthood who maintain isolated temples that are used for worship and meditation. The core function of the priests is teaching others to live like Baast did and help them achieve enlightenment. There are very few, if any, Baastists who are not Abyssinian cats, due to the focus on Baast's relationship with her "creations". Those non-cats who do follow Baast's way of life do so hoping to achieve similar salvation, seeking to live as virtuously as her.\n\nThere are several unorthodox variants of Baastism which have few followers. They interpret the legend of Baast's life differently, some even claiming she still exists and actively intervenes in temporal affairs like a regular god. While they are considered heretics, they are not actively persecuted most of the time."

It was once again time to read numerous petitions and letters from the nobility.

Sometimes Morticia wondered if it'd be easiest to just let go of Manedalusia entirely, rather than bother with trying to integrate the equines. In the letter, the Basha demanded the [ROOT.ABY_king_loc_cap] to urgently dismiss ponies from the [Root.ABY_royal_loc_nocap] army. He claimed that the pony auxiliaries were unreliable, prone to desertion and covertly cooperated with the underground resistance movement in Coltoba.

She had been practically disowned by her family and friends who had refused to believe her justification for it. They had seen her as a traitor, and warned that one day her Abyssinian officers would order her to shoot at her fellow ponies.\n\nShe wished she could tell them that she had now joined the underground anti-Abyssinian resistance movement. Over the years, she had gathered as much intel as possible, learning how the Abyssinian army worked from the inside, and convinced other fellow auxiliaries to join her cause. This ensured she was swiftly accepted into the ranks of the rebels when the time came. When she finally deserted, she did not do so alone, but with dozens of other defectors. They stole hundreds of weapons and plenty of ammunition from the Abyssinian armory in Coltoba, and met with resistance fighters at a secret meeting place. There, they formally swore an oath to fight for the resistance until Manedalusia was freed or until they died. Of course, she had sworn an oath to [ABY.GetNameDef] as well, but ultimately her family had been right. She was indeed a traitor and an oathbreaker. Just for the opposite side.\n\nAlready on the next day, Iron Muhtal led a daring raid which was part of a larger coordinated offensive by the resistance movement.

Otherwise, let them step unto oblivion."\nThe soldiers then pushed the slaves down from the cliff along with their rocks. All slaves fell in unison.

Then, her claw pointed at the central tower. "That there was the storage place of ancient magico-medical scrolls. The Storm King probably thought they had some value, despite us cats not even being able to use magic like other races. Meanwhile my mansion is in poor condition and has nothing particularly valuable inside it. When the villagers refused to give the sacred scrolls, the yeti tried to take them by force.

To tell you the truth, I liked you better before you were powerful."\nThe Queen's ears folded and her pupils narrowed into sharp slits. She took out a vial and swallowed a droplet of green potion.\n"Catrina, I-" Rep managed to say before Catrina blew air out of her mouth with the strength of a storm. He was sent flying backwards, the book dropping from his grasp, all the pictures inside pulled out of their frames and scattering with the wind."

 abyssinia.142.d:0 "As the feast in Catrina's manor was ongoing, Fit'awrari Humbert excused himself and left the dining table. As Catrina glanced at him in curiosity, Ras Thurston distracted her by telling how great of a ruler she was. The diplocat wandered the empty and quiet hallways of the manor, examining everything closely.\nEventually, he entered a living room with a bookcase. He took a closer look and saw it was filled to the brim with Abyssinian literature classics, history books, encyclopedias and foreign engineering manuals. Several copies of each, in fact, as if to fill out the shelves. Humbert frowned and then examined the frame of the bookcase. He grabbed it with his claws and tried pulling it, but it didn't budge. The only item on the shelves that wasn't a book was a small statue of Baast. "The One who Opens Her Consciousness", Humbert muttered and pulled the statuette. There was a loud click and the bookcase swung open, revealing a passage of stone behind it.\nCarefully, he entered inside and walked down a winding stairway that led him deep into the earth. As he descended, he could hear a strange cacophony, clanking and grinding of metal, coming from below and getting louder with each step. Finally, he reached the bottom and emerged in a large cavern, almost entirely occupied by a steaming behemoth of bronze, hundreds of slaves swarming around it like ants, hauling carts full of weed and flasks of glass.\nHe stared at the sight with his mouth and eyes wide open for a while, before a voice coming from behind startled him.\n"Do you like what you see?"

"I've been working on it for a long time, but didn't really start using it until the Storm King invaded our country."\n"You mean ordered your slaves to use it?" Humbert asked, unthreatened by her and the guards.\n"Oh come now, this is better than back-breaking work at a plantation. Besides, the purpose here is far nobler than the vain pursuit of profit."\n"I was going to ask about that next."\n"Aren't you inquisitive? You're the first outsider to find out. In fact, I allowed it to happen because eventually, I plan to stop hiding any of this."\n"Just tell me what this is all for."\nThe Queen chuckled. "The purpose is our survival. Tell me, esteemed Fit'awrari, do you believe in cats having magical abilities?"\n"Everyone knows we don't have those."\n"Everyone is wrong. With the help of a zebra slave, who happened to be a potion brewer, I discovered a formula that can unlock our dormant and innate magical powers. The main ingredient is witchweed, if you were wondering."\nHumbert said nothing and stared at her in shock.\n"And what does this have to do with our survival? Well, you're one of the more civilized nobles, so you should know our history. Foreign powers have pushed us around for six hundred years, because our nation is too weak. And why's that? Because there are four million cats without any magic against the rest of the world. The only way to secure our sovereignty is through power. The Clawomons were too foolish to realize this, so I decided to take over. This project is the only thing that can save us from being wiped off the map."\nHumbert continued his silence, digesting what he had just heard.\n"So, will you keep my small secret until it's time to reveal it?" Catrina raised a paw, then revealed her claws. "Trust me, you do not want to get in the way of my plans.""

"What took you so long?"\nThe slave looked up with terrified eyes. "I-I spilled some on the way and had to get another dose..."\n"WHAT?" the cat screamed. "You lame mule! Do you know how valuable that substance is?!"\nRep quickly stepped in front of the slave and looked at her with pleading eyes. "Please, calm down, it was less than one dose, I'll make sure it gets replaced!" He quickly took the bowl from the slave and presented it to Catrina. "Here, take it!"\nShe narrowed her eyes at him and slowly took the bowl. "Fine, I'll forgive him this time." She brought the bowl to her mouth and drank all its contents, grimacing slightly from the taste. "I wasn't planning to use this potion in such a large quantity yet, but the premature invasion by Wingbardy forces me to adapt." With a sudden surge of strength, she crushed the bowl in her paws into dust and was completely unharmed by it. "Soon enough, I'll be ready to distribute this to my soldiers as well... then we will become UNSTOPPABLE!"

She was breathing heavily and looked at him with pleading, desperate eyes. "Rep, sweetie... h-have you seen the keys to the potion storage room?"\nRep frowned. "Uh, why are you asking?"\nShe gulped. "I haven't had any of the potion for days... the withdrawal is starting to kick in..." Her voice was almost whimpering and she was on the verge of tears.\nRep appeared sad all of a sudden. "I... I think I've seen it somewhere! Wait here, I'll go look for it!" He frantically ran out of the room and headed down a hallway to his own bedroom. He pulled off the blanket on his bed, threw away his pillow and grabbed a key he had hidden there, then quickly rushed back to Catrina. "Here! I found it!"\nAs soon as he presented it to her, she grabbed it and ran on all fours to the potion storage, her paws trembling as she unlocked it. Once inside, she emptied a full vial of Witchweed Potion into her mouth, letting out a relaxed sigh. "Where was the key, anyways?"\n"I, uh, seems you dropped it on the floor..." Rep replied, trying to remain calm.\n"Hm, strange. I'll have to make sure to not lose it again. Thank you, Rep," she said and grinned.\nSomething about her expression made Rep's brow quiver.

"Can't you see I am in the middle of an important meeting?" she replied, not turning to face him.\n"This is more important," Rep said.\nCatrina sighed. "Leave us," she muttered to the generals, who bowed in respect and departed the meeting hall. The great magocrat of Abyssinia then turned to face her most loyal servant. "What could possibly be more important than the plans for my next military campaign?"\n"Our relationship," Rep stated bluntly. "Frankly, I can't take this anymore, Catrina. I've done everything you've asked me to do, I've tried to be a good friend, but after I saw what happened to all our neighbouring countries, I just can't."\nCatrina's face twisted as she tried her best to control her emotions. "So you're abandoning me?"\n"N-no, no..." he sighed heavily. "I wanted to give you one last chance. To choose between me... or that Machine. I swear, after you had your slaves construct it, the Witchweed potions changed you. I hardly recognize you anymore."\nShe forced a chuckle. "I can't believe you're doing this to me, Rep."\n"I am sorry, but I've reached my limit. Destroy the machine, release all your slaves and keep as much witchweed potion as you need to avoid withdrawal symptoms while you gradually stop using it, or I will resign. And probably move back to the Dragonlands, too."\nCatrina gritted her fangs and grimaced. Rep simply looked back at her, his eyes weary yet begging for her to make the right choice.

Find the troublesome Clawomons and bring them to me dead or alive." She turned to look closely at one of the operatives, glaring at his stoic face. "But it won't be easy. Their resistance is well organized and distributed across the nation. Especially in the remote highland villages, there are many civilians supporting and sheltering these terrorists and rebels. They can blend into the populace and avoid detection. They use modern radios for communication and use secret channels as well as encrypted messages. Do you understand the challenge ahead of you?"\nThe cat she was staring at replied. "Yes ma'am!"\n"Good." Catrina stepped back so all of them could see her. "Nevertheless, I believe you can do it. I will provide you all the support and resources that I can afford. I expect you to go through all of Abyssinia with a comb, searching every nook and cranny. Think of it as... hunting rats hiding in holes. If you succeed, I will reward you most generously. Understood?"\n"Yes ma'am!" they all shouted in unison.\n"Good. You are dismissed.

Countless buildings and monuments, finest displays of Arabian architecture, with its domes and towers... all damaged or in ruins. She also saw much what the state media would never dare to show to the Abyssinian populace back home: piles of charred corpses of civilians, huge holes dug for mass graves, the identification process for Abyssinian casualties where unrecognizable piles of flesh were closely inspected, field hospitals filled to the brim with wailing wounded. And worst of all was the smell. It smelled like death everywhere she went, even in the relatively undamaged parts of the city that had been spared from the fighting.\n\nEscorted by the Crown Guard, she came to the central square in front of a palace that had once belonged to the Grand Prince of Saddle Arabia. From this building, the order to invade Abyssinia had come, all those centuries ago. In the middle of the square stood a flagpole, and soldiers saluted it as the Abyssinian flag was raised. There was no wind to make it flutter, so it was like a bloodied rag hanging from a stick.\n"Will you hold your speech?" The general of the Crown Guard asked. "We've cleaned up a spot for it, and the cameras and microphones are ready to record it."\nCatrina snapped out of her thoughts. "Huh? Um... I don't... I think I'll have to cancel the speech. I don't feel like holding it."\n"Ma'am? Are you sick? Do you need medical help?"\n"No, let the doctors focus on the wounded. Tell the reporters the speech is cancelled, and escort me back to the airport."\nDespite the general's best efforts to remain emotionless, there was a brief confused frown, followed by a deep bow. "As you wish, your majesty."\nThe general then left, leaving her standing there all alone. She looked around herself and realized no one was paying attention to her.

In the courtyard, a fountain sputtered crystal clear water as couples danced around it.\n\nOn top of a stairwell leading down to the courtyard, Catrina stood hesitantly. Her hair was cut short and she wore a long dress she hadn't worn in decades. She trembled a little as a result of withdrawal from Witchweed potion, but managed to keep it under control.\n"You look beautiful, Catrina," Rep said, wearing a tuxedo and a top hat.\n"Do you really think so, darling?" she asked shyly.\n"Just like the good old days!"\nA spotlight suddenly focused on Catrina, and Rep took her paw. "Go on, Catrina! Your public awaits!"\nShe frowned. "I'd be happy to, Rep, dear, but you're standing on my dress!" she hissed.\nRep looked down and realized she was correct. He lifted his leg and gave her an embarrased smile. "Excuse me."\n\nThe two walked down the stairs together as the cats below turned to look up at them and cheer.

"As such, we will now formally place our recently activated militias under your command."\n"That was the plan for this meeting, yes."\nA cat in glasses raised her paw. "Actually, the Abyssinian Socialist Party wished to also discuss preliminary post-war political plans."\n"Nice alliteration," Sharp remarked.\n"From what we've gathered, your planned policies align with our socialist values, while maintaining the republican form of government desired by the Popular League of Abyssinia."\nShe tilted her head and raised an eyebrow.

Already her anger had been fully replaced with a friendly smile. "Sorry about that. Please, sit down."\nThe dark grey cat sat down on a chair in front of her desk, his posture stiff and upright. He said nothing.\n"I've... invited you here, because I would like you to be part of our new government. With the previous regime, you did a fine job as a minister, so it would be a shame to let your talents go to waste."\nOne of his eyebrows rose slightly.\nSeeing this, Sharp continued. "Besides, majority of the current positions are occupied by other races. We need more cats, so the majority population of Abyssinia has more representation."\nDejen did not raise his other eyebrow.\nSharp sighed and rubbed her forehead with her hoof. "Okay, okay, I can't force you... so I'll just have to be honest." She sank in her chair like a deflated balloon. "I need your help."\nNow Dejen's second eyebrow rose too. "For what?" he finally asked.\n"Everything!" Sharp exclaimed, raising her forelegs for emphasis. "I'm a soldier, not a politician! I have such big ideas and dreams, but I have no clue how to make them into reality. Heck, I didn't even know what socialism was until recently, yet apparently, that's my 'ideology' or whatever!"\nThe cat adjusted his glasses. "I see. And what makes you think I'd be willing to help you? Why do you even want me? I've served monarchs for my entire life."\nSharp climbed onto the table and stared at him intensely. "Without someone like you, I won't be able to keep this country intact. You should've seen the Conference. It's a miracle it didn't turn into a hooffight!"\n"You should've thought about that before disrupting the political order of Abyssinia."\n"Look, I'm sorry! Because of me, you lost your position of power. But I am offering to give it back. I know there are good cats out there, who want to make Abyssinia into a better place. Trust me, I want that too. I want to ensure that never, NEVER again will there be slavery here, or a war with Maregypt, or conflict in Manedalusia. But I can't do that alone."

 abyssinia.161.d:0 "The new Abyssinian transitional government that recently overthrew the ruling monarchy has made us an intriguing offer. They have completely abolished slavery, and now ask for our cooperation in arranging the return of former slaves back to their home countries. Abyssinia has been a center of slave trade for a long time, especially after feline slavery was outlawed a century ago. Many of these slaves originated from our country, having either become prisoners of war or captured by greedy slave traders. Now that they have become free, they wish to return back home.\n\nWhile the return of our former citizens is welcome, it is likely they'd cause some minor societal upheaval upon their return. Many of them were declared missing and as such have lost their properties and were legally treated as dead, so they would cause quite the bureaucratic mess when they arrive. However, any relatives they have would be greatly pleased to see their loved ones after such a long time, so it would probably be worth the trouble."

Both the Abyssinian and [From.GetAdjective] governments cooperated to ensure their travel was safe and provided whatever support they needed. Interestingly, the reaction of the native Abyssinian populace was not entirely negative. Especially the feline commoners were happy to see another race leaving their homeland, and some even helped the former slaves.

While this calmed some of them, others decided to make a risky journey back home on their own, without any support or guarantee of safety upon their arrival. Nothing was heard of them afterwards. Interestingly, the reaction of the native Abyssinian populace was not entirely positive.

"Why is it so hard for everyone to agree on something?"\n"Such is the nature of deliberative decision-making," Dejen explained and put his papers aside. "It seems you'll have the final say on the matter, as the head of state."\n"I thought I could take it easy after all my hard work organizing the revolution, but I guess not." She sighed. "To be fair, it is a tough decision to make."\n"No it's not," Sennacherib said with a snort filled with contempt. "Kill 'em all and be done with it."\nDejen never glared at anyone, except now.\n"We have shed enough blood already," Sharp replied. "At least I have. But it is true that they are a potential threat to our security-"\nThe grey cat was quick to interrupt. "They could be useful to us. I can act as an intermediary and ensure only those without strong loyalties to the monarchy will serve you."\nSennacherib gnarled. "Are you serious? You should be grateful we spared you, and instead you just want to save your friends from justice!"\n"I assure you, I only have friends outside of work, and they are all civilians. I am not acting out of self-interest, I am simply trying to ensure a smooth transition to a new form of government."\nSharp groaned.

I was hoping this meeting would help me with that."\n"Just pick me and be done with it," the donkey replied. "You know well that thanks to my meticulous planning and firm leadership, the revolutionary army wasn't just a loose gang of bandits, but a properly organized force of guerilla fighters."\n"Allow me to be honest, ma'am," Fahd said, "He is not particularly popular in the ranks. During the rebellion, I had multiple petitions of soldiers asking to be transitioned from his command to mine."\nSennacherib grunted angrily. "Bah!

"I have no desire to live in the kind of nation you're making.

Then she had dragged her hooves to a yet another meeting, this time with the transitional government. In the end, no agreement or consensus had been reached in either. Utterly exhausted, she headed out to share a drink with her friend.\n\n"You look like you went to Tartarus, wrestled a bugbear, and then came back," Fahd Al-Kasaar joked, laughed heartily and drank from his cup of coffee.\n"I sure feel like it," Sharp mumbled and sipped from her tankard of honey wine.\n"It's a shame working at a coffee plantation ruined coffee for you. Drinking it lifts your spirits!"\n"So does this," she said with a smirk and sipped again.\n"Fair enough. Say, I know you don't like talking about work, but wouldn't it ease your burden to do so?"\nShe sighed. "Oh, it's all about this Manedalusia dispute. I was going to just hoof it over to its rightful owners, but apparently neither Manedalusians nor the government agreed on that.

While many see this as final confirmation that Wingbardy has been driven out of the Abyssinian mainland, the Wingbardian government disagrees and has formally declared war on Abyssinia, seeking to re-impose the treaty by force.

 abyssinia_news.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After several years of tolerating foreign occupation, the government of Abyssinia has now decided to reclaim the disputed port town of Katren by force. It was originally seized by Wingbardy in 1006 under questionable circumstances and secured with the controversial Treaty of Katren. However, with the treaty no longer respected by Abyssinia, it was only a matter of time before Abyssinia would try to reassert their own claim over the settlement. Rather than giving up, the current occupiers of Katren have decided to fight back, and a larger war seems to be breaking out between the two nations."

This allowed easier production and maintentance of equipment as most of its parts were interchangeable with the mainline gunpowder version. The only problem was the lack of domestic crystal supply, making it more expensive as its large-scale production required the import of crystals from abroad."
