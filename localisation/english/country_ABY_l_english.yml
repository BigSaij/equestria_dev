 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid:0 "Gomez Clawomon"
 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid_desc:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon has a heritage of over a thousand years, so expectations have always been high for him, especially as he is the grandson of the famous Queen Mewmew the Second who restored the dynasty to the throne of Abyssinia. He was raised in the royal palace of Panthera and his father King Mawkonnen ensured he was given the best education money could buy, which prepared him for his future as his heir. As a student, he was proficient, even if lacking in passion, and excelled at economics, mathematics and history. Already at a young age he fell in love with his cousin Morticia, but was unable to marry her due to cousin marriage being strongly frowned upon in Abyssinia. When Mawkonnen died in 998 ALB, Gomez was more than ready to succeed him and immediately married Morticia. He was fully aware of the many potential problems that threatened Abyssinia, and planned to deal with them before it was too late.\n\nUnfortunately, black cats aren't known for their luck.\n\nAs soon as news of the Storm King's rapid conquests arrived, Gomez began preparing defences and building up the royal army. But despite his best efforts, he had no counter to his airships and Abyssinia's cities fell one by one. In the end, when Panthera burned, he finally surrendered, offering his crown to the Storm King. But just as quickly as he had arrived, the Storm King left, leaving behind a devastated, impoverished kingdom.\n\nWith his dreams shattered and his kingdom on the brink of collapse, Gomez's mental state worsened rapidly as he was unable to cope with the stress. Time will tell if he is able to recover and face his daunting challenges."

 ABY_wingbardian_concessions:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewmew II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia. This treaty was seen as fair. However, after the Storm King invaded and greatly weakened Abyssinia, Wingbardy forced King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat. While the economy benefits from Wingbardian activity, most of the populace resents the treaty."
 ABY_angry_slaves:0 "Slave Unrest"
 ABY_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewmew II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races. Over the century, hundreds of thousands of slaves have been acquired from abroad, either through trade or force. These slaves are for the most part ponies, donkeys, zebras and horses. Following the Storm King's invasion, many of them rose up against their owners, starting a spiral of deadly violence that could escalate out of control."
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership:0 "Paralyzed Government"
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia has traditionally been an absolute monarchy ruled by decree. However, King Gomez's poor mental state has resulted in the government being left completely idle, unable to do anything without the King's approval or command. Normally this would be enough of a problem, but in times of crisis decisions are urgently needed, yet no one makes them. As a result, Abyssinia is becoming increasingly chaotic and the aristocats are beginning to question Gomez's ability to rule."
 ABY_risk_of_famine:0 "Risk Of Famine"
 ABY_risk_of_famine_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula is a dry region largely unsuited for agriculture, with many cats in the countryside still living as pastoralists. Worse still, arable land in the highlands is used for growing cash crops for export such as coffee. Before the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinia was perfectly capable of buying tonnes of food from abroad and importing it, but with an empty, sacked treasury and ever increasing internal instability, these imports have almost completely ceased. Food stocks are slowly but surely becoming completely empty. If nothing is done, starvation will threaten almost the entire populace."

 abyssinia.1.t:0 "Reliving The Past"
 abyssinia.1.d:0 "Boom. Boom. Smash. The steel battering ram shattered the gates of the royal palace. A grey, ape-like head with a horned crown peeked inside. "Hellooooo? Anybody home?"\n\nIt was the Storm King.\n\nKing Gomez embraced his wife and consort, Queen Morticia as the towering armored yeti walked inside, accompanied by his masked soldiers. "Hope you don't mind me letting myself in. But I practically own the place already, don't I?" he said with a smug yet casual smirk, then bowed mockingly. "Your majesties. King and Queen of Abyssinia. You should surrender. Now."\nThe glow of the burning city of Panthera shone through the gates. Gomez sighed deeply as his courtiers stared at him, then slowly took off his golden crown and offered it to the yeti. "...Storm King. You have conquered this nation. Abyssinia is yours."\nThe Storm King took the crown, then immediately crushed it. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really into the whole 'ruling' thing. You folks can keep Abyssinia."\nGomez blinked in confusion. "W-what?"\n"I know I call myself a 'King', but frankly, monarchy just isn't my thing. You take over one country, next thing you're dealing with taxes and committees and retirement packages!" With his large hands, he molded the crown into a crude ring which he put on one of his three fingers. "No, I don't want Abyssinia - just its riches." He leaned closer to Gomez, who reflexively shielded Morticia from him. "The treasure vaults of Abyssinia are filled with strange and exotic wonders, so they say. Magical artifacts, flawless jewels, golden trinkets. I'd like them all, please."\n"You want - our wealth?" Gomez asked.\n"Running a whole armada is expensive, you know. You wouldn't believe the upkeep on all those airships!"\n"You - you can't!" Morticia shrieked. "Abyssinia is a trade nation. We need our wealth to import crops, feed our citizens, build our homes! Please, you must leave us something!"\nThe Storm King frowned melodramatically. "Oh, I will. After I empty your vaults, I'll leave you alone."\n"Wait! You can't! We'll have nothing left! Why have you destroyed Abyssinia?"\nThe Storm King grinned in a way that Gomez wouldn't forget. "Because it was next on my list.""
 abyssinia.1.a:0 "..."

 abyssinia.2.t:0 "A Typical Awakening"
 abyssinia.2.d:0 "King Gomez snapped awake in his bed before realizing it had just been the same reoccuring dream again. Or nightmare, except it didn't make him feel anything anymore. He groaned and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\n\nIt was four in the afternoon. He had slept for six hours.\n\nSlowly, he pushed himself up, yawned and rubbed his burning eyes. Then he simply sat there, staring into nothingness.\nHis paws began to tremble.\nGlancing at the door which appeared to be locked, he swiftly leaped onto the floor and crawled underneath the bed, digging up his secret stash of catnip. He rubbed and fondled the plant, then chewed on it. The trembling stopped and he purred as his body relaxed.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nGomez immediately pushed himself up, hit his head on the bottom of the bed, and quickly climbed back out. "W-what in the... why didn't you knock?" he mumbled as he drooled from the catnip. His trusted right paw cat, Tsehafe Taezaz, Minister of the Pen, Scribe by Command, Dejen Rees-Moggy, stood in the doorway, completely unfazed.\n"I did, my King, but you didn't seem to hear it. I wanted to ask you if you've finally decided when we can have a meeting."\nGomez swallowed the catnip and straightened himself. "I... haven't. Not today, at least."\n"You can't postpone this forever, your Majesty."\n"I... I know," he replied and sighed.\nDejen rolled his eyes. "Also, I wanted to remind you that your wife has prepared a meal for you. She's been waiting for a while."\nGomez's eyes widened. "Oh, Tartarus! I forgot about it!" He rushed out of the bedroom, running past his advisor, leaving him alone.\nDejen shrugged and headed back to his office."
 abyssinia.2.a:0 "..."
 
 abyssinia.3.t:0 "Late For Dinner"
 abyssinia.3.d:0 "Queen Morticia sat at the large dinner table, refusing to touch her food while she waited for her husband. She knew that he was probably sleeping and regretted not being able to sleep at the same time due to his... changed sleep schedule. At least he usually woke up in time for dinner.\n\nKing Gomez barged into the room. "I-I am so sorry, Tish, I completely forgot about this!"\nMorticia raised an eyebrow. "But we have dinner every day?"\n"Uuuh... yes, but... ah, it doesn't matter." He sat down on the opposite end of the table, his shoulders slumped. "What are we having today."\n"In solidarity with our hungering subjects, we are only having a little bit of kibble. I even arranged for a cat to take a photograph of our meal so it could appear in the newspapers, but... he had to leave after waiting for an hour."\nGomez groaned and rubbed his forehead. "That's my fault, sorry."\nMorticia forced a smile. "It's fine! We can still enjoy the meal."\nThe catnip was making Gomez's mind foggy. "Sorry, but I'm not really hungry."\n"But you haven't eaten since yesterday?"\n"I know..."\n\nThere was an extended moment of silence as Morticia looked at his husband with concern. Things were only getting worse and worse, she thought. "Honey, I know I've asked about this before, but have you considered getting some help? I'm sure there's cats out there who could figure out what's wrong with you."\nGomez stared blankly into his plate of kibble, then replied:"
 abyssinia.3.a:0 ""I'm fine.""
 abyssinia.3.b:0 ""...I do need help.""
 
 abyssinia.4.t:0 "The Gathering Of The Nobles"
 abyssinia.4.d:0 "The decrepit stone mansion of the Catwe dynasty was usually a quiet place, yet now it was filled with hundreds of cats, most of whom were servants. A dozen litters, including elaborate palanquins as well as sedan chairs, were waiting for their owners outside, along with their slave-carriers. A few of the slaves, mostly horses and ponies, were not carriers but steeds and used the opportunity to relax and take off their saddles.\n\nIn the meantime, the nobles had all gathered to a conference room. The owner of the mansion and the host of the meeting, Catrina Catwe, was filing her claws. One of the aristocats coughed. "It is impolite to keep us waiting, Catrina," another noble, Ras Tardar Sourpuss, hissed.\nCatrina admired the sharpness of her claws and smiled. "I am the host of this house, and I decide when the meeting starts. And it starts now." She turned to look at the nobles. At least half of the most important aristocats had gathered here, and all of them supported her claim to the throne in various degrees. "I am glad all of you accepted the invitation, as we need to decide our next course of action. Thankfully, I have the perfect plan to depose our indecisive King, who is clearly unfit to rule."\n"You always promise us the sun and the moon," Tardar replied dryly, "but you are no alicorn."\nNot yet, Catrina thought, and wondered if Tardar really was always this grumpy, or if her face was stuck in a perpetual frown. "Unlike Gomez, I keep my promises, dear Tardar. Now listen, I have much to explain...""
 abyssinia.4.a:0 "..."
 
 abyssinia.5.t:0 "Choosing A Cure"
 abyssinia.5.d:0 "Gomez was slumped in his chair as he listened to his wife explain her plans. While he admired his wife's hopefulness and enthusiasm, he also felt jealous. Why couldn't he feel the same way anymore?\n\n"So I've contacted the best doctors in the Kingdom," Morticia said, "and they said they'd be more than happy to diagnose your condition. Maybe your mood is linked to some sickness? Alternatively, you might just need a break from everything. Rulership can be very stressful, after all. I've asked various cats about where you could go on vacation, and some of them suggested visiting the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela in Jirati. I sent a message to the priests there and they'd be more than happy to welcome you. Lastly, we have plenty of relatives who are concerned about you. We could hold a family gathering and see if they can help you feel any better. How do these options sound, honey? Which one do you think is best?"\n\nGomez blinked slowly. "Uuuuh... they're all fine, I guess."\nMorticia's smile faded slightly. "Well, you have to pick one, as we can't do all of them at once."\nHe rubbed his aching forehead. "Ugh, alright. Let me think...""
 abyssinia.5.a:0 ""...the doctors can probably solve this.""
 abyssinia.5.b:0 ""...I should take a break.""
 abyssinia.5.c:0 ""...when was the last time the Clawomons gathered, anyways?""
 
 abyssinia.6.t:0 "Blackmail Material"
 abyssinia.6.d:0 "Dejen Rees-Moggy walked to his office and opened the door. Light of the rising morning sun shone through the windows inside, behind a figure who was sitting on his chair.\nDejen frowned. "Who are you and who granted you permission to be seated in my workspace?"\nThe stranger chuckled and steepled her paws. "I granted permission to myself. I am the rightful owner of this place, after all."\nHe raised an eyebrow. "...Catrina of House Catwe?"\n"Mhm, you know your history, at least. Let me cut to the chase: I want to acquire information."\nHis eyes narrowed. "Of what kind?"\n"Oh, you see, I have certain plans, and to fulfill them, I need some... incriminating facts about our beloved King and liege. With evidence, preferably."\n"And why would I give you anything?"\n"Tell me, are you pleased with the rule of King Gomez? You can be honest with me."\nDejen hesitated rather than answering.\n"None of us are," Catrina hissed. "And you can help me to replace him with someone better."\n"Yourself?"\nCatrina laughed. "Hah, that is besides the point! Just give me what I want, and I'll take care of the rest."\nDejen took a deep breath. He had a tough decision to make."
 abyssinia.6.a:0 ""I know a thing or two about Gomez...""
 abyssinia.6.b:0 ""There's nothing I can give you.""
 
 abyssinia.7.t:0 "Professional Diagnosis"
 abyssinia.7.d:0 "The finest cat doctors of Abyssinia had gathered in the palace, having been promised plenty of money which they would get once the Kingdom stopped being bankrupt. King Gomez was subjected to several hours of careful analysis, questioning and diagnosis as they checked every part of his body and wanted to hear his entire life story. By the end of it, he was completely exhausted, but at least the medical experts had enough data now to come to some sort of conclusion. They all agreed that he had depression or melancholia. However, they did not agree what the cause was or how he should be treated.\n"He clearly has an imbalance of humours in his body, an excess of black bile!" one doctor said. "Some bloodletting should do the trick."\n"Nonsense, this is clearly a case of demonic possession!"\n"Possession has scientifically been proven to not cause depression! Rather, the demon treats the body like a puppet. Besides, we cats have inherently low magical energies and thus are very unlikely to be possessed."\n"I think a combination of ferrous iodide, arsenic, ergot, strophantin and cinchona should do the trick of curing him."\n"Opium alone should suffice."\n"No! He needs a lobotomy!"\n"What about electroshock therapy?"\n"Untested new technology sounds dangerous."\n"Hmmm... how about this then?" The doctor gave Gomez a large poster. It had a feral cat hanging from a tree branch, accompanied by the text "Hang in there!".\nGomez groaned. Everything they proposed sounded terrible.\n"I'm sorry honey," Morticia said, "but I couldn't convince better doctors from Equestria to come here. How about we try something else?""
 abyssinia.7.a:0 ""Let's have that family gathering.""
 abyssinia.7.b:0 ""I really need a vacation after this.""
 
 abyssinia.8.t:0 "A Rocky Road"
 abyssinia.8.d:0 "King Gomez had known about the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela as they were famous, but he had never realized how remote they were. There was no railroad in the region, so he and his entourage had arrived by boat in Catemte, then taken a winding unpaved road up the mountains. He had been seated in an expensive imported car before it broke down, and then was carried on a palanquin by servants who were quickly exhausted. Unlike the nobles, he did not have sturdy equines as slaves, but rather free cats who were paid a salary. And with an empty treasury, they hadn't been paid enough to carry him all the way up. In the end, the King was walking.\n\nOn the way to the temples they passed by an isolated village. The locals poured out of their houses to see the King with their own eyes. One of them was a young kitten, who was wearing rags and appeared emaciated. He approached Gomez and asked: "You're the King, right? Why do you look so sad?"\nGomez sighed. "I carry the weight of the Kingdom on my shoulders, little one."\n"But you wear such fancy clothes and jewels! And I bet you have lots of food and a HUGE mansion and the BIGGEST ball of yarn in the world!"\n"I... have some of those, I suppose."\n"Then how can you be sad? If I was you, I'd be so happy!"\nThis kitten was still so naïve and simple, Gomez thought. "You already seem happy yourself, despite having nothing."\nThe kitten giggled. "I have lots of fun with my friends!"\nThe King had a faint, wistful smile. He took out a gold coin which he had hidden from the Storm King inside his robes, and gave it to the kitten. "Here, have this. Go buy some food for yourself, it must be expensive these days.""
 abyssinia.8.a:0 ""Oh thank you, King!""
 
 abyssinia.9.t:0 "One Big Happy Family"
 abyssinia.9.d:0 "The large dining table of the royal couple was filled to the brim with food and surrounded by numerous members of the House of Clawomon. At least, the Storm King hadn't emptied the pantry, though Queen Morticia had wished for them to eat less food and instead donate some of it to hungry peasants. Her relatives didn't listen.\n\nThe constant chatter and noise of cats of all ages was deafening, and King Gomez felt like he was going to get a headache. His already minimal appetite had become non-existent.\n"What's wrong Gomy?" his old uncle asked. "Not going to touch your food?"\n"It's probably because he's 'depressed'!" his cousin thrice removed said.\n"Depression isn't real," his niece said. "Snap out of it!"\n"He has it easy!" his nephew hissed. "I lost my home, my leg and my wealth during the Storm King's invasion, but you don't see me frowning!"\n"Yeah, don't be sad, Gomez!" his aunt said. "Just look on the bright side of life and appreciate all the good things in it!"\n"It's all in your head," mother-in-law said. "Why do you let it affect you so much?"\nHis godfather drank some milk and laughed. "He needs to have more fun in life, that's all!"\n\nGomez groaned and visibly shrunk. His wife, who was sitting next to him, noticed this. "This was a mistake," she whispered into his ear. "We should try something else...""
 abyssinia.9.a:0 ""Maybe those doctors can give actually useful advice.""

 abyssinia.10.t:0 "The Council Of Nobility"
 abyssinia.10.d_present_and_no_blackmail:0 "The Abyssinian aristocats had the privilege of convening the council of nobility to discuss important matters related to the Kingdom. As the purpose of the council was to offer counsel to the King, he was required to be present. The council had gathered only a few times after the Storm King's invasion, as the nobles quickly realized the King had little interest in listening to them, and didn't even want to be there. So it was a surprise to Gomez when the council gathered again for the first time in many moons.\n\nReluctantly, he dragged himself to the council chambers even though he would've rather stayed in bed. He saw that all the important nobles in the Kingdom had come, so they probably had something important to say. He sighed and sat down at the end of the table.\n"His Majesty finally bothered to arrive, so let us finally begin," Ras Tardar Sourpuss said. "We have a guest speaker here today, so let's get that out of the way."\nCatrina of House Catwe stood up and smiled. "Thank you, honoured Ras. We have all gathered here today to discuss the Crownless King's current pathetic condition. He is clearly incapable to rule his Kingdom anymore, which begs the question why that disgusting cousin-marrier clings on to the throne. Does he really think we want to see his mopey face every time we want to discuss vital political matters?"\nSome nobles laughed, while those who were loyal to the King frowned. Gomez himself appeared unnerved, but remained silent.\nCatrina continued. "May I remind you that his inbred dynasty seized power from MY family, and then proceeded to trample on your ancient rights and privileges. And for what? Our Kingdom lies in ruins, but the Clawomons clearly do not care!"\nAs more and more nobles laughed and cheered, Gomez had enough. He stood up and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Catrina grinned."

He fondles it and chews on it and drools like some wild animal. Here, look at this!" She raised a bag with the royal seal on it that was full of catnip. It was Gomez's secret stash.\nThe room erupted into laughter and shouting. Gomez's eyes widened in shock. Someone close to him had betrayed him and exposed his addiction. His lips quievered and he stood up. The room went silent. "You know what, you are right about everything. I give up. Good bye."\nWithout another word, he walked out of the room and left the door open. The nobles murmured to each other while Catrina grinned, her fangs exposed."

The date was called "Enkutatash", which meant "Gift of Jewels", in reference to a legend related to the mythical founder of the Kingdom of Abyssinia where she was given precious gems upon her return home. Families first visit the local temples, then share a meal of chicken meat covered in sauce. As the sun begins to set, cats don their finest clothes, gather flowers and offer bouquets to their friends while singing songs. In recent years, foreign influences such as firework displays have also become more common especially in cities.\n\nDespite the hard times, the celebrations were jubilant and cats were happy to take a break from the difficulties of life."

But they were surprised to see the King's right-paw cat, Dejen Rees-Moggy, walk outside. He held a paper and cleared his throat before speaking. The crowd went silent.\n\n"The King has made a very important decision which will now be revealed to the public. He is in no condition to hold a speech so I will do it on his behalf, reading what he has written." He raised the paper and read: ""My beloved subjects,\n\nAfter much deliberation, I have finally made a painful but necessary decision. I declare that I have voluntarily abdicated in favour of my very beloved and dear wife, Queen Morticia. This I do with all my heart.\n\nI want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country which, as King of Abyssinia, I have for nine years tried to serve. But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King. And I want you to know that the decision I have made has been mine and mine alone. This was a thing I had to judge entirely for myself. I have made this, the most serious decision of my life, only upon the single thought of what would, in the end, be best for all.\n\nAnd now, we all have a new Queen. I wish her and you, her people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. Long live the Queen!""\n\nThe crowd remained silent, appearing both shocked and confused. However, one of the cats smirked.\n\nIt was Catrina. Her plan was working out perfectly."

 abyssinia.14.d:0 "The eleven Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela were quite the right to behold. They had been carved directly into the stone centuries ago by King Felibela of the Catwe dynasty who wanted to create a holy city for his Kingdom. The temples and the nearby town had been named after him, but since the Clawomons had deposed his dynasty, the area had been mostly neglected. The town was insignificant and the temples were maintained only by the priests who continued to live in them. However, recently the location had become famous and rejuvenated.\n\nUnlike Felibela, King Gomez was not feeling rejuvenated. Now that he had seen the temples, he wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. It all started feeling like a waste of time, so he sat down on a rock. Nearby, an old statue of Baast stood, the four-legged creator goddess of catkind. He looked at it and wondered if she had made a mistake granting sapience to his ancestors. Maybe he'd be happier if he was a feral cat, chasing mice and what not?\n\n"And who are you?"\nGomez turned his head and saw an old grey cat adorned in pure white robes. "You don't recognize me?" he replied. "I'm the King of Abyssinia... unfortunately."\n"I did not ask for your title. Titles are imaginary and meaningless."\nHe frowned. "My name is Gomez."\n"Names are also imaginary and meaningless. Who really are you?"\nGomez blinked in confusion.\n"You clearly need help with answering that question, if you want to survive your depression. Get up, we have much to talk about."\nGomez hesitated taking orders from this peasant priest, but obeyed nevertheless."

 abyssinia.15.d:0 "Dejen Rees-Moggy handled his daily paperwork with signature efficiency, shuffling papers around on his workdesk and scanning them rapidly with his keen eyes. Yet one paper stopped his swift movements altogether. He took a closer look at a report in his paws, as he had to make sure he had read it correctly.\n\nWhat were these supply requisitions in the capital? They weren't for the Crown Guard or the local garrison, those were in a separate report. Who had even approved these?\n\nHe sprang back to life, digging hastily through his carefully stacked piles of paper. There was a report of the arrival of the retinue of Ras Tardar a week ago. But where was the report of their departure? Had the supplies been requisitioned for them? Then he found several other reports of nobles brining their armed retinues as "bodyguards" for the council they had recently held. Those bodyguards still hadn't left, and their numbers were strangely high. What were they waiting for?\n\nHis eyes widened as he realized their purpose. He stood up from his chair and ran to the imported telephone hanging from the wall. But right as he was call the head of the Crown Guard, the Dejazmach, he hesitated. If he did nothing and acted like he knew nothing, the events would proceed normally. He'd simply have to adapt to the new situation as always. But would that not be treason?"
 abyssinia.15.a:0 ""Hello, Dejazmach? There is a coup about to happen.""
 abyssinia.15.b:0 ""I didn't like working for the Clawomons, anyways.""
