 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid:0 "Gomez Clawomon"
 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid_desc:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon has a heritage of over a thousand years, so expectations have always been high for him, especially as he is the grandson of the famous Queen Mewmew the Second who restored the dynasty to the throne of Abyssinia. He was raised in the royal palace of Panthera and his father King Mawkonnen ensured he was given the best education money could buy, which prepared him for his future as his heir. As a student, he was proficient, even if lacking in passion, and excelled at economics, mathematics and history. Already at a young age he fell in love with his cousin Morticia, but was unable to marry her for a long time due to cousin marriage being strongly frowned upon. When Mawkonnen died in 998 ALB, Gomez was more than ready to succeed him and, with his royal authority, was able to immediately marry Morticia. He was fully aware of the many potential problems that threatened Abyssinia, and planned to deal with them before it was too late.\n\nUnfortunately, black cats aren't known for their luck.\n\nAs soon as news of the Storm King's rapid conquests arrived, Gomez began preparing defences and building up the royal army. But despite his best efforts, he had no counter to his airships and Abyssinia's cities fell one by one. In the end, when Panthera burned and he had lost a part of his right ear, he finally surrendered, offering his crown to the Storm King. But just as quickly as he had arrived, the Storm King left, leaving behind a devastated, impoverished kingdom.\n\nWith his dreams shattered and his kingdom on the brink of collapse, Gomez's mental state worsened rapidly as he was unable to cope with the stress. Time will tell if he is able to recover and face his daunting challenges."

 ABY_catrina_catwe:0 "Catrina Catwe"
 ABY_catrina_catwe_desc:0 "Catrina is a direct descendant of the Catwe kings and queens who once ruled Abyssinia for two hundred years. While this makes her technically a noble, she has no special legal privileges or formal status as the Clawomons stripped her family of any such things. Nevertheless, she is far more wealthy and influential than any mere common cat. While her relatives were kept in check by a strong central government, Catrina was able to use the recent chaos as a ladder to climb up in Abyssinian society. With many blaming the Clawomons for the numerous problems that plagued the Kingdom, she proposed herself as a tempting alternative. The nobles were especially dissatisfied with the Clawomons due to their modernizing reforms, and many of them quickly rallied behind Catrina, as out of all pretenders to the throne, she has by far the strongest claim to the throne.\n\nBut Catrina has no intention of being a mere lackey of the nobles. The invasion of the Storm King opened up her eyes to a simple truth of life: it is better to be among the mighty than caged at someone's command. Abyssinia had long been dominated by foreign powers and other races, but she had ambitious plans that would change everything. Underneath her family mansion, she conducts secret experiments that may well change the fate of catkind forever..."
 ABY_catra_meowmeow:0 "Catra Meowmeow"
 ABY_queen_morticia:0 "Morticia Clawomon"
 ABY_queen_morticia_desc:0 "Being born as a daughter of King Mawkonnen's sister meant that Morticia was privileged from the start. Yet unlike some of her relatives, she never let it inflate her ego. A kittenhood friendship with a servant ensured she'd feel empathy for those who were deemed "commoners" in Abyssinian society. After her mother's death, she used her inherited wealth for philanthropy and buying freedom for slaves owned by the Kingdom's nobility. While most of her family didn't necessarily agree with her, her cousin Gomez noticed this and admired her generosity and kindness. As the two lived under the same roof, they had long been familiar with each other. However, it came as a shock to their relatives when they announced that they were lovers. Gomez's father King Mawkonnen disapproved of the relationship and forbade their marriage. The two had to wait until his death to finally hold a private wedding ceremony by themselves. Thus, Morticia became Queen consort of Abyssinia.\n\nDespite the controversy with her husband and the fact that the nobility look down upon her, Morticia is very popular among the common cats. This is because she genuinely cares for their well-being and acts as the public face of the monarchy, while Gomez is more withdrawn. Nevertheless, some radicals still believe she is just acting or pretending and that she only gave out wealth to increase her own popularity and influence."

 ### National Spirits ###
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewmew II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia. This treaty was seen as fair. However, after the Storm King invaded and greatly weakened Abyssinia, Wingbardy forced King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat. While the economy benefits from Wingbardian activity, most of the populace resents the treaty."
 ABY_angry_slaves:0 "Slave Unrest"
 ABY_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewmew II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races. Over the century, hundreds of thousands of slaves have been acquired from abroad, either through trade or force. These slaves are for the most part ponies, donkeys, zebras and horses. Following the Storm King's invasion, many of them rose up against their owners, starting a spiral of deadly violence that could escalate out of control."
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership:0 "Paralyzed Government"
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia has traditionally been an absolute monarchy ruled by decree. However, King Gomez's poor mental state has resulted in the government being left completely idle, unable to do anything without the King's approval or command. Normally this would be enough of a problem, but in times of crisis decisions are urgently needed, yet no one makes them. As a result, Abyssinia is becoming increasingly chaotic and the aristocats are beginning to question Gomez's ability to rule."
 ABY_risk_of_famine:0 "Risk Of Famine"
 ABY_risk_of_famine_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula is a dry region largely unsuited for agriculture, with many cats in the countryside still living as pastoralists. Worse still, arable land in the highlands is used for growing cash crops for export such as coffee. Before the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinia was perfectly capable of buying tonnes of food from abroad and importing it, but with an empty, sacked treasury and ever increasing internal instability, these imports have almost completely ceased. Food stocks are slowly but surely becoming completely empty. If nothing is done, starvation will threaten almost the entire populace."
 
 ABY_clawomonid_resistance:0 "Clawomonic Resistance"
 ABY_clawomonid_resistance_desc:0 "Some aristocats remain loyal to the House of Claowmon. They are rallying other cats to their cause, refusing to cooperate with the government and are doing their best to undermine the rule of [Root.GetLeader]. These dissidents have to be dealt with, or they might even attempt another Clawomonic Restoration..."

 ABY_weak_clawomonid_resistance_desc:0 "A few aristocats remain loyal to the House of Claowmon, despite everything.

These dissidents have to be dealt with, or they might even attempt another Clawomonic Restoration..."
 
 ABY_centralized_banking:0 "The State Bank Of Abyssinia"
 ABY_centralized_banking_desc:0 "Established by King Gomez in [?ABY_bank_year], the State Bank of Abyssinia is entirely owned by the royal government. It carries out dual activities of central and commercial banking. Like its predecessor, it has branches in all notable cities of Abyssinia."
 ABY_pegged_to_bit:0 "Pegged To The Bit"
 ABY_pegged_to_bit_desc:0 "The Abyssinian currency, the purr, has been moved away from the gold standard and now has a fixed exchange rate to the Equestrian bit."
 ABY_pegged_to_idol:0 "Pegged To The Idol"

 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia:0 "Replace The Bank Of Abyssinia"
 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia_desc:0 "During his reign, King Mawkonnen had founded the Bank of Abyssinia, a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank. With the recent economic instability, I advise that this near-bankrupt bank is liquidated and replaced with a fully state-owned bank that will give us greater control of the economy."
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard:0 "Abandon The Gold Standard"
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "For about a century now, the Abyssinian purr has been a gold standard currency, backed by the royal treasury of the monarchy. Unfortunately, the Storm King's recent unauthorized permanent loan has caused rapid deflation due to lack of gold. I've been saying this for a while now, but it is finally time to move away from the gold standard."

 ### Events ###
 
 abyssinia.1.t:0 "Reliving The Past"
 abyssinia.1.d:0 "Boom. Boom. Smash. The steel battering ram shattered the gates of the royal palace. A grey, ape-like head with a horned crown peeked inside. "Hellooooo? Anybody home?"\n\nIt was the Storm King.\n\nKing Gomez embraced his wife and consort, Queen Morticia, as the towering armored yeti walked inside accompanied by his masked soldiers. "Hope you don't mind me letting myself in. But I practically own the place already, don't I?" he said with a smug yet casual smirk, then bowed mockingly. "Your majesties. King and Queen of Abyssinia. You should surrender. Now."\nThe glow of the burning city of Panthera shone through the gates. Gomez sighed deeply as his courtiers stared at him, then slowly took off his golden crown and offered it to the yeti. "...Storm King. You have conquered this nation. Abyssinia is yours."\nThe Storm King took the crown, then immediately crushed it. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really into the whole 'ruling' thing. You folks can keep Abyssinia."\nGomez blinked in confusion. "W-what?"\n"I know I call myself a 'King', but frankly, monarchy just isn't my thing. You take over one country, next thing you're dealing with taxes and committees and retirement packages!" With his large hands, he molded the crown into a crude ring which he put on one of his three large fingers. "No, I don't want Abyssinia - just its riches." He leaned closer to Gomez, who reflexively shielded Morticia from him. "The treasure vaults of Abyssinia are filled with strange and exotic wonders, so they say. Magical artifacts, flawless jewels, golden trinkets. I'd like them all, please."\n"You want - our wealth?" Gomez asked.\n"Running a whole armada is expensive, you know. You wouldn't believe the upkeep on all those airships!"\n"You - you can't!" Morticia shrieked. "Abyssinia is a trade nation. We need our wealth to import crops, feed our citizens, build our homes! Please, you must leave us something!"\nThe Storm King frowned melodramatically. "Oh, I will. After I empty your vaults, I'll leave you alone."\n"Wait! You can't! We'll have nothing left! Why have you destroyed Abyssinia?"\nThe Storm King grinned in a way that Gomez wouldn't forget. "Because it was next on my list.""
 abyssinia.1.a:0 "..."

 abyssinia.2.t:0 "A Typical Awakening"
 abyssinia.2.d:0 "King Gomez snapped awake in his bed before realizing it had just been the same reoccuring dream again. Or nightmare, except it didn't make him feel anything anymore. He groaned and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\n\nIt was four in the afternoon. He had slept for six hours.\n\nSlowly, he pushed himself up, yawned and rubbed his burning eyes. Then he simply sat there, staring into nothingness.\n\nAfter glancing at the door which appeared to be locked, he lowered himself onto the floor and crawled underneath the bed, digging up his secret stash of fresh khat leaves. He put a pawful in his mouth, then chewed on it. He purred as his pupils dilated and he felt alive again.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nGomez immediately pushed himself up, hit his head on the bottom of the bed, and quickly climbed back out. "W-what in the... why didn't you knock?" he mumbled with khat in his mouth. His trusted right paw cat, Tsehafe Taezaz, Minister of the Pen, Scribe by Command, Dejen Rees-Moggy, stood in the doorway, completely unfazed.\n"I did, my King, but you didn't seem to hear it. I wanted to ask you if you've finally decided when we can have a meeting."\nGomez spat out the khat and straightened himself. "I... haven't. Not today, at least."\n"You can't postpone this forever, your Majesty."\n"I... I know," he replied and sighed.\nDejen rolled his eyes. "Also, I wanted to remind you that your wife has prepared a meal for you. She's been waiting for a while."\nGomez's eyes widened. "Oh, Tartarus! I forgot about it!" He rushed out of the bedroom, running past his advisor, leaving him alone.\nDejen shrugged and headed back to his office."
 abyssinia.2.a:0 "..."
 
 abyssinia.3.t:0 "Late For Dinner"
 abyssinia.3.d:0 "Queen Morticia sat at the large dinner table, refusing to touch her food while she waited for her husband. She knew that he was probably sleeping and regretted not being able to sleep at the same time due to his... changed sleep schedule. At least he usually woke up in time for dinner.\n\nKing Gomez barged into the room. "I-I am so sorry, Tish, I completely forgot about this!"\nMorticia raised an eyebrow. "But we have dinner every day?"\n"Uuuh... yes, but... ah, it doesn't matter." He sat down on the opposite end of the table, his shoulders slumped. "What are we having today."\n"In solidarity with our hungering subjects, we are only having a little bit of kibble. I even arranged for a cat to take a photograph of our meal so it could appear in the newspapers, but... he had to leave after waiting for an hour."\nGomez groaned and rubbed his forehead. "That's my fault, sorry."\nMorticia forced a smile. "It's fine! We can still enjoy the meal."\nThe khat was making Gomez's mind foggy. "Sorry, but I'm not really hungry."\n"But you haven't eaten since yesterday?"\n"I know..."\n\nThere was an extended moment of silence as Morticia looked at his husband with concern. Things were only getting worse and worse, she thought. "Honey, you need help. You are sick."\n"Am I? Or do I just see things more clearly than others?" he muttered.\nMorticia sighed. "I understand you better than anyone else, and I can tell something is wrong. And I just want you to be happy again."\nGomez stared blankly into his plate of kibble, then replied:"

 abyssinia.4.t:0 "The Gathering Of The Nobles"
 abyssinia.4.d:0 "The decrepit stone mansion of the Catwe dynasty was usually a quiet place, yet now it was filled with hundreds of cats, most of whom were servants. A dozen litters, including elaborate palanquins as well as sedan chairs, were waiting for their owners outside along with their slave-carriers. A few of the slaves, who were horses and ponies, were not carriers but steeds and used the opportunity to relax and take off their saddles.\n\nIn the meantime, the nobles had all gathered in a conference room. The owner of the mansion and the host of the meeting, Catrina of House Catwe, was filing her claws. One of the aristocats coughed. "It is impolite to keep us waiting, Catrina," Ras Tardar Sourpuss, muttered.\nCatrina admired the sharpness of her claws and smiled. "I am the host of this house, and I decide when the meeting starts. And it starts now." She turned to look at the nobles. At least half of the most important aristocats in the Kingdom had gathered here, and all of them supported her claim to the throne. "I am glad all of you accepted my invitation, as we need to decide our next course of action. Thankfully, I have the perfect plan to depose our indecisive King, who is clearly unfit to rule."\n"You always promise us the sun and the moon," Tardar replied dryly, "but you are no alicorn."\nNot yet, Catrina thought, and wondered if Tardar really was always this grumpy, or if her face was stuck in a perpetual frown. "Unlike Gomez, I keep my promises, dear Tardar. Now listen, I have much to explain...""

 abyssinia.5.t:0 "Choosing A Cure"
 abyssinia.5.d:0 "Gomez was slumped in his chair as he listened to his wife explain her plans. While he admired her hopefulness and enthusiasm, he also felt jealous. Why couldn't he feel the same way anymore?\n\n"So I've contacted the best doctors in the Kingdom," Morticia said, "and they said they'd be more than happy to diagnose your condition. Maybe your mood is linked to some sickness? Alternatively, you might just need a break from everything. Rulership can be very stressful, after all. I've asked various cats about where you could go on vacation, and one of them suggested visiting the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela in Jirati. I sent a message to the priests there and they'd be more than happy to welcome you. If you leave, I could stay here and act as regent. Lastly, we have plenty of relatives who are concerned about you. We could hold a family gathering and see if they can help you feel any better. How do these options sound, honey? Which one do you think is best?"\n\nGomez blinked slowly. "Uuuuh... they're all fine, I guess."\nMorticia's smile faded slightly. "Well, you have to pick one, as we can't do all of them at once."\nHe rubbed his aching forehead. "Ugh, alright. Let me think...""

 abyssinia.6.t:0 "Blackmail Material"
 abyssinia.6.d:0 "Dejen walked to his office and opened the door. Light of the rising morning sun shone through the windows inside, behind a figure who was sitting on his chair.\nDejen frowned. "Who are you and who granted you permission to be seated in my workspace?"\nThe stranger chuckled and steepled her paws. "I granted permission to myself. I am the rightful owner of this place, after all."\nHe raised an eyebrow. "...Catrina of House Catwe?"\n"Mhm, you know your history, at least. Let me cut to the chase: I want to acquire information."\nHis eyes narrowed. "Of what kind?"\n"Oh, you see, I have certain plans, and to fulfill them, I need some... incriminating facts about our beloved King and liege. With evidence, preferably."\n"And why would I give you anything?"\n"Tell me, are you pleased with the rule of King Gomez? You can be honest with me."\nDejen hesitated rather than answering.\n"None of us are," Catrina hissed. "And you can help me to replace him with someone better."\n"Yourself?"\nCatrina laughed. "Hah, that is besides the point! Just give me what I want, and I'll take care of the rest."\nDejen took a deep breath. He had a tough decision to make."

King Gomez was subjected to several hours of careful analysis, questioning and diagnosis as they checked every part of his body and wanted to hear his entire life story. By the end of it, he was completely exhausted, but at least the medical experts had enough data now to come to some sort of conclusion. They all agreed that he had depression or melancholia. However, they did not agree what the cause was or how he should be treated.\n"He clearly has an imbalance of humours in his body, an excess of black bile!" one doctor said. "Some bloodletting should do the trick."\n"Nonsense, this is clearly a case of demonic possession!"\n"Possession has scientifically been proven to not cause depression! Rather, the demon treats the body like a puppet. Besides, we cats have inherently low magical energies and thus are very unlikely to be possessed."\n"I think a combination of ferrous iodide, arsenic, ergot, strophantin and cinchona should do the trick of curing him."\n"Opium alone should suffice."\n"No! He needs a lobotomy!"\n"What about electroshock therapy?"\n"Untested new technology sounds dangerous."\n"Hmmm... how about this then?" The doctor gave Gomez a large poster. It had a feral cat hanging from a tree branch, accompanied by the text "Hang in there!".\nGomez groaned. Everything they proposed sounded terrible.\n"I'm sorry honey," Morticia said, "but we couldn't afford to get better doctors from Equestria to come here. How about we try something else?""

 abyssinia.8.d:0 "King Gomez had known about the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela as they were famous, but he had never realized how remote they were. There was no railroad in the region, so he and his entourage had arrived by boat in Catemte, then taken a winding unpaved road up the mountains. He had been seated in an expensive imported car before it broke down, and then was carried on a palanquin by servants who were quickly exhausted. Unlike the nobles, he did not have sturdy equines as slaves, but rather free cats who were paid a salary. And with an empty treasury, they hadn't been paid enough to carry him all the way up. In the end, the King was walking.\n\nOn the way to the temples they passed by an isolated village. The locals poured out of their houses to see the King with their own eyes. One of them was a young kitten, who was wearing rags and appeared emaciated. He approached Gomez and asked: "You're the King, right? Why do you look so sad?"\nGomez sighed. "I carry the weight of the Kingdom on my shoulders, little one."\n"But you wear such fancy clothes and jewels! And I bet you have lots of food and a HUGE mansion and the BIGGEST ball of yarn in the world!"\n"I... have some of those, I suppose."\n"Then how can you be sad? If I was you, I'd be so happy!"\nThis kitten was still so naïve and simple, Gomez thought. "You already seem happy yourself, despite having nothing."\nThe kitten giggled. "I have lots of fun with my friends!"\nThe King had a faint, wistful smile. He took out a gold coin which he had hidden from the Storm King inside his robes, and gave it to the kitten.

Her relatives didn't listen.\n\nThe constant chatter and noise of cats of all ages was deafening, and King Gomez felt like he was going to get a headache. His already minimal appetite had become non-existent.\n"What's wrong Gomy?" his old uncle asked. "Not going to touch your food?"\n"It's probably because he's 'depressed'!" his cousin thrice removed said.\n"Depression isn't real," his sister-in-law said. "Snap out of it!"\n"He has it easy!" his brother-in-law hissed. "I lost my home, my leg and my wealth during the Storm King's invasion, but you don't see me frowning!"\n"Yeah, don't be sad, Gomez!" his aunt said. "Just look on the bright side of life and appreciate all the good things in it!"\n"It's all in your head," mother-in-law said.

As the purpose of the council was to offer counsel to the King, he was required to be present. The council had gathered only a few times after the Storm King's invasion, as the nobles quickly realized the King had little interest in listening to them, and didn't even want to be there. So it was a surprise to Gomez when the council gathered again for the first time in many moons.\n\nReluctantly, he dragged himself to the council chambers even though he would've rather stayed in bed. He saw that all the important nobles in the Kingdom had come, so they probably had something important to say. He sighed and sat down at the end of the table.\n"His Majesty finally bothered to arrive, so let us begin," Ras Tardar Sourpuss said. "We have a guest speaker here today, so let's get that out of the way."\nCatrina of House Catwe stood up and smiled. "Thank you, honoured Ras. We have all gathered here today to discuss the Crownless King's current pathetic condition. He is clearly incapable to rule his Kingdom anymore, which begs the question: why does that disgusting cousin-marrier cling on to the throne? Does he really think we want to see his mopey face every time we discuss vital political matters?"\nSome nobles laughed, while those who were loyal to the King frowned. Gomez himself appeared unnerved, but remained silent.\nCatrina continued. "May I remind you that his inbred dynasty seized power from MY family, and then proceeded to trample on your ancient rights and privileges. And for what? Our Kingdom lies in ruins, but the Clawomons clearly do not care!"\nAs more and more nobles laughed and cheered, Gomez had enough.

We have all gathered here today to discuss the Crownless King's current pathetic condition. He is clearly incapable to rule his Kingdom anymore, which begs the question: why does that disgusting cousin-marrier cling on to the throne? Does he really think we want to see his mopey face every time we discuss vital political matters?"\nSome nobles laughed, while those who were loyal to the King frowned. Gomez himself appeared unnerved, but remained silent.\nCatrina continued. "I have also heard that he has a crippling khat addiction. He can't get enough of the stuff! Rather than facing the problems of his Kingdom, he keeps chewing on the stuff to get high as a kite. Here, look at this!" She raised a bag with the royal seal on it that was full of khat leaves. It was Gomez's hidden stash.\nThe room erupted into laughter and shouting. Gomez's eyes widened in shock. Someone close to him had betrayed him and exposed his secret. His lips quievered and he stood up. The room went silent. "You know what, you are right about everything. I give up.

He is in no condition to hold a speech so I will do it on his behalf, reading what he has written." He raised the paper and read:\n\n""My beloved subjects,\n\nAfter much deliberation, I have finally made a painful but necessary decision. I declare that I have voluntarily abdicated in favour of my very beloved and dear wife, Queen Morticia. This I do with all my heart.\n\nI want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country which, as King of Abyssinia, I have for nine years tried to serve.

I have made this, the most serious decision of my life, only upon the single thought of what would, in the end, be best for all.\n\nAnd now, we all have a new Queen.

The temples and the nearby town had been named after him, but since the Clawomons had deposed his dynasty, the area had been mostly neglected. The town was insignificant and the temples were maintained only by the priests who continued to live in them. However, recently the location had become famous and rejuvenated.\n\nUnlike Felibela, King Gomez was not feeling rejuvenated. Now that he had seen the temples, he wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. It all started feeling like a waste of time, so he sat down on a rock. Nearby, an old statue of Baast stood, the four-legged creator goddess of catkind. He looked at it and wondered if she had made a mistake granting sapience to his ancestors. Maybe he'd be happier if he was a feral cat, chasing mice and what not?\n\n"And who are you?"\nGomez turned his head and saw an old grey cat adorned in pure white robes. "You don't recognize me?" he replied. "I'm the King of Abyssinia... unfortunately."\n"I did not ask for your title. Titles are imaginary and meaningless."\nThe King frowned. "My name is Gomez Mawkonnen."\n"Names are also imaginary and meaningless. Who really are you?"\nGomez blinked in confusion.\n"You clearly need help with answering that question.

Who had even approved these?\n\nHe sprang back to life, digging hastily through his carefully stacked piles of paper. There was a report of the arrival of the retinue of Ras Tardar a week ago. But where was the report of their departure? Had the supplies been requisitioned for them? Then he found several other reports of nobles brining their armed retinues as "bodyguards" for the council they had recently held. Those bodyguards still hadn't left, and their numbers were strangely high. What were they waiting for?\n\nHis eyes widened as he realized their purpose. He stood up from his chair and ran to the imported telephone hanging from the wall. But right as he was about to call the head of the Crown Guard, the Dejazmach, he hesitated.

I am the Queen!"\n"Calm down, sweetheart," Catrina purred. "While Gomez designated you as his successor, your claim to the throne is very weak as you are his cousin. The nobles have decided to hold an emergency meeting to elect a better candidate for the throne."\n"And who would that be?" Morticia asked, knowing the answer already.\n"Me, of course!" Catrina said and laughed. "I am a direct descendant of King Felibela. And the nobles are quite sick of Clawomon rule. Besides, your ancestor deposed my family in quite the illegal fashion."\n"The Catwes were the ones who seized the Kingdom without any right to do so!"\n"Tsk tsk, how about we leave history to the chroniclers. What matters is the present moment. Let us proceed with the vote! Every noble who wishes for me to succeed Gomez to the throne, raise your paw."\nMajority of the nobles did so. A few did not, and they looked at Morticia apologetically, powerless to do anything.\n"Then it is decided!" Catrina said and clasped her paws. "Unless you'd like to contest my claim to the throne, Morticia. In which case I'm sure my supporters would imprison you immediately, right here and now."\nMorticia sighed.

Is it from my wi- the Queen?"\nThe messenger gave the message to him, so Gomez started reading.\n\n"THE ROYAL PALACE\nPANTHERA\n\nCATWE SUPPORTERS STORMED THE PALACE -(STOP)-\nCROWN GUARD SURRENDERED AFTER A BATTLE -(STOP)-\nCATRINA PROCLAIMED HERSELF QUEEN -(STOP)-\nIMPRISONED QUEEN MORTICIA -(STOP)-\nKING GOMEZ MUST GO INTO HIDING AND AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS -(STOP)-\n\nDEJAZMACH MEOW FROWN"\n\nGomez stared at it in shock. He should've known this would've happened. Leaving the capital had been a mistake.\n"Sir? Is everything alright?"\n"I need to save my wife," he muttered, crumpling the paper in his black paws. "And take back my throne." His fears had been realized, so his anxiety was replaced with furious determination. He didn't care about becoming a king again, but he had to rescue Morticia. And he was ready to die trying."
 abyssinia.23.d_thatwasclose:0 "While staying at Felibela, the King resided in a small house that they had rented from a local storeowner. He spent most of his days indoors lying on his bed, trying to "relax" and "enjoy" his "vacation".

 abyssinia.24.t:0 "Psychoanalysis"
 abyssinia.24.d:0 "Just as the priest had told him, Gomez tried to live like a regular cat for a while and not think about his duties. This was difficult as he still spent most of his time inside his bedroom and all the other cats continued to treat him like a King. So when Tekle invited him again, he was unsure if his advice had been of any use.\n\nWhen Gomez arrived, Tekle was already seated, so he lied down on the bed.\n"Good to see you, Gomez," the priest said. "How have you been?"\n"I... fine, I suppose."\n"Did anything change after you stopped thinking about Kingship?"\n"Well..." he frowned and pondered, examining his own emotions. "I do feel a little... less stressed."\n"Good. So your mood is linked to your responsibility. You worry about the troubles you face. But also... I feel like you blame yourself, for what happened."\n"What do you mean?"\n"You tried to defend the Kingdom but failed. I know that much. But no one could've defeated the Storm King except for the Hippogriffs. This feeling is not rational either. And I believe that the root causes of your anguish are ultimately doubt and hatred of the self."\nGomez stared at him and said nothing.\n"Am I right? The mind is a difficult thing to decipher."\nThe King let out a long, drawn out sigh. "Yes."\nTekle smiled. "Excellent. Now the treatment can begin. Emotions are like fire: they are good servants but bad masters. You must dethrone your feelings and become once more your own master, the King of your mind's Kingdom.""

 abyssinia.25.t:0 "Going On A Walk"
 abyssinia.25.d:0 "The priest led Gomez outside, and as they walked, the King asked: "Why did it take so long for you to understand the problem?"\n"Every case of unhappiness is different, and I have seen too many over the years. I've learned not to make swift judgements. Besides, you're here on vacation, no? It was good for your mind to take it easy for a while."\n"...Right," Gomez replied. "Where are we going, anyways?"\n"Nowhere. Walking helps to stimulate your body and thus your mind. One treatment is exercise."\n"Ah... well, I'm not really feeling better yet."\n"Does a seed sprout into a tree in a day? No, and you have to water it often and take good care of it."\n"I see."\n"But while we're walking, we might as well be talking! The problems of your mind are two-pronged. Self-doubt comes from being too worried about being good enough for others, when you should focus on being good enough for yourself. Self-hatred comes from preferring to blame yourself rather than others, and not letting go of the past. Yet the past is never coming back, so the best you can do is make the present better and create new memories."\nGomez nodded slowly and didn't say anything for a while. Then he asked: "You're a priest. I thought you would've only been good at reciting the Three Scriptures and nothing more."\n"Our duty is to be the spiritual pillar of society. Baast gifted us sapient minds, but they are fragile. Cats like me tend to these minds and treat them when they are sick." The old cat sighed. "But I know that the world is changing. Equestrian science, with its 'psychology' and neuromantic spells, is the future." He turned to look at Gomez and smiled. "My final task is to help you, Gomez. It shall be a fitting finale for my long life.""

 abyssinia.26.t:0 "Sitting On A Rock"
 abyssinia.26.d:0 "After a while of walking (and talking), the two cats arrived at a large rock that rested on the edge of a cliff. The priest seemed to get an idea and climbed on top of it, even if it looked like the rock could tip over the edge.\n"W-where are you going?" Gomez asked.\nThe priest sat down on the rock and crossed his legs. "Come, sit down next to me. The view from here is wonderful!"\nGomez hesitated.\nTekle turned around and looked at him. "What, are you afraid of falling and dying?"\nGomez didn't answer.\n"We have nine lives, just like feral cats. Nine chances... but it is entirely possible this is my last life. Yet does this mean I should live in fear?"\n"I'm not afraid," Gomez said. "Sometimes... I think about jumping off a cliff. But I just... want to decide when it happens."\n"So you are afraid, then. Come, there's nothing to fear. This rock has been here for thousands of years."\nGomez gulped and climbed, sitting down next to Tekle.\n\n"There we go. Now, this is a great place to focus. Sit like I do, take this stance. Like that, yes. Then breathe, control it. Slow and steady. Feel your breaths, feel the air in your lungs. Next you can extend your awareness further. How does the rest of your body feel? How does your mind feel? Register emotions within you. You cannot grasp fog, you must hold solid things. As such your thoughts and feelings must become controllable. Think of something that makes you unhappy or distressed. The burning city of Panthera, for example. Then think of what makes you happy, or what made you happy before. Like your wife. What emotions do they cause, if any? Face them. Permit them to pass over you and through you. Your feelings don't define who you are. You define yourself. Let the negative compounding thoughts go on. Don't judge yourself if you can't succeed at first. Don't judge yourself at all. Every sapient creature is flawed. Only Baast was perfect, and she is dead."\n\nGomez quietly stared into the distance."

 abyssinia.27.t:0 "Coffee Time The Sequel"
 abyssinia.27.d:0 "Gomez sipped from his hot cup of coffee. Like Tekle had taught him, he tried to focus on the flavour and the heat radiating from the liquid. He had to admit it was pleasant. Nevertheless, he still didn't feel happy, an he doubted if he was ever going to be. But he didn't feel too unhappy either. He had always wanted to learn how to control his emotions. Maybe this was the way.\n\n"We have made good progress", the priest, who sat on the opposite end of the table, said. "But I doubt it is anywhere near enough."\n"I'm afraid I'll have to leave. I've spent too long here already."\n"What, you don't want to procrastinate on your duties anymore? I don't believe you."\nThe King sighed. "I just want to see my Queen again."\n"I know that. Even though you are learning to manage your feelings, you must still learn to face your problems. If you don't, they will only get worse and worse. The only way to break the cycle is to deal with them."\nGomez drank more coffee.\n"We all have to do things we don't want to do. This is as true for a King as it is true for a slave. But they have to be done. Yet do not let your duty overcome you. When work is over, you are just a cat like me. Remember that."\n"But my resposibility is far greater than anycat else's." He thought of the famished kitten at that village and felt guilty about it.\n"You are right. But the responsibility isn't exclusively yours. Learn to share it with others, to ease the burden."\nGomez nodded and finished his coffee. "...I think what has helped me most is having someone who can actually understand me. My wife... tries her best, but she just can't help me."\n"You're welcome. And I shall await your return, friend."\n\nGomez smiled faintly."

 abyssinia.28.t:0 "The Return Of The King"
 abyssinia.28.d:0 "The imported car drove into the courtyard of the royal palace and stopped. Dozens of servants immediately swarmed around it, and Queen Morticia stood at the entrance of the palace, flanked by several crown guard. When she saw Gomez step outside, she rushed to embrace him. "Welcome home, honey," she said.\nGomez hugged her back. "You know, the vacation was a good idea. I feel... refreshed."\nMorticia's eyes widened. "Really?"\nHe nodded and forced a smile.\n\nHis right-paw cat, Dejen, had also come outside to meet him.\n"Good to see you Dejen," Gomez said to him. "Do you have time for a meeting tomorrow?"\nThe bureaucat subtly raised an eyebrow. "No, but the day after that has a free spot."\n"Good. I'd like to try having one, it's been too long since the last time."\n"Glad to have you back, your Majesty," Dejen replied and bowed respectfully.\n"And I'm glad to be back," Gomez said and kissed his wife on the cheek.\n\nOf course, not much had changed. But even if he had little hope, he wanted to give hope to others. That was the least he could do, even as he couldn't stop thinking about his hidden stash of khat leaves."
 abyssinia.28.a:0 "The battle has only begun."

 abyssinia.29.t:0 "A Comprehensive Overview"
 abyssinia.29.d:0 ""I will be honest, your Majesty, I wasn't certain if you'd be here," Dejen said as he was preparing his presentation.\n"It's fine. I wasn't sure either," Gomez replied.\n"Well, because this has taken long enough to happen, I will get straight to the point. My overview will cover the internal and external situation of the Kingdom. I will start with the former." He had placed a large map of Abyssinia behind him and had a pointing stick in his paw. "When I wrote this presentation, my largest concern was the nobility, but since then their threat has diminished. Nevertheless, many nobles remain dissatisfied with your rule for understandable reasons. They will need to be reminded of your legitimacy and competence. The second internal issue is slavery. There is every reason to outlaw it fully and emancipate our million slaves, but the aforementioned nobles strongly oppose this. Yet not doing so will lead to constant slave revolts that are costly to pacify." He pointed at Coltuba with his stick. "The third issue is Manedalusia. Tensions remain over the conflict we had with Maregypt years ago, and the local secessionist movement has utilized recent chaos to grow in strength. The fourth issue is famine. Without funds to import food, our limited domestic production isn't enough. But we have many ways to salvage the situation before it's too late. Speaking of lack of funds, that's the fifth and final internal issue, which will require extensive and quick reforms. Next, the external ones. First, conflicts in Saddle Arabia and Great Lakes have greatly reduced our trade income," he said, pointing at the two regions which appeared deceptively unified on the outdated map, "making it difficult to refill our treasury." Then he pointed at Purrsia. "Second, the monarchist Wingbardian government still sees us as part of their sphere of influence." His stick moved eastwards towards the Neighle. "Third, Maregypt's revanchists continue to urge their government to 'liberate' Coltuba from our rule. At this rate, they might launch a military offensive against us." He stopped for a moment, as if to think about what to say, then pointed at the lands south of Abyssinia. "Lastly, our relations with the donkey states of Asstyria and Anseruk are... fine, in fact, at least for now." He turned to look at Gomez again. "Any questions, my King?""
 abyssinia.29.a:0 ""...I need a moment to think.""
 
 abyssinia.30.t:0 "Monetary Reform"
 abyssinia.30.d:0 ""How much do you know about monetary systems?" Dejen asked from the King.\n"Uuh... I know the basics. And I might remember some of them, too."\n"I will keep it simple, then. Currently, our currency, the purr, is based on the gold standard. And I am certain you are aware of our lack of any gold. This has caused severe economic issues such as deflation, bank runs and a decline of economic activity. These issues are so severe, in fact, that we should've implemented reforms as soon as possible."\nGomez sighed painfully. "I am sorry."\n"Apology accepted. Now, you have a decision to make. I have investigated our options and consolidated them into three. Two of them are similar: we peg the value of our currency to the value of another one. This will bring financial stability, but will make us more dependent on whatever currency we choose. My two proposals are the Equestrian bit and the Skyfallian idol. Both are reliable, valuable and extensively used in global trade. Either of them would function as our reserve currency. The third option is to simply not have a fixed currency at all. A floating exchange rate would be a more unorthodox choice, but would allow us to recover more quickly from the crisis and enable us to increase our money supply as much as necessary. This could lead to excessive inflation, however, so we'd have to be more careful than with the other two alternatives."\n\nGomez frowned. He believed he had understood most of what Dejen had said, but he'd still have to weigh the different options carefully. There wasn't a clear solution to this issue."
 abyssinia.30.a:0 ""Let's go with the bit.""
 abyssinia.30.b:0 ""The Wingbardians don't use the idol, do they?""
