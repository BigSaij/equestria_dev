 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen"
 ABY_taile_sehissie_clawomonid_desc:0 "Gomez Mawkonnen of the House of Clawomon has a heritage of over a thousand years, so expectations have always been high for him, especially as he is the grandson of the famous Queen Mewodora the Second who restored the dynasty to the throne of Abyssinia. He was raised in the royal palace of Panthera and his father King Mawkonnen ensured he was given the best education money could buy, which prepared him for his future as his heir. As a student, he was proficient, even if lacking in passion, and excelled at economics, mathematics and history. Already at a young age he fell in love with his cousin Morticia, but was unable to marry her for a long time due to cousin marriage being strongly frowned upon. When Mawkonnen died in 998 ALB, Gomez was more than ready to succeed him and, with his royal authority, was able to immediately marry Morticia. He was fully aware of the many potential problems that threatened Abyssinia, and planned to deal with them before it was too late.\n\nUnfortunately, black cats aren't known for their luck.\n\nAs soon as news of the Storm King's rapid conquests arrived, Gomez began preparing defences and building up the royal army. But despite his best efforts, he had no counter to his airships and Abyssinia's cities fell one by one. In the end, when Panthera burned and he had lost a part of his right ear, he finally surrendered, offering his crown to the Storm King. But just as quickly as he had arrived, the Storm King left, leaving behind a devastated, impoverished kingdom.\n\nWith his dreams shattered and his kingdom on the brink of collapse, Gomez's mental state worsened rapidly as he was unable to cope with the stress. Time will tell if he is able to recover and face his daunting challenges."

 ABY_catrina_catwe:0 "Catrina Tabby"
 ABY_catrina_catwe_desc:0 "Catrina is a direct descendant of the Catwe kings and queens who once ruled Abyssinia for two hundred years. While this makes her technically a noble, she has no special legal privileges or formal status as the Clawomons stripped her family of any such things. Nevertheless, she is far more wealthy and influential than any mere common cat. While her relatives were kept in check by a strong central government, Catrina was able to use the recent chaos as a ladder to climb up in Abyssinian society. With many blaming the Clawomons for the numerous problems that plagued the Kingdom, she proposed herself as a tempting alternative. The nobles were especially dissatisfied with the Clawomons due to their modernizing reforms, and many of them quickly rallied behind Catrina, as out of all pretenders to the throne, she has by far the strongest claim to the throne.\n\nBut Catrina has no intention of being a mere lackey of the nobles. The invasion of the Storm King opened up her eyes to a simple truth of life: it is better to be among the mighty than caged at someone's command. Abyssinia had long been dominated by foreign powers and other races, but she had ambitious plans that would change everything. Underneath her family mansion, she conducts secret experiments that may well change the fate of catkind forever..."

 ABY_catto:0 "Catto"
 ABY_catto_desc:0 ""Squeak.""
 ABY_queen_morticia:0 "Morticia Addisu"
 ABY_queen_morticia_desc:0 "Being born as a daughter of King Mawkonnen's sister Addisu meant that Morticia was privileged from the start as one of the members of the House of Clawomon. Yet unlike some of her relatives, she never let it inflate her ego. A kittenhood friendship with a servant ensured she'd feel empathy for those who were deemed "commoners" in Abyssinian society. After her mother's death, she used her inherited wealth for philanthropy and buying freedom for slaves owned by the Kingdom's nobility. While she had to firmly stand her ground against most of her family, her cousin Gomez admired her generosity and kindness. As the two lived under the same roof, they had long been familiar with each other. However, it came as a shock to their relatives when they announced that they were lovers. Gomez's father King Mawkonnen disapproved of the relationship and forbade their marriage. The two had to wait until his death to finally hold a private wedding ceremony by themselves. Thus, Morticia became Queen consort of Abyssinia.\n\nDespite the controversy with her husband and the fact that the nobility look down upon her, Morticia is very popular among the common cats. This is because she genuinely cares for their well-being and, thanks to her confidence, acts as the public face of the monarchy while Gomez is more withdrawn. Nevertheless, some radicals still believe she is just acting or pretending and that she only gave out wealth to increase her own popularity and influence."
 ABY_nathaniel_claw:0 "Nathaniel Claw"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen:0 "Dejen Rees-Moggy"
 ABY_sourpuss_dejen_desc:0 "Ever since being a kitten, Dejen has been fascinated with statecraft. He was born to a middle-class family and his parents poured all their savings to afford a good education for him. Thankfully, he was naturally gifted at absorbing and handling information, even if his peers saw him as distant and emotionless. As Abyssinia modernized, it started to develop a fledgling modern bureaucracy which was always in need of cats like Dejen, who loved nothing more than dull paperwork. Within a few years, King Mawkonnen recognized Dejen's talents and appointed him as the new Minister of the Pen, Tsehafe Taezaz. This made him the King's right-paw cat, who ensured all his commands would be fulfilled in practice. He served Mawkonne for only a short time however before he passed away and his son Gomez inherited the throne. Despite all the difficulties during his reign, Dejen tolerated him and focused on doing his job. Yet after the Storm King's invasion broke Gomez's mind completely, he wondered if someone more competent could replace him. After all, he always cared more about Abyssinia than about the monarch."
 ABY_colonel_meow:0 "Meow Frown"
 ABY_colonel_meow_desc:0 "While formally being the General of the Crown Guard, Meow Frown is widely known as "The Colonel". He is the highest ranking professional soldier in the Kingdom, having served in the Guard for many years and proving his devotion to the Kingdom of Abyssinia. During the Storm King's invasion, he led the defence of Panthera and his forces inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy despite being outnumbered. The Crown Guard stood by Gomez's side even as he surrendered to the invader.\n\nOutside of his military career, Meow is known for holding the world record for longest cat fur. Despite his scowl, he is rather friendly off-duty, especially after he has drunk some of his favourite scotch."

 ### National Spirits
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia. This treaty was seen as fair. However, after the Storm King invaded and greatly weakened Abyssinia, Wingbardy forced King Gomez to sign another treaty. This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat. While the economy benefits from Wingbardian activity, most of the populace resents the treaty."
 ABY_angry_slaves:0 "Slave Unrest"
 ABY_angry_slaves_desc:0 "After Queen Mewodora II outlawed feline slavery, famously proclaiming all cats to be free, slaveowners exploited a legal loophole which did not explicitly forbid enslavement of other races. Over the century, hundreds of thousands of slaves have been acquired from abroad, either through trade or force. These slaves are for the most part ponies, donkeys, zebras and horses. Following the Storm King's invasion, many of them rose up against their owners, starting a spiral of deadly violence that could escalate out of control."
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership:0 "Paralyzed Government"
 ABY_paralyzed_leadership_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Abyssinia has traditionally been an absolute monarchy ruled by decree. However, King Gomez's poor mental state has resulted in the government being left completely idle, unable to do anything without the King's approval or command. Normally this would be enough of a problem, but in times of crisis decisions are urgently needed, yet no one makes them. As a result, Abyssinia is becoming increasingly chaotic and the aristocats are beginning to question Gomez's ability to rule."
 ABY_risk_of_famine:0 "Risk Of Famine"
 ABY_risk_of_famine_desc:0 "The Abyssinian peninsula is a dry region largely unsuited for agriculture, with many cats in the countryside still living as pastoralists. Worse still, arable land in the highlands is used for growing cash crops for export such as coffee. As cats are also obligate carnivores, the rest of arable land is used for cattle fodder. Before the Storm King's invasion, Abyssinia was perfectly capable of importing tonnes of meat from abroad, but with an empty, sacked treasury and ever increasing internal instability, these imports have almost completely ceased. Food stocks are slowly but surely becoming completely empty. If nothing is done, starvation will threaten almost the entire populace."
 
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_2:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_2_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia.

This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat.\n\nThe Abyssinian government has taken action to mitigate the effects of the treaty at the expense of reduced cooperation with Wingbardy."
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_3:0 "The Unequal Treaty"
 ABY_wingbardian_concessions_3_desc:0 "After the Clawomonic Restoration, Queen Mewodora II signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Wingbardy which stipulated that Abyssinia would get aid in modernizing the country while in return Wingbardy would get economic privileges as well as the Rasdom of Purrsia as a protectorate, which allowed them to secure their vital trade routes with Saddle Arabia.

This acknowledged the Wingbardian seizure of the port city of Katren as legal (called "the Katren concession"), established a demilitarized zone around it in Katkat and gave further privileges to Wingbardian businesses, including exclusive mining rights in Katkat.\n\nDue to the recent actions by the Abyssinian government, the treaty is now little more than ink on paper."

 ABY_clawomonid_resistance_desc:0 "Some aristocats remain loyal to the House of Claowmon.

 ABY_pegged_to_bit:0 "Pegged To The Bit"
 ABY_pegged_to_bit_desc:0 "The Abyssinian currency, the purr, has been moved away from the gold standard and now has a fixed exchange rate to the Equestrian bit."
 ABY_pegged_to_idol:0 "Pegged To The Idol"
 ABY_pegged_to_idol_desc:0 "The Abyssinian currency, the purr, has been moved away from the gold standard and now has a fixed exchange rate to the Skyfallian idol."

 ABY_trade_deal:0 "Trade Agreement With Abyssinia"
 ABY_trade_deal_desc:0 "A treaty has been signed with Abyssinia which eliminates tariffs, duties, quotas and restrictions on trade of items between our two nations."
 ABY_HIP_trade_deal:0 "Trade Agreement With Hippogriffia"
 ABY_HIP_trade_deal_desc:0 "A treaty has been signed with Hippogriffia which eliminates tariffs, duties, quotas and restrictions on trade of items between our two nations."

 ABY_ASS_trade_deal_desc:0 "A treaty has been signed with Asstyria which eliminates tariffs, duties, quotas and restrictions on trade of items between our two nations."
 ABY_ANS_trade_deal:0 "Trade Agreement With Anseruk"
 ABY_ANS_trade_deal_desc:0 "A treaty has been signed with Anseruk which eliminates tariffs, duties, quotas and restrictions on trade of items between our two nations."
 ABY_HIP_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Hippogriffia"
 ABY_HIP_food_imports_desc:0 "The existing trade agreement has made it easy for Abyssinian merchants to import food en masse from Hippogriffia. Unlike most neighbouring countries, hippogriffs do consume meat, and the seaponies are expert fishers. As such, they have an infrastructure in place to produce enough meat for export at a relatively low price."
 ABY_WNG_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Wingbardy"
 ABY_WNG_food_imports_desc:0 "The existing economic ties have made it easy for Abyssinian merchants to import food en masse from Wingbardy. Unlike most neighbouring countries, griffons do consume meat, and the Wingbardians are more than happy to export some to Abyssinian markets. However, they are also trying to profit as much as possible while knowing Abyssinia's desperate need for food, so the prices aren't fair in the slightest."
 ABY_KLG_food_imports:0 "Food Imports From Klugetown"
 ABY_KLG_food_imports_desc:0 "Despite not recognizing Klugetown's sovereignty, Abyssinia has been forced to import food from it. How the Klugetowners are able to provide so much meat for export is a mystery, however, and it is hard to say what sort of creatures were butchered for their flesh."
 ABY_mild_famine:0 "Food Shortages"
 ABY_mild_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen greatly recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season. However, government intervention has ensured that food doesn't completely run out and that the hungry are able to get at least something to survive the difficult times."
 ABY_famine:0 "Famine"
 ABY_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen exponentially recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season. Despite some government intervention, hundreds of thousands of cats are unable to acquire food and some are even resorting to hunting rats and birds. Rural cats are fleeing the countryside into cities, hoping to find food, only to end up starving to death on the streets."
 ABY_apocalyptic_famine:0 "Apocalyptic Famine"
 ABY_apocalyptic_famine_desc:0 "The price of food, especially meat products consumed by cats, has risen to absurd numbers recently. This is due to the drought of the 1008 wet season. With no government intervention, millions of cats are unable to acquire food and many are resorting to hunting rats and birds. Rural cats are fleeing the countryside into cities, hoping to find food, only to end up starving to death on the streets. There are so many corpses that mass graves are being dug all across Abyssinia."
 ABY_a_good_friend:0 "A Good Friend"
 ABY_a_good_friend_desc:0 "During an event where King Gomez met with commoners at the central market of Panthera, a dark blue cat saw it as a great opportunity to show how rebellious she was by bonking him on the head with a baseball bat (albeit without much force). When the Crown Guard attempted to catch her, she climbed atop a lamp pole with remarkable dexterity, resulting in a miniature siege. The king himself intervened, and, contrary to what anyone was expecting him to say, thanked her for hitting him. He then ordered the guard to stand down. The dark blue cat descended and apologized to the king, offering him a pretzel out of all things. Gomez had no idea where she had gotten Griffonian food from, especially as cats were carnivores and did not eat baked goods, but accepted the apology nonetheless. This was the start of a rather peculiar friendship."
 ABY_gomez_son:0 "[Root.ABY_son_name_loc]"
 ABY_gomez_son_desc:0 "Somehow, the son of Gomez and Morticia has a black and white coat and light blue eyes. Recessive genes, probably."
 ABY_new_economic_plan:0 "The New Modernization Plan"
 ABY_new_economic_plan_desc:0 "The newly created economic plan takes into account the current situation of Abyssinia. While at its core it remains the same as previous plans, it seeks to make the nation more self-reliant while also seeking more diverse cooperation with foreign countries. Mostly liberal economic policies combined with state intervention to stimulate growth and development remain in place."
 ABY_new_economic_plan_2:0 "The New Modernization Plan"
 ABY_new_economic_plan_2_desc:0 "The newly created economic plan takes into account the current situation of Abyssinia. While at its core it remains the same as previous plans, it seeks to make the nation more self-reliant while also seeking more diverse cooperation with foreign countries. Mostly liberal economic policies combined with state intervention to stimulate growth and development remain in place."
 ABY_high_taxes:0 "High Taxes"
 ABY_high_taxes_desc:0 "Taxes are the primary source of income for any government. However, citizens tend to dislike having to contribute a portion of their hard-earned income for the greater good of the nation. Especially rich citizens, who usually worked the least to earn their wealth. "
 ABY_loan:0 "Foreign Loan"
 ABY_loan_desc:0 "Abyssinia has secured a loan with a reasonable interest rate from an overseas bank. Eventually, it will have to be paid back, but that's a concern for future generations. For now, it's sufficient to simply pay the interest."
 ABY_brrrrrrrr:0 "Inflation Surge"
 ABY_brrrrrrrr_desc:0 "The State Bank of Abyssinia controls the monetary supply of the Kingdom. As such, nothing stops it from just making money, especially now that the gold standard has been abandoned. However, filling the treasury in such an artificial manner will result in a temporary increase of inflation."

 ABY_assess_situation_desc:0 "The King has finally decided to retake the reins of the Kingdom and has agreed to attend a long-delayed meeting with me regarding the current critical status of the realm. While his mental state seems to have somewhat stabilized, it remains to be seen if he is actually capable of making decisions and giving orders again."
 
 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia:0 "Replace The Bank Of Abyssinia"
 ABY_nationalize_bank_of_abyssinia_desc:0 "During his reign, King Mawkonnen had founded the Bank of Abyssinia, a monopolized private bank which originated as a concession to Wingbardy's national bank. With the recent economic instability, I advise that this near-bankrupt bank is liquidated and replaced with a fully state-owned bank that will give us greater control of the economy."
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard:0 "Abandon The Gold Standard"
 ABY_abandon_gold_standard_desc:0 "For about a century now, the Abyssinian purr has been a gold standard currency, backed by the royal treasury of the monarchy. Unfortunately, the Storm King's recent unauthorized permanent loan has caused rapid deflation due to lack of gold. I've been saying this for a while now, but it is finally time to move away from the gold standard."
 ABY_seek_trade_partners:0 "Seek New Trade Partners"
 ABY_seek_trade_partners_desc:0 "Abyssinia has long been a trading nation, yet the Storm King's invasion and resulting regional instability have left many merchants idle. The Negadras, head of the merchants, has proposed we try to sign trade agreements with more countries to open up new markets for us. Exporting goods such as coffee will help us refill our treasury."
 ABY_refill_treasury:0 "Refill The Royal Treasury"
 ABY_refill_treasury_desc:0 "With foundations for economic recovery laid, we can now focus on our crippling lack of funds. There are several options to weigh against each other, each of them with positive and negative aspects. You will have to decide which method we shall use to restore some of your lost wealth."
 ABY_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 ABY_public_works_projects_desc:0 "Public spending is one way to recover from economic disasters. Until now, we've lacked the funds, but thanks to the recent endeavours we can finally launch infrastructure projects across the Kingdom. This will provide jobs for thousands of cats. I also recommend we do not employ any slaves, as their salaries would likely be seized by their owners."
 ABY_royal_reconstruction_program:0 "Royal Reconstruction Program"
 ABY_royal_reconstruction_program_desc:0 "Everything is finally in place. Now it is time to launch a large-scale nationwide effort to fully recover from the Storm King's invasion. It will be expensive enough to empty our treasury again, but afterwards we will be able to refill it much more easily than before."
 
 ABY_expand_fishing_fleet:0 "Expand Fishing Fleet"
 ABY_expand_fishing_fleet_desc:0 "With how dry the Abyssinian peninsula is, many cats rely on fishing to feed themselves especially on the coast. To improve food security, I recommend we invest our recently expanded funds into our fisheries. They will be able to hire more fishercats expand their infrastructure to build more fishing vessels. Of course, this infrastructure could have other uses as well."
 ABY_import_food:0 "Import Food"
 ABY_import_food_desc:0 "Abyssinia hasn't been self-reliant on food for many decades now, after much of our limited farmlands were dedicated to growing cash crops like coffee. Now that we've attempted to establish new trade routes, our merchants have the capital they need to restart food imports. Unfortunately, most of our neighbours are herbivores and we need meat more urgently than cattle feed, so our options are limited."
 ABY_distribute_food:0 "Open Soup Kitchens"
 ABY_distribute_food_desc:0 "The main cause of hunger is not necessarily food production, but distribution. Due to feudal taxation, many peasants cannot afford to buy food when they are unable to produce enough themselves. To increase societal food security, Queen Morticia proposes that we should establish food distribution centers or "soup kitchens" to provide free meals for the hungry cats."
 ABY_repurpose_plantations:0 "Plantations Into Pastures"
 ABY_repurpose_plantations_desc:0 "Much of the arable land in Abyssinia is currently used for growing cash crops, especially coffee. While it brings great wealth to merchants and landowners, it means we do not produce enough food domestically. With various laws and economic incentives, we can push plantations to be slowly turned into pastures for cattle. Not everycat will be happy with this arrangement."
 
 ABY_pacify_slaves_focus:0 "Slave Pacification Operations"
 ABY_pacify_slaves_focus_desc:0 "The unfortunate truth is that we cannot allow the slaves to run rampant, even if their grievances are justified. The only method of quickly restoring law and order is by force, as any attempts to negotiate or promise reforms have failed. Nevertheless, we only do this because we must. After peace has returned, I strongly recommend we attempt to abolish slavery."
 ABY_ban_slave_bulli:0 "Outlaw Mistreatment Of Slaves"
 ABY_ban_slave_bulli_desc:0 "Abyssinian law is written with the assumption that slavery is outlawed entirely, even if it is only outlawed for cats. As such, there are no clauses regarding the treatment of slaves. To quell dissatisfaction of enslaved persons, I recommend you to decree that their mistreatment becomes a punishable crime. Some nobles won't be happy, but the slaves will be."
 ABY_ban_slave_trade:0 "End The Slave Trade"
 ABY_ban_slave_trade_desc:0 "After feline slavery was brought to a sudden end, imports of slaves into Abyssinia increased drastically as trade of non-feline slaves had not been forbidden. Banning all trade of slaves would be a controversial move, as it would largely end the lucrative business (which would also no doubt continue illegally), but I still recommend we do it."
 ABY_ban_slave_baby:0 "Freedom Of Wombs"
 ABY_ban_slave_baby_desc:0 "So far, slave owners have assumed that any offspring of slaves automatically become slaves, similarly to how offspring of cattle automatically becomes property of the owner of the parents. However, if we pass a law where all sapient creatures in the Kingdom are born free, then the slave population will stop growing naturally."
 ABY_emancipation_act:0 "The Emancipation Act"
 ABY_emancipation_act_desc:0 "With the gradual erosion of the institution of slavery, we can finally deliver the final death blow to this ancient practice. The Emancipation Act will rewrite Queen Mewodora II's slavery act by clearly stating the following: "All persons held as slaves in the Kingdom shall forever be free, and their freedom shall be guaranteed by the King.""
 
 ABY_revised_plan:0 "Revised Modernization Plan"
 ABY_revised_plan_desc:0 "King Mawkonnen's economic development plan, which you continued to follow until the Storm King's forceful restructuring of our economy, relied heavily on cooperation with Wingbardy. Now that they have shown their true colors, we need to formulate a new plan for the modernization of Abyssinia."
 ABY_noble_council:0 "Summon The Council Of Nobility"
 ABY_noble_council_desc:0 "Implemeting the modernization plan will require cooperation with local governors who manage economic affairs.

 ABY_protectionist_taxation:0 "Protectionist Taxation"
 ABY_protectionist_taxation_desc:0 "Your predecessors trusted the griffons, and in return they immediately sought to exploit our Kingdom. So far, foreign companies have been given concessions to conduct business freely, but this gives them an unfair advantage. By introducing new taxes, we will force them out of Abyssinia and allow our domestic businesses to grow."
 ABY_merchant_council:0 "Summon The Negadrases"
 ABY_merchant_council_desc:0 "Implemeting the modernization plan will require cooperation with local merchants who are most directly impacted by our policies.

 abyssinia.1.d:0 "Boom. Boom. Smash. The steel battering ram shattered the gates of the royal palace. A grey, ape-like head with a horned crown peeked inside. "Hellooooo? Anybody home?"\n\nIt was the Storm King.\n\nKing Gomez embraced his wife and consort, Queen Morticia, as the towering armored yeti walked inside accompanied by his masked soldiers. "Hope you don't mind me letting myself in. But I practically own the place already, don't I?" he said with a smug yet casual smirk, then bowed mockingly. "Your majesties. King and Queen of Abyssinia. You should surrender. Now."\nThe glow of the burning city of Panthera shone through the gates. Gomez sighed deeply as his courtiers stared at him, then slowly took off his golden crown and offered it to the yeti. "...Storm King. You have conquered this nation. Abyssinia is yours."\nThe Storm King took the crown, then immediately crushed it. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really into the whole 'ruling' thing. You folks can keep Abyssinia."\nGomez blinked in confusion. "W-what?"\n"I know I call myself a 'King', but frankly, monarchy just isn't my thing. You take over one country, next thing you're dealing with taxes and committees and retirement packages!" With his large hands, he molded the crown into a crude ring which he put on one of his three large fingers. "No, I don't want Abyssinia - just its riches." He leaned closer to Gomez, who reflexively shielded Morticia from him. "The treasure vaults of Abyssinia are filled with strange and exotic wonders, so they say. Magical artifacts, flawless jewels, golden trinkets. I'd like them all, please."\n"You want - our wealth?" Gomez asked.\n"Running a whole armada is expensive, you know. You wouldn't believe the upkeep on all those airships!"\n"You - you can't!" Morticia shrieked. "Abyssinia is a trade nation. We need our wealth to import crops, feed our citizens, build our homes! Please, you must leave us something!"\nThe Storm King frowned melodramatically. "Oh, I will. After I empty your vaults, I'll leave you alone."\n"Wait! You can't! We'll have nothing left! Why have you destroyed Abyssinia?"\nThe Storm King grinned in a way that Gomez wouldn't forget. "Because it was next on my list.""

He groaned and looked at an ornate grandfather clock that stood near the bed.\n\nIt was four in the afternoon. He had slept for six hours.\n\nSlowly, he pushed himself up, yawned and rubbed his burning eyes. Then he simply sat there, staring into nothingness.\n\nAfter glancing at the door which appeared to be locked, he lowered himself onto the floor and crawled underneath the bed, digging up his secret stash of fresh khatnip leaves. He put a pawful in his mouth, then chewed on it. He purred and rolled on the floor as his pupils dilated and he felt alive again.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nGomez immediately pushed himself up, hit his head on the bottom of the bed, and quickly climbed back out. "W-what in the... why didn't you knock?" he mumbled with khatnip in his mouth. His trusted right paw cat, Tsehafe Taezaz, Minister of the Pen, Scribe by Command, Dejen Rees-Moggy, stood in the doorway, completely unfazed.\n"I did, my King, but you didn't seem to hear it. I wanted to ask you if you've finally decided when we can have a meeting."\nGomez spat out the khatnip and straightened himself. "I... haven't. Not today, at least."\n"You can't postpone this forever, your Majesty."\n"I... I know," he replied and lowered his ears.\nDejen rolled his eyes. "Also, I wanted to remind you that your wife has prepared a meal for you. She's been waiting for a while."\nGomez's eyes widened. "Oh, Tartarus! I forgot about it!"

"But we have dinner every day?"\n"Uuuh... yes, but... ah, it doesn't matter." He sat down on the opposite end of the table, his shoulders slumped. "What are we having today."\n"In solidarity with our hungering subjects, we are only having a little bit of kibble. I even arranged for a cat to take a photograph of our meal so it could appear in the newspapers, but... he had to leave after waiting for an hour."\nGomez groaned and rubbed his forehead. "That's my fault, sorry."\nMorticia forced a smile. "It's fine! We can still enjoy the meal."\nThe khatnip was making Gomez's mind foggy. "Sorry, but I'm not really hungry."\n"But you haven't eaten since yesterday?"\n"I know..."\n\nThere was an extended moment of silence as Morticia looked at her husband with concern. Things were only getting worse and worse, she thought. "My darling, you need help. You are sick."\n"Am I? Or do I just see things more clearly than others?" he muttered.\nMorticia sighed. "I understand you better than anyone else, and I can tell something is wrong. And I just want you to be happy again."\nGomez stared blankly into his plate of kibble, then replied:"

 abyssinia.4.d:0 "The decrepit stone mansion of the Catwe dynasty was usually a quiet place, yet now it was filled with hundreds of cats, most of whom were servants. A dozen litters, including elaborate palanquins as well as sedan chairs, were waiting for their owners outside along with their slave-carriers. A few of the slaves, who were horses and ponies, were not carriers but steeds and used the opportunity to relax and take off their saddles.\n\nIn the meantime, the nobles had all gathered in a conference room. The owner of the mansion and the host of the meeting, Catrina of House Catwe, was filing her claws. One of the aristocats coughed. "It is impolite to keep us waiting, Catrina," Tsahife Lam Tardar Sourpuss, muttered.\nCatrina admired the sharpness of her claws and smiled. "I am the host of this house, and I decide when the meeting starts. And it starts now." She turned to look at the nobles. At least half of the most important aristocats in the Kingdom had gathered here, and all of them supported her claim to the throne. "I am glad all of you accepted my invitation, as we need to decide our next course of action. Thankfully, I have the perfect plan to depose our indecisive King, who is clearly unfit to rule."\n"You always promise us the sun and the moon," Tardar replied dryly, "but you are no alicorn."\nNot yet, Catrina thought, and wondered if Tardar really was always this grumpy, or if her face was stuck in a perpetual frown.

Maybe your mood is linked to some sickness? Alternatively, you might just need a break from everything. Rulership can be very stressful, after all. I've asked various cats about where you could go on vacation, and one of them suggested visiting the Rock-hewn Temples of Felibela in Jirati. I sent a message to the priests there and they'd be more than happy to welcome you. If you leave, I could stay here and act as regent. Lastly, we have plenty of relatives who are concerned about you. We could hold a family gathering and see if they can help you feel any better. How do these options sound, my darling? Which one do you think is best?"\n\nGomez blinked slowly. "Uuuuh... they're all fine, I guess."\nMorticia's smile faded slightly. "Well, you have to pick one, as we can't do all of them at once."\nHe rubbed his aching forehead. "Ugh, alright.

I am the rightful owner of this place, after all."\nHe raised an eyebrow. "...Catrina of House Catwe?"\n"Mhm, you know your history, at least. Let me cut to the chase: I want to acquire information."\nHis eyes narrowed.

With evidence, preferably."\n"And why would I give you anything?"\n"Tell me, are you pleased with the rule of King Gomez? You can be honest with me."\nDejen hesitated rather than answering.\n"None of us are," Catrina hissed. "And you can help me to replace him with someone better."\n"Yourself?"\nCatrina laughed.

By the end of it, he was completely exhausted, but at least the medical experts had enough data now to come to some sort of conclusion. They all agreed that he had depression or melancholia. However, they did not agree what the cause was or how he should be treated.\n"He clearly has an imbalance of humours in his body, an excess of black bile!" one doctor said.

There was no railroad in the region, so he and his entourage had arrived by boat in Catemte, then taken a winding unpaved road up the mountains. He had been seated in an expensive imported car before it broke down, and then was carried on a palanquin by servants who were quickly exhausted. Unlike the nobles, he did not have sturdy equines as slaves, but rather free cats who were paid a salary. And with an empty treasury, they hadn't been paid enough to carry him all the way up. In the end, the King was walking.\n\nOn the way to the temples they passed by an isolated village. The locals poured out of their houses to see the King with their own eyes. One of them was a young kitten, who was wearing rags and appeared emaciated. He approached Gomez and asked: "You're the King, right? Why do you look so sad?"\nGomez sighed. "I carry the weight of the Kingdom on my shoulders, little one."\n"But you wear such fancy clothes and jewels! And I bet you have lots of food and a HUGE mansion and the BIGGEST ball of yarn in the world!"\n"I... have some of those, I suppose."\n"Then how can you be sad? If I was you, I'd be so happy!"\nThis kitten was still so naïve and simple, Gomez thought. "You already seem happy yourself, despite having nothing."\nThe kitten giggled. "I have lots of fun with my friends!"\nThe King had a faint, wistful smile. He took out a gold coin which he had hidden from the Storm King inside his robes, and gave it to the kitten.

Her relatives didn't listen.\n\nThe constant chatter and noise of cats of all ages was deafening, and King Gomez felt like he was going to get a headache. His already minimal appetite had become non-existent.\n"What's wrong Gomy?" his old uncle asked. "Not going to touch your food?"\n"It's probably because he's 'depressed'!" his cousin thrice removed said.\n"Depression isn't real," his sister-in-law said. "Snap out of it!"\n"He has it easy!" his brother-in-law hissed. "I lost my home, my leg and my wealth during the Storm King's invasion, but you don't see me frowning!"\n"Yeah, don't be sad, Gomy!" his aunt said. "Just look on the bright side of life and appreciate all the good things in it!"\n"It's all in your head," mother-in-law said. "Why do you let it affect you so much?"\nHis godfather drank some katikala and laughed. "He needs to have more fun in life, that's all!"\n\nGomez groaned and visibly shrunk. His wife, who was sitting next to him, noticed this. "Can all of you be quiet?!" she hissed at their relatives, then turned to whisper into Gomez's ear. "This was a mistake.

The town was insignificant and the temples were maintained only by the priests who continued to live in them. However, recently the location had become famous and rejuvenated.\n\nUnlike Felibela, King Gomez was not feeling rejuvenated. Now that he had seen the temples, he wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. It all started feeling like a waste of time, so he sat down on a rock. Nearby, an old statue of Baast stood, the four-legged creator goddess of catkind. He looked at it and wondered if she had made a mistake granting sapience to his ancestors. Maybe he'd be happier if he was a wild cat, chasing mice and what not?\n\n"And who are you?"\nGomez turned his head and saw an old grey cat adorned in pure white robes.

No, and you have to water it often and take good care of it."\n"I see."\n"But while we're walking, we might as well be talking! The problems of your mind are two-pronged. Self-doubt comes from being too worried about being good enough for others, when you should focus on being good enough for yourself. Self-hatred comes from preferring to blame yourself rather than others, and not letting go of the past. Thankfully, it is possible to treat these unwholesome thoughts through Baast's gifts of self-awareness and self-control, but these abilities need to be trained. Your case is far from hopeless."\nGomez nodded slowly and didn't say anything for a while. Then he asked: "You're a priest. I thought you would've only been good at reciting the Three Scriptures and nothing more."\n"Our duty is to be the spiritual pillar of society. Baast gifted us sapient minds, giving us the ability to escape the cycle of suffering that animals are doomed to endure. However, many cats do not know how to use their gifts.

Like that, yes. Then breathe, control it. Slow and steady. Feel your breaths, feel the air in your lungs. Next you can extend your awareness further. How does the rest of your body feel? How does your mind feel? Register emotions within you. You cannot grasp fog, you must hold solid things. As such your thoughts and feelings must become controllable. Think of something that makes you unhappy or distressed. The burning city of Panthera, for example. Then think of what makes you happy, or what made you happy before. Like your wife. What emotions do they cause, if any? Face them. Permit them to pass over you and through you. Your feelings don't define who you are. You define yourself. Let the negative compounding thoughts go on. Don't judge yourself if you can't succeed at first. Don't judge yourself at all. Every sapient creature is flawed.

I wasn't sure either," Gomez replied.\n"Well, because this has taken long enough to happen, I will get straight to the point. My overview will cover the internal and external situation of the Kingdom. I will start with the former." He had placed a large map of Abyssinia behind him and had a pointing stick in his paw. "When I wrote this presentation, my largest concern was the nobility, but since then their threat has diminished. Nevertheless, many nobles remain dissatisfied with your rule for understandable reasons. They will need to be reminded of your legitimacy and competence. The second internal issue is slavery. There is every reason to outlaw it fully and emancipate our million slaves, but the aforementioned nobles strongly oppose this. Yet not doing so will lead to constant slave revolts that are costly to pacify." He pointed at Coltoba with his stick. "The third issue is Manedalusia. Tensions remain over the conflict we had with Maregypt years ago, and the local secessionist movement has utilized recent chaos to grow in strength. The fourth issue is famine. Without funds to import food, our limited domestic production isn't enough. But we have many ways to salvage the situation before it's too late. Speaking of lack of funds, that's the fifth and final internal issue, which will require extensive and quick reforms. Next, the external ones. First, conflicts in Saddle Arabia and Great Lakes have greatly reduced our trade income," he said, pointing at the two regions which appeared deceptively unified on the outdated map, "making it difficult to refill our treasury." Then he pointed at Purrsia. "Second, the monarchist Wingbardian government still sees us as part of their sphere of influence." His stick moved eastwards towards the Neighle. "Third, Maregypt's revanchists continue to urge their government to 'liberate' Coltoba from our rule. At this rate, they might launch a military offensive against us." He stopped for a moment, as if to think about what to say, then pointed at the lands south of Abyssinia. "Lastly, our relations with the donkey states of Asstyria and Anseruk are... fine, in fact, at least for now." He turned to look at Gomez again. "Any questions, my King?""

Currently, our currency, the purr, is based on the gold standard. And I am certain you are aware of our lack of any gold. This has caused severe economic issues such as deflation, bank runs and a decline of economic activity. These issues are so severe, in fact, that we should've implemented reforms as soon as possible."\nGomez rubbed his forehead with his claws. "I am sorry."\n"Apology accepted. Now, you have a decision to make. I have investigated our options and consolidated them into three. Two of them are similar: we peg the value of our currency to the value of another one. This will bring financial stability and make it easy to loan funds from abroad, but will make us more dependent on whatever currency we choose. My two proposals are the Equestrian bit and the Skyfallian idol. Both are reliable, valuable and extensively used in global trade. Either of them would function as our reserve currency. The third option is to simply not have a fixed currency at all. A floating exchange rate would be a more unorthodox choice, but would allow us to recover more quickly from the crisis and enable us to increase our money supply as much as necessary. This could lead to excessive inflation, however, so we'd have to be more careful than with the other two alternatives."\n\nGomez frowned.

 ssinia.55.d:0 "Baastism is a name commonly used by outsiders to refer to the traditional racial faith of Abyssinian cats. It is centered around Baast, a legendary four-legged sapient cat who allegedly overthrew the Tyrant King Anubis of ancient Anugypt and sacrificed herself to create the Abyssinian race. As this was the end of Baast's ninth and final life, she is considered to be a dead deity. Baastism therefore focuses on following her way of life rather than prayer or obedience.\n\nThe core principle of Baastism is the cycle of rebirth, where a cat can live nine lives before facing eternal oblivion and non-existence. Baast escaped this fate through achieving eternal metaphysical existence by eliminating desire and the self. Baastists thus seek to emulate her by purifying their minds in a similar manner. They do not believe that animals, such as house cats, are capable of this and see sapience as Baast's gift meant to be used to liberate themselves from suffering and nothingness.\n\nThe religion has a priesthood who maintain isolated temples that are used for worship and meditation. The core function of the priests is teaching others to live like Baast did and help them achieve enlightenment. There are very few, if any, Baastists who are not Abyssinian cats, due to the focus on Baast's relationship with her "creations". Those non-cats who do follow Baast's way of life do so hoping to achieve similar salvation, seeking to live as virtuously as her.\n\nThere are several unorthodox variants of Baastism which have few followers. They interpret the legend of Baast's life differently, some even claiming she still exists and actively intervenes in temporal affairs like a regular god.

 abyssinia.61.d_gomez:0 "Gilippo Gappi knew this would happen. Mostly because it was meant to happen. It was part of the policy of the Wingbardian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to keep pushing Abyssinians until they'd break, or until they pushed back, which would give a good excuse for military action. But as far as he was concerned, this was all a waste of time. The Ministry lacked ambition and saw Abyssinia as a low-hanging fruit. Only visionaries like Gilippo dared to dream of something greater.\n\n"Mister Gappi?" King Gomez asked. "Is everything alright?"\nThe griffon let out an exasperated sigh. "Yes, yes, just got lost in thought." He spoke Abyssinian with remarkable fluency for a griffon. "What is your response to this formal protest from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? If these new taxes your government has introduced aren't repealed, then I'm afraid Wingbardy will have no choice but to impose countermeasures, as these are a direct violation Treaty of Katren."\n"And your seizure of Katren was a violation of the previous treaty," Morticia hissed.\n"Calm down, Tish, I've got this," Gomez said to her, then turned to look at the griffon. "Our response is...""

 abyssinia.62.t:0 "Abyssinian Protectionism"
 abyssinia.62.d:0 "Gilippo Gappi, a diplomat dedicated to Zebrican affairs, is reporting that he has failed to convince the Abyssinian government to repeal their recently imposed taxes on foreign companies. These are detrimental to Wingbardian business interests, especially those of Talonieli, who will likely have to scale down their operations in Abyssinia. Many griffons are demanding [Root.GetLeader] to impose sanctions on Abyssinia, as these taxes are a direct violation of the Treaty of Katren, which guaranteed tax exemptions for Wingbardian companies. If Abyssinia continues its uncooperative stance, it is possible more harsh actions might need to be taken."

 abyssinia.63.t:0 "Regaining What Was Lost"
 abyssinia.63.d:0 ""I presume you know the agenda of today's meeting?" Dejen asked from Gomez while shuffling some papers in his paws.\n\nThe King slouched on his throne. "Yes, yes, restoring the Kingdom's lost wealth. I still can't believe I managed to lose everything my ancestors had collected over the centuries. There were many irreplacable family heirlooms the treasury."\n"Like the Misfortune Malachite?"\nGomez frowned.\n"You should stop thinking so much about the past, as you cannot go back and change things. We have no option but to cope with what happened and try to build a better tomorrow."\nTension dissipated from Gomez's face. "Well said. So, how do we stop being as poor as beggars?"\n"Unlike beggars, we have multiple options at our disposal. The first and most obvious one is to temporarily raise taxes so income surpasses expenditure. Obviously, this could lead to minor unrest and political wrestling. Another option is to contact a foreign bank and try to negotiate a favourable long-term loan. We'll have to pay it back eventually, but at least we will not be crippled by lack of funds. The third option is to order the State Bank of Abyssinia to produce additional currency straight into the treasury. This would, however, result in a temporary sharp decrease of the currency's value."\n"Hrm. So every option has a downside?"\n"Sometimes in life, there is no way to avoid negative consequences."\n"I sure have learned that. Give me a moment to think, will you?"\nDejen bowed respectfully. "Of course, your Majesty.""
