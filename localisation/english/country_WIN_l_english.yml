WIN_the_great_game:0 "The Great Game"
WIN_the_great_game_desc:0 "From the outside, the Legation Council stands as one, uniting the interests of the North Zebrican War's victors.

WIN_legation_profits_2_desc:0 "Winggarden may be lost to us, but there's no reason to be resentful about it. The Legation City is ready to share some of the profits with us. This will surely calm the most fiery spirits a bit, at least in the short term."

Their skills... vary, but the melting pot of ideas they bring to the table makes our military strong in its diversity, and always able to find new talent."
WIN_colthaginian_support:0 "Colthaginian Logistics"
WIN_colthaginian_support_desc:0 "The Colthaginian department of Legation Command has decided to take up the responsibility of keeping our forces supplied with all the non-military supplies needed by the garrison as well as non-combat military roles. We would be fools to say no to this offer."
WIN_wingbardian_arms:0 "Wingbardian Rifles"
WIN_wingbardian_arms_desc:0 "Wingbardian industry is shaping up to be the backbone of our military production, and a new shipment of weapons is coming in, along with new Wingbardian officers here to assert their military importance within the Legation."
WIN_chiropterran_expertise:0 "Chiropterran Expertise"
WIN_chiropterran_expertise_desc:0 "The Chiropterran General Staff has quickly proved itself to be one of the most skilled military entities on the continent of Zebrica, and their officers will make up the majority of our own command staff, bringing their expertise to our garrison forces."
WIN_nested_artillery:0 "Artillery Utilisation"
WIN_nested_artillery_desc:0 "Colthaginian and Wingbardian industrialists and military personnel have recently imported large amounts of heavy artillery and have begun equipping our garrison units with these weapons.

WIN_adapt_chemicals:0 "Lachrymator Agent Implementation"
WIN_adapt_chemicals_desc:0 "Now that Winggarden has settled into a state of "normalcy," the reality of the situation is setting in for many hippogriffs. And they have begun to fight back.

WIN_militarized_police_force_desc:0 "To keep further order within the city, the Legation Council has decided it is time to enlist some locals in defense of Winggarden.

These Hippogriffs will take oaths of loyalty to the mandate system, and shall serve to ensure Winggarden never returns to Hippogriffia. Hopefully."
WIN_special_command:0 "Special Weapons and Tactics Department"
WIN_special_command_desc:0 "To supplement our new police forces, Generals Pillar and Beep have put a suggestion before the council. A singular unit derived from the most loyal and experienced soldiers of the rest of our forces, equipped and supplied like the elite special forces of the rest of the world.

WIN_a_new_general_command_desc:0 "Now that our military command, as well as our rule over the city, have been solidified, we can afford to formalize our military into one cohesive whole.

WIN_local_arms_production:0 "Armament Production Optimisation"
WIN_local_arms_production_desc:0 "We can not afford to continuously bring in foreign weapons. Seriously. The budget can't fit it. In order to solve this, the Legation has sanctioned a local gunsmith open to working with us to open new industrial arms manufacturing facilities to supply the garrison's forces. This should hopefully keep our units supplied and ready to combat any insurgency."

WIN_air_fortifications:0 "Anti-Air Fortifications"
WIN_air_fortifications_desc:0 "Our air warfare capabilities will always be outshone by those of our benefactors, and even those of the Hippogriffs, so in order to defend our skies we must fight fire with ice.

WIN_a_forum_for_peace_desc:0 "The prime architect of the Legation, Gilippo Gappi, sees this place as a "Forum of Peace", where the powers involved can all gain something, and any creature who wants a chance to rise higher can do it here. The Chiropterrans and Colthaginians have... a different view. But since it was Gappi who formed this government, his vision will win out for now."
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy:0 "Stratify the Bureaucracy"
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The majority of the low-level bureaucrats that make Winggarden state run smoothly are from Colthage, and thus they have strong influence over the day to day running of the Legation. They have thus introduced a bill that officializes their control, establishing quotas for the national origin of certain officials, and ensuring they come out on top."
WIN_improve_trade_relations:0 "The Gappi Plan"
WIN_improve_trade_relations_desc:0 "Gappi has recently proposed another plan to the legation council, it will virtually abolish all trade tariffs within Winggarden, allowing goods and commerce to flow freely under the Legation's watchful eye. Considering the Legation's position, this will be of clear benefit to us, but it will also benefit the free trade interests of the Wingbardian representatives, increasing their influence over Legation policy."
WIN_balance_the_council:0 "Balance The Interests"
WIN_balance_the_council_desc:0 "Things have gotten a bit hectic down here in the legation, we're losing control, and our benefactors are starting to get suspicious of one another, thankfully we have one chance to make this right. Article 43b of the Winggarden Legation charter has a contingency where we can completely wipe clean our government and call on the benefactors to hash out a new one. But they won't stand for this more than once."
WIN_tighten_the_grip:0 "Tighten the Grip"
WIN_tighten_the_grip_desc:0 "Now that the Legation has formed itself into a "nation" and not just a motley crew of foreigners, we can begin to further exert our influence on this land. The Twelve Concessions are extremely vague when it comes to how much control we have, and we can use that to our advantage. Applying more pressure on Hippogrifia, we can gain more of an advantage over them, and further pressure them into decline."
WIN_an_intelligence_agency:0 "The Legation Security Service"
WIN_an_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "The Legation security service is a compound effort between all three of our benefactors. While run mainly by bats, this is a truly collaborative effort to crush all resistance to the Legation's governance through more secretive means. The Security Service's job is to ensure that our new status quo holds, and that this city thrives away from Hippogriff control."
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers:0 "The Hippogriff Volunteer Department"
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers_desc:0 "Now that our government has settled in, and the immediate threat of armed rebellion has passed, we have decided it is time to begin recruiting select locals into our police force and military. While foreigners will still make up the bulk of our forces, we can supplement them with hippogriffs just to make up the slack."

WIN_commission_a_fleet:0 "Commission the Fleet"
WIN_commission_a_fleet_desc:0 "We will never match Hippogriffia itself, even in its reduced state, but we can still build up a fleet to protect our shipping from other threats."
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations:0 "Submarine Anti-Partisan Operations"
WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations_desc:0 "Roughly half of the Legation's de jure territory lies beneath the water's surface. It's inhabitants are seaponies, the "other half" of the Hippogriffian realm and it has presented a... unique issue for our administration. None of the three species holding guard over the Legation can breathe underwater, meaning we are having to resort to... unique methods to halt resistance to our rule in this territory."
WIN_the_joint_marine_force:0 "The Winggarden Marine Corps"
WIN_the_joint_marine_force_desc:0 "We will never be on the same level as the natives when it comes to amphibious warfare adaptations. But hopefully, by training up a foreign funded marine brigade, we can come as close as possible to evening the playing field."
WIN_build_up_shipyards:0 "Fund the Shipyards"
WIN_build_up_shipyards_desc:0 "In order to maintain our fleet out of our small urban city, we will need to establish drydocks in the bay to repair vessels and construct new ones."

WIN_the_tram_system:0 "Modernise the Tram System"
WIN_the_tram_system_desc:0 "Wingarden already has an extensive tram system, even if it has not aged with grace. The combined resources of our benefactors, however, means that we will be able to court the services of some of the world's finest engineers, and in time we can make this tram system the most modern in the world!"
WIN_the_development_bank:0 "The Winggarden Development Fund"
WIN_the_development_bank_desc:0 "Despite our benefactors' differences, all are interested in seeing Winggarden prosper. Consolidating the resources we've acquired since the 12 concessions, we will be able to build up a new bank to specifically help with the development of the city."
WIN_colthaginian_companies:0 "Invite Colthaginian Companies"
WIN_colthaginian_companies_desc:0 "Our Colthaginian benefactors are an economic powerhouse. It would not take much to ensure that their conglomerates can install themselves in Winggarden, increasing their influence and our industrial capacity both."
WIN_AGWP_investments:0 "AGWP Contracts"
WIN_AGWP_investments_desc:0 "The Wingbardian delegate has been in contact with one of the premier Wingbardian petrochemical companies, and they've signalled their interest in establishing themselves in the city. Not only would it mean Winggarden becomes the center of a world-class oil refinery, it would also be a fine feather in representative Gappi's hat."
WIN_develop_the_arsenal:0 "The Winggarden Arsenal"
WIN_develop_the_arsenal_desc:0 "Prosperity begets envy, and if Winggarden is to ensure that the prosperity built up within her city limits remains in her hooves, she must be ready to defend it. None has questioned this particular point, and for once the three representatives put equal enthusiasm into arranging for Winggarden's military industrial complex to grow."
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes:0 "Chiropterran Military Towns"
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes_desc:0 "Ocean Spray has argued quite fervently for the adoption of the Chiropterran system of military towns. While it would put certain quarters of the city beyond the other representatives' grasp, it would also, undoubtedly, help to fortify Winggarden in case of an attack."
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies:0 "Nationalise Hippogriff Companies"
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies_desc:0 "The local Hippogriff companies are a security risk, one that must be dealt with. While they've by and large played by the rules set forth, they are obvious vectors for the Hippogriffs to attempt to reassert themselves, or at least introduce spies into the city. It'll cause a stir, but they should be nationalized and placed under our control."
WIN_import_experts:0 "Invite Financial Experts"
WIN_import_experts_desc:0 "Many times, the sound advice of financial experts will get hampered by political necessity, but thankfully Winggarden offers more freedom than that. Our far-reaching control along with our sound business laws mean that economic reforms will not only be tolerable, but welcome. It's time we let the world's top financial minds know this."
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill:0 "The City On A Hill"
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill_desc:0 "Winggarden has become something rarely seen before in this world; a place where competition can reign supreme. Whether competition between our representatives, benefactors, companies or citizens, we all stand tall upon the hill where we built our paradise, and all will scratch and claw their way up that hill for a chance to partake in the prosperity that is the rightful reward of the victors." 
WIN_develop_fuel_stores:0 "The Legation Municipal Fuel Reserve"
WIN_develop_fuel_stores_desc:0 "The ever belligerent Ocean Spray has lobbied quite fervently for the creation of a municipal fuel reserve, arguing that if we are cut off from our trade partners we must be able to rely on our own fuel reserves. This 'dagger to our necks' must be addressed he insists, and of course the fact that it will advance his own goals is surely merely a coincidence." 
WIN_develop_steel_milling:0 "Develop Steel Milling"
WIN_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "The number one metal of the modern world is not gold or silver, but steel, and Winggarden has the potential to master this metal as well as well. Negotiations with foreign steel companies have already begun, and we have half a dozen companies eagerly bidding for place in the new industrial park designated for the purpose."
WIN_high_rises:0 "The Mile High Club"
WIN_high_rises_desc:0 "Winggarden is a small place, and real estate is hard to come by. The solution is simple; build upwards! Winggarden will become a mountain range of high-rises reaching up against the sky, and in this we will become the very image of the future city, even if we have to expropriate some locals' residences to achieve it."

WIN_the_legaiton_secured:0 "The Free City"
WIN_the_legaiton_secured_desc:0 "The great game of dominance in Winggarden has come to an end not with a bang, but by grinding to a halt. The Legation bureaucracy has crystallized to the point where neither player can subvert it, and Winggarden faces a future that neither of its founders could envision: a future of freedom."
WIN_the_biggest_port:0 "The Staple Port Of Zebrica"
WIN_the_biggest_port_desc:0 "Winggarden can be the gateway to Zebrica, if she only has the space for it. With further expansions of the harbor, our tonnage capacity will be unrivalled. The future looks bright, after all, and we need to prepare for it."
WIN_underwater_hotels:0 "Vertical Development"
WIN_underwater_hotels_desc:0 "Space remains a luxury in our city, and we have already built upwards. It is time to learn from the Hippogriffs and build downwards, into the ocean. Imagine! Hotels and restaurants - an entire tourist complex - situated under the waves, with the beautiful bottom of the sea for a view!"
WIN_naval_aviation_department:0 "The Winggarden Naval Aviation Department"
WIN_naval_aviation_department_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to secure the trading lanes for both us and for our trading partners, Winggarden has acquired a large amount of long distance naval bombers which will let us protect and intervene along the lanes wherever needed."
WIN_legation_mechanisation:0 "Legation Mechanisation"
WIN_legation_mechanisation_desc:0 "The most technologically advanced city in the world should have a military to match. Instead of slogging along by hoof, our soldiers will be able to arrive on the scene in moments, mounted in armored vehicles and striking faster than their enemies can react."
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces:0 "Unite the Volunteer Departments"
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces_desc:0 "Thanks to the legates' bickering, the myriad foreign volunteers have been organized in different, sometimes competing formations. It's a mess, but thankfully we are now in a position where we can try to unravel this twisty knot."
WIN_expand_the_council:0 "Open Up the Council"
WIN_expand_the_council_desc:0 "With the great game no longer being carried out in the halls of power, the time has come to open them to the Hippogriffs as well. There's no point in alienating the local elites, not when they are our neighbors and competitors."
WIN_permit_gatherings:0 "Permit Public Gatherings"
WIN_permit_gatherings_desc:0 "Instability and resentment is bad for business, and this suppression of the marketplace of ideas has gone on for long enough. Let the people have their voice, otherwise they will be out protesting in the streets."
WIN_council_of_corportations:0 "The Corporate Council"
WIN_council_of_corportations_desc:0 "Winggarden exists as a place for commerce and ambition, and in order to ensure these values never are threatened, we will ensure that the major economic powerhouses of our city are well represented in the government."
WIN_allow_political_parties:0 "Into The Shadows"
WIN_allow_political_parties_desc:0 "The power of the legates isn't going anywhere, it's just changing form. The recent unrest meant that reform was needed, but the power is simply moving into the shadows, from which Winggarden's original purpose can still be carried out, only in a more palatable form."
WIN_renegotiate_concessions:0 "Negotiate With the Hippogriffs"
WIN_renegotiate_concessions_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is still resenting the loss of Winggarden. This resentment will not magically vanish, but maybe we can offer them a deal? Giving them a seat a the table and a share in the profits will alleviate their economic woes, and if they in return acknowledge us... well it's the best deal possible, isn't it?"
WIN_further_urban_development:0 "Sky High"
WIN_further_urban_development_desc:0 "We're building higher and higher, and it seems like every day the tallest building in the city changes. This is our pride and joy, our finest monument to Winggarden's prosperity. Redirect plane traffic, reform the building codes to ensure proper safety, restrict personal flight to the boulevards, for Winggarden is growing!"
WIN_rubber_development:0 "The Winggarden Rubber Plant"
WIN_rubber_development_desc:0 "One of Winggarden's strengths is its openness to foreign business, and the newfound stability has brought investors both new and old to our shores. Among these, rubber is one of the hot new commodities. If Wingarden corners the market on synthetic rubber, we will have a product everyone will need."
WIN_legation_CAS:0 "The Legation Bomber Fleet"
WIN_legation_CAS_desc:0 "Winggarden's metropolitan landscape makes it tricky for airplanes to find their targets in case of an attack, but more easily manouvered light bombers or attack planes can manouvre around the skyscrapers if need be, and the boulevards can serve as runways if needed."
WIN_rocketry_development:0 "Changeling Ingenuity"
WIN_rocketry_development_desc:0 "We are a city that welcomes the ambitious, and the Changelings are no exception. It's strange how few are giving them a chance, but their loss is our gain, especially when some of these changeling expatriates turn out to be rocket scientists."
WIN_just_like_pegas:0 "The Las Pegasus Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_pegas_desc:0 "Winggarden is a centre of commerce, but its entertainment industry is booming as well. The trade will flow either way, so maybe it would behoove us to focus on making sure that all of north Zebrica knows that Winggarden is the place to come to for a good time?"
WIN_just_like_skyfall:0 "The Skyfall Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_skyfall_desc:0 "Any merchant worth their salt knows how Skyfall has become a cliché when speaking of a successful business centre. We can at least aim to spare Zebrica from the constant nattering about Skyfall, and we shall do so by supplanting it as the heart of international commerce across north Zebrica."
WIN_the_atomic_age:0 "The Age Of the Atom"
WIN_the_atomic_age_desc:0 "The new frontier of scientific development is in the atom, and the applications for this new technology are countless. And after all, what is Winggarden if not a haven for the experimental and the modern? Time to start experimenting on atomic level as well."

WIN_the_wingbardian_takeover:0 "Unfortunate Circumstances"
WIN_the_wingbardian_takeover_desc:0 "The Great Project has collapsed, it now falls to the remains of the Wingbardian Legation to salvage what it can from the city, and adapt a new plan to fit their old mission. For King and Country, it shall be done."
WIN_advisors_not_rulers:0 "Advisors, Not Rulers"
WIN_advisors_not_rulers_desc:0 "The Hippogriffs will never accept Wingbardian rule, and without Chiropterran muscle, we can never keep true control as kings in all but name. So we need to find a willing pawn, someone who can run the state for the Legation. Perhaps a local fascist will do?"
WIN_fascist_propaganda:0 "The Action"
WIN_fascist_propaganda_desc:0 "Winggarden is still in a state of chaos, the citizens are looking for something to turn to, an idea to grasp onto. "The Action", the newspaper publication of Silversliver's party shall be spread all across the city by Wingbardian agents, the people must know the truths of the world."
WIN_hippogriff_blackshirts:0 "The Winggarden Blackwings"
WIN_hippogriff_blackshirts_desc:0 "While the NUHF has maintained an unofficial paramilitary force for a while, it is time to officialize it. The new Blackwings, named after their brother in organization in Wingbardy, shall be a shining beacon of culture, strength, and power for all Hippogriffs to look up to."
WIN_the_hippogriff_duce:0 "The Wingsington Square Rally"
WIN_the_hippogriff_duce_desc:0 "It is time for the great Zephyr Silversliver to make his entrance into the public eye, many already know of him, but it is time for an official grand appearance. Carefully stagemanaged to make him appear as mighty as possible, he is the peak of Fascist culture, and he wishes for all Hippogriffs to rally around him and have unity in purpose and belief."
WIN_find_willing_corporate_collaborators:0 "Corporate Collaboration"
WIN_find_willing_corporate_collaborators_desc:0 "Our position is still fragile, but we still have one thing to use. The old Legation treasury along with Wingbardian funding. So, we must bring in allies, there are many companies across Hippogriffia who may be open to working with us if it makes them a profit. Right now we don't care if they are true fascists or not, we need support and we need prosperity."
WIN_wingbardian_investment:0 "Wingbardian Investment"
WIN_wingbardian_investment_desc:0 "Many corporations from Wingbardy have shown an interest in setting up shop in Winggarden, with some funding we can secure a new supply line for goods for our administration, and try and keep ourselves afloat in a hostile land."
WIN_utilise_the_SIM:0 "SIM Information Network"
WIN_utilise_the_SIM_desc:0 "The Wingbardian Intelligence service still has a strong presence in Winggarden, and are ready to strike out at our enemies from the shadows. We just need to give them a target first."
WIN_help_rebuild:0 "Hearts And Minds"
WIN_help_rebuild_desc:0 "The fall of the legation was marred with violence and destruction from both the occupying powers and the citizens of Winggarden. This can not continue, we shall feed and clothe the people to show them that the fascists are nothing to fear. Our Wingbardian comrades are here to help, and the NUHF are the new protectors of the city. All the other politicians lied to you, Zephyr will not."
WIN_the_torch_of_fascism:0 "The Torch Of Fascism In Zebrica"
WIN_the_torch_of_fascism_desc:0 "It is time now to march, not against the occupiers of Winggarden, but with our saviors from Wingbardy. It is them who brought the light of Fascism to Hippogriffia, but they can not do the job for us any longer. They are passing us the torch now, the beautiful light of pure Fascist ideals, and Zephyr Silversliver will bear that torch, and he shall lead Hippogriffia into a bright Fascist future."

WIN_fascism_rising:0 "Hail To The Commandant"
WIN_fascism_rising_desc:0 "Silversliver delivered us from the chaos of the legation collapse into a bright new fascist future. All hail the commandant! May he continue to guide us forward, free of the shackles of tradition!"
WIN_repair_the_shipyards:0 "Revitalise The Winggardian Shipyards"
WIN_repair_the_shipyards_desc:0 "If we are to match the anti-fascist enemy, then we will need to battle them on the high seas. Our patrons can only do so much to help us, a pure Hippogriffian fleet must challenge the monarchists at sea, the domain of half of our citizens."
WIN_integrate_the_seadwellers:0 "Submarine Mining Initiative"
WIN_integrate_the_seadwellers_desc:0 "The vast undersea has an abundance of natural resources that could be used to serve the national interest. Combining our natural affinity for the ocean with new drilling technology, we can extract from the deep what we need to throw back the reactionary monarchists."
WIN_repair_the_fleet:0 "Repurpose The Legation Fleet"
WIN_repair_the_fleet_desc:0 "The Legation Fleet was captured after the brief battle for the metropolis. It will be key to our eventual control of the oceans surrounding Hippogriffia, and the start of something much greater."
WIN_underwater_fascism:0 "The Association Of Sequestrian Fascists"
WIN_underwater_fascism_desc:0 "The seaponies are tired of living under the crushing pressure of tradition, and are flocking to our movement in record numbers. We should send the Commandant down to Seaquestria, in seapony form, to organize this undersea fascist vanguard."
WIN_request_the_islands:0 "Request The Six Isles"
WIN_request_the_islands_desc:0 "Now that we have brought the glory of fascism to Winggarden, there is no need for Wingbardy to administer the Six Isles directly. Reclaiming these isles, even if it is through diplomacy rather than violence, would stoke the fervour of our people and lend legitimacy to our government."
WIN_fascist_corporatism:0 "The Nine Corporations"
WIN_fascist_corporatism_desc:0 "Corporatism is the most advanced, the most efficient, the most revolutionary system of economics ever devised. We will implement this system in Winggarden, sanctioning nine corporations of employers and workers to represent and govern the major sectors of our economy."
WIN_class_reconciliation:0 "Class Reconciliation"
WIN_class_reconciliation_desc:0 "Every true fascist knows that the passion of your soul determines your worth, not your place in some materialistic production chain! We will promote collaboration and cooperation between the classes, with all directing their energies towards the most fervent objects of their passions, rather than towards sterile class interest."
WIN_rebuilding_the_city:0 "The City Of Springs And Gardens"
WIN_rebuilding_the_city_desc:0 "Our city shall be one of culture and creation, a perfect Fascist city in all regards. The architecture shall fuse art, culture, and the warrior spirit of our people into every brick layed and every wall built. For if one does not live their life surrounded by fascism, then they have failed spiritually."
WIN_scaling_taxation:0 "From Each For All"
WIN_scaling_taxation_desc:0 "The old tax system of the legation completely excluded the financial classes from the burdens of taxation in the service of commercial interests. While we seek to form our own relation with the corporations, we do need the revenue for our own purposes. So, a new scaling income tax shall be put in place to ensure everyone gives all they can to support the nation."
WIN_embrace_syndicalist_militarism:0 "The Death Of Bourgeoise Decadence"
WIN_embrace_syndicalist_militarism_desc:0 "The rich hoard everything they can in their ivory towers while leaving the poor to die in the dirt. While we are glad to ensure a right to wealth, the decadence of the wealthy, their greed and perversion of the fascist spirit, cannot go on. They do nothing with their wealth besides earn more wealth, so we shall do something better with it."
WIN_empower_the_intellectuals:0 "Empower The Intellectual, Unshackle The Poet"
WIN_empower_the_intellectuals_desc:0 "The theorists of society are the most revered class of all. For without them, we would still be living in the muck and dust of the darkest ages. Without their revolutionary ideas, fascism would have never come to be. We would still be chained down in the ancient customs of centuries long past. For this, we must let them continue their eternal work."
WIN_the_superior_individuals:0 "The Tenth Corporation"
WIN_the_superior_individuals_desc:0 "Commandant Silversliver has proposed another brilliant idea: the establishment of a symbolic Tenth Corporation, to represent the poets, the artists, the visionaries, the dreamers, in short the superior people whom our movement exists for."
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_intellect:0 "Cogito Ergo Sum"
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_intellect_desc:0 "The researcher, the intellectual, and wise griff. These are those who advance society. Those who create the technology of tomorrow, and push civilization forward. The great 10th Corporation shall serve foremost to represent the interests of these great researchers, ensuring they have the funding to persue any and all research they may wish to conduct."
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_art:0 "To Feel Is To Understand"
WIN_embrace_the_perfection_of_art_desc:0 "Art and music gives meaning to life. Without these mediums of pleasure to enjoy, what point is there to living? The Artists have for thousands of years given purpose to the lives of the hippogriffs. For this service, and their continued prosperity, we grant them dominion over the 10th Corporation."
WIN_the_grand_council:0 "The Grand Council Of Fascism"
WIN_the_grand_council_desc:0 "The Grand Council of Fascism shall be the beating heart of our nation state. Those who are educated in the wise ways of fascist theory and know how to apply it to the state at large."
WIN_embrace_the_future:0 "The Futurist Manifesto"
WIN_embrace_the_future_desc:0 "We are today moving beyond the past faster than we ever have before. The pace of the advancement of society is increasing exponentially, and fascism will only serve to accelerate this evolution. Who knows what the world will look like in 50 to 100 years. Or rather, we know one thing at least. It shall be a fascist world. Oh and no pasta."
WIN_the_seven_rectors:0 "The Seven Rectors"
WIN_the_seven_rectors_desc:0 "The seven rectors govern the seven great schools of art, and are given authority to promote the ideals of fascism within their respective fields so that the innovation of the fascist nation will never die."
WIN_revolt_against_tradition:0 "Revolt Against Tradition"
WIN_revolt_against_tradition_desc:0 "The traditions of the past are mere chains upon our spirit! The monarchy and institutions like it have held the nation back for far too long. We cannot be held back by notions of morality and subjective "good" and "evil." The fascist state has no such use for these outdated concepts."
WIN_the_warrior_spirit:0 "The Warrior Spirit Of Aviandom"
WIN_the_warrior_spirit_desc:0 "As hippogriffs, we are brothers to the great warriors of Griffonia, going all the way back to the great Arantigos. Legend says, one of his generals even took refuge in far away Hippogriffia and taught us ways of war. This spirit lives strong within us, and it forms the core of who we are."
WIN_the_poet_inside:0 "The Poeticism Of Equinity"
WIN_the_poet_inside_desc:0 "Across the world, equines are the greatest creators. And we, as hippogriffs share in this power to craft and create with our minds and souls. It is said in legend by some mystics that a primordial pony spirit gave up her divinity to grant hippogriffs this great power. We alone can carry this mantle, and we fascists are ready to rise to the task."
WIN_the_avian_ideal:0 "The Perfection Of The Equino-Avianic Form"
WIN_the_avian_ideal_desc:0 "We are the perfect fusion of equine and avian. The hippogriff is the creature most spiritually ready to accept the truth of fascism, and it is our duty and calling to spread it to all of our brothers and sisters."
WIN_exalt_violence:0 "Exalt Violence"
WIN_exalt_violence_desc:0 "What better way is there to live life than violently? Free from the constraints of failed moral codes and ancient standards of behavior. We are a free people! And we shall not be chained by failed despots and lecherous cretins, we shall live as we were meant to!"
WIN_fascism_is_revolutionary:0 "The Revolutionary Fascist Ideal"
WIN_fascism_is_revolutionary_desc:0 "We are the heralds of the new world order. A more free world where the culture of fascism means that every creature can live better than their parents did. A world constantly marching proudly into the future has always been, and will always be, the end goal."

### Events ###
legation.1.t:0 "The Birth Of The Legation City"
legation.1.d:0 "As he lit up a cigar and leaned back in his comfy chair, Gilippo Gappi could hardly keep himself from smiling. Puffs of smoke drifted upward, and the griffon mentally pat himself on the shoulder.\n\nHe deserved it, after all. His ingenious idea, Winggarden, an international city of unlimited potential, his legacy to future generations, had actually come to fruition.\n\nHe had had to call in all the favours he’d accumulated over the years so to have a seat at the negotiating table, that was true, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs back in Karthin had been timid at first to the idea. Those bureaucrats saw little to be gained from a continued involvement in Zebrica. Unless it was Abyssinia, of course.\n\nGappi scoffed contemptuously. Why waste energy and blood in bringing an arid land to heel when Aris was just there, bloodily beaten and ripe for the taking? The fame that Winggarden was about to shower him with would outshine anything else, and the wealth extracted from it would silence all the nay-sayers.\n\nGlancing down upon his desk, his wandering eyes caught the two dossiers laying there. He realized he shouldn’t have done so, as his good mood waned a bit. Sharing his project with somegriff else had not seemed like anything to worry about at first, but now? That might prove a problem in the long run. He would need to tread carefully from now on, but Gappi was confident. With some luck and skill, the Legation could work.\n\nAfter all, there would doubtlessly be plenty of money for all those involved. And if experience had taught him anything, was that money was an excellent incentive to keep things stable.\n\nShaking his head, Gappi went back to enjoying his expensive Sicameon-made cigar. He refused to let those thoughts ruin his perfectly good mood; instead, the griffon focused his attention to the promising future that waited for him.\n\nHe had already received overtures from many Wingbardian companies, so that they could tap into the novel market that was the Legation City.\n\nAnd, as the soon-to-be Legate, he could afford himself to be choosy."
legation.1.a:0 "Let the money flow!"

legation.2.t:0 "The Start Of Something Beautiful"
legation.2.d:0 ""Absolutely no! I don’t care how sensible you may believe it is, I will not allow it. And that’s the end of it!" Zillqat Zaladid snarled, eyes narrowed in fury. He was standing now with both hooves planted firmly upon the roundtable. If Sonar Beep was to take a guess from the way his eyebrow kept on twitching, the Colthaginian was on the brink of smashing it.\n\nSo, she wisely decided to remain silent, waiting for Zaladid’s anger to subside. Eventually, it worked. The stallion sat back in his chair with a tired sigh and took another sip from his teacup.\n\n"He’s right, you know," Gevese said. The griffon took one last pull from his cigarette before smothering it in an ashtray.\n\n"It’s not that I don’t see the necessity of it, mind you. Unlike dear Zaladin here, I find it quite reasonable. In fact, I would be in favour to it." He feigned not to notice the ugly look thrown his way by the Colthaginian. "However, I’m afraid that a centralized command it’s not applicable at the moment. My own troops will refuse following a foreigner, no matter what the chain of command says. Especially after last week."\n\nDespite her disappointment, Sonar Beep made an effort to nod solemnly. It had been a long shot anyway. There was little hope in trying to implement a system of command and control similar to the Chiropterran one, no matter how much Ocean Spray insisted. The military forces in the city were simply too heterogenous and would not accept being placed under a unified command.\n\nEspecially Ocean Spray’s.\n\n"I understand the issue. If this is your final answer, then I will not push it any further," Sonar Beep said. Then, she smiled politely. "I do however propose a compromise. A more decentralized structure, combined with a joint council of all high-ranking military personnel. It would be flexible, and a good foundation for further improvement."\n\nHer Colthaginian and Wingbardian colleague seemed to mull over the proposition for a bit. Gevese was the first to answer, "That is acceptable. Just please, make sure that legate of yours doesn’t order us to shell protesters with mortars again. I nearly got a mutiny on my claws.""
legation.2.a:0 "It's a start..."

legation.3.t:0 "A Night Out"
legation.3.d:0 "Zillquat took another long sip from his blonde beer, before loudly putting it back down with a smack. How that poor glass has survived that much mistreatment for the last two hours, none could be really sure.\n\n"So, no shit, there we were," Zillquat continued, eyes bright with elation, "cut off from the main body, short on ammunition, and with the bloody Coltvans closing in from all sides. Quite the situation, eh? And if that wasn’t enough, our commanding officer had decided to be a complete moron and order a full-on frontal assault, because no matter the situation, it can always get worse."\n\nSonar Beep listened carefully, eyes wide, her own drink forgotten by her side. Not a million year she would have expected this, but there it was. The usually rough-mannered and reserved Colthaginian could get quite talkative after a drink or two. And by the Nightmare, he really didn’t want to stop anytime soon.\n\n"What did you do then?" Gevese asked, before taking another pull from his cigarette.\n\nZillquat smiled impishly. "Well, given the situation, I decided that drastic action was required. So, I bucked the idiot right in the head. And you’ll never guess, the little shit wet himself too!"\n\nRaucous laughter exploded around the table. Even the usually stone-faced Marble Pillar smiled, only for a brief moment though. "So anyway, that’s the story of how I got my first command. General Beep, it’s your turn."\n\n"Really? I thought it was Gevese’s."\n\n"Oh no," the griffon shook his head. "Mine is the embarrassing one, so we are leaving the best for last, as we’ve agreed."\n\nSonar Beep nodded. "I guess that’s fair." She took a long sip from her beverage as an encouragement, then she began. "Alright so, first of all, I want to point out that what I’m about to say it’s one-hundred percent true. Ask Marble Pillar here if you don’t believe me."\n\n"Oh dear Nightmare," the other thestral groaned, "you want to tell them about that time, don't you?" That gained the attention of every creature at the table.\n\nSadly, when the Winggarden General Staff woke up the next morning, half of them with a splitting headache, none could quite remember what the story was about. That proved to be not that big of an issue though; they would all agree afterward that, whatever the subject was, it had been probably hilarious."
legation.3.a:0 "Thank the Nightmare we're here!"

legation.4.t:0 "My Chemical Romance"
legation.4.d:0 "Deep within the tunnels below Winggarden, a group of military officers runs down a dimly lit hallway. Once one of the city's defensive redoubts against invasion, this tunnel network now serves as the paths by which the Legation military quickly moves about the city. And storming down corridor 3c, with papers in hoof, comes generals Marble Pillar and Sonar Beep. Inbound on room 14, also known as "The Nightmare Chamber," the office of Ocean Spray.\n\nEntering the room with a slam of the door, the figures already in the room turn to face them. Generals Zaladid and Gevese had already arrived and were speaking with Ocean Spray, after a couple of quick salutes the Chiropterrans place down the papers they'd been holding. Detailed maps of what was going on in the city. For the first time in the Legation's history, there was an organized mass protest on the streets. The shock of losing the war had kept the Hippogriffs tame for a while, but now they were back and angry.\n\nGeneral Pillar began, "They've occupied some of the main boulevards, the port, and the plaza around city hall. Gilippo is under siege in there and needs to be relieved. We've been preparing for this day for a while now, and we need to act fast. His guards can only hold out so long. I, for one, favor a strike operation to get him out, followed by a conventional surround tactic up Lunar Road and starving the protest out. They'll back down eventually. Zaladid then spoke up, "These protesters will be at our necks if we let them stay around any longer. We need to march a single column up the street, and they will part and let us through to Gappi. Or we will make them."\n\nThe commanders debated for a minute, not quite coming to a consensus before Ocean Spray himself lifted a hoof, "Gentlecreatures, the solution here is simple. A few days ago, I received a personal gift from my Lady Commander Emerald Light, which we can use to sort out this issue nice and quick." The commanders around Spray leaned in, intrigued what the Chiropterran representative had received. "We have been blessed by the Nightmare," Spray triumphantly declared, "with a shipment of methylphosphonofluoridate."\n\nThe generals stood for a moment, unsure what Ocean Spray meant. Reading the room, he explained, "Also known as sarin gas." At this, the room exploded, general Gevese spit out the coffee and began to curse wildly in his native tongue. Zaladid slammed his hoof on the desk and exclaimed, "Are you insane! Are you recommending we unleash a nerve agent on the population of the city! In the middle of the government district!" "By the Nightmare, I am general!" Spray responded. As their voices rose, a crack shot up in the air as general Sonar Beep fired a blank out of his pistol into the air. "Representative Spray! You are not a military officer, the use of sarin gas on the population will not be authorized. Though if I remember, you also received tear gas in that shipment. Something much more appropriate for the situation. We must act fast, I move we authorize the police to use this tear gas to disperse the protestors, and then we move in to get Gappi out of there. All in favor?"\n\nAll in the room besides Spray raised their hooves and claws. "Passed. Now let's get moving.""
legation.4.a:0 "Did somepony give him his pills for the day?"

legation.5.t:0 "On Patrol"
legation.5.d:0 "The two massive police officers - one griffon and one thestral - slowly strode down the street, both of them clad in heavy combat armor and carrying massive twelve milimeter rifles. Neither of them seemed overly encumbered by it either, and as they approached, hippogriffs, ponies and zebras all got out of the way in fear. The street market had been bustling, but now it was near empty, with only the occasional stall owners trying desperately to pack their wares up and step out of the way. One of the stall owners dropped a box of fruits, one of them rolling over the pavement and coming to a stop right in front of the leading griffon, who stopped and stared the shall owner down before picking up the orange.\n\n"Your papers, citizen?" the griffon asked, his voice rumbling inside the massive armor. The hippogriff backed away in fear at first, but the sight of the massive weapons made him dismiss any thought of fleeing, and he slowly walked behind the stall and took out his papers, which the thestral took and looked over, putting the orange back in the box.\n\n"These permits are due for renewal," the thestral informed him, the hippogriff stammering out an apology before being cut off. "Also, while you apply, make sure to ask for a AV-11 permit regarding fresh fruit, it was only signed into law a week ago, and may have missed it."\n\n"I-um... yes..." the Hippogriff began, trailing off.\n\n"Make sure to inform your fellow salescreatures of this as well," the griffon told him, "This market has done a lot of good for the local community, and it would be a shame to see it closed down. We will be patrolling here regularly, so do not hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. We are based at 5th Claw and Beak, and all relevant forms can be found there. Is there anything else you need, citizen?"\n\n"I don't think so?" the hippogriff didn't know what to think of this entire thing. The two officers simply nodded in response.\n\n"Good day, citizen," the thestral said as they began down the street again, leaving the market goers and stall owners to peek out from their hiding spots after the pair."
legation.5.a:0 "That was unexpected... but why the anti-tank rifles?"

legation.6.t:0 "Special Winggarden Assault Teams"
legation.6.d:0 ""You are the hammer that will crush all that stand before the legation authorities!" The thestral thundered as he walked back and forth in front of the black-clothed, heavily armored police officers, "Like a dagger, you will cut to the very heart of those who stand defiant, wreaking such havoc that-"\n\nBAP! his voice was cut off as the baton hit his leg and he gasped in pain, clutching his leg as he hobbled to the side, revealing the police chief that had come up behind him.\n\n"What he MEANT TO SAY..." the police chief said patiently, glaring at the police captain as he nursed his bruised leg, "Is that as part of our policing strategy, we aim to keep the regular officers for regular police work, and deploy the elite - you - for situations that exceed their capacities. Hostage situations, armed robberies, crazed mages, and so forth." The captain had recovered by now and came up to continue.\n\n"And to this end, you must be ready to wreak the ultimate violence upon all that stand before you. Give neither quarter nor mercy, for-"BAP!\n\n"He MEANS that you must above all else be disciplined and predictable in the field. Those who resist must be subdued, those who use lethal force must be neutralized, those who comply must be safe. There cannot be any doubt among the citizenry about what will lead to what. If they play along, they are safe, if they don't, they will be dealt with."\n\n"And above all else!" The captain began again, "Remember that you are instruments of vengeance-"BAP!\n\n"Of law and order..." the chief sighed. "When you are deployed, you are still police officers, and a successful deployment will not only deal with the issue at hoof, but it will also impress the population and show them just how capable the WPD is. This will inspire confidence, and confidence in the police will-"BAP! The captain had barely even opened his mouth this time. "-lead to trust. Each and every one here will have the highest standards placed on them for that reason. The eyes of the world will be upon you, and if we do well, we will be the vanguard of a new era. Good luck, officers.""
legation.6.a:0 "Yes ma'am!"

legation.7.t:0 "The Meeting"
legation.7.d:0 ""Very well, mares and gentlecolts. Listen up," Marble Pillar began, on hoof pointed on the map spread across the table. The most prominent members of the newly established Defence Council had been summoned there and, much to Marble Pillar satisfaction, they had answered it without hesitation.\n\n"Through various means, the Security Service managed to pinpoint the location of one of the most prominent resistance hubs in the city. The targets are various warehouses near the waterfront, and we suspect they’re currently being used to house imported weaponry."\n\n"What’s the enemy strength?" Gevese asked from his seat, eyes never leaving the map. "I mean numbers and equipment as well. Who are we dealing with?"\n\n"Sonar Beep?" Marble glanced toward her colleague.\n\n"Yes, of course. The group seem to be quite heterogenous; hippogriff nationalists, harmonists, communists, you name it. I believe some local libertarians as well. Total strength is around forty to fifty fighters, according to our most conservative estimates. Weaponry is varied, but they shouldn’t have any heavy weapons."\n\nFrom the opposite side of the table, Zaladid nodded solemnly. Then he spoke, "I propose a decisive assault. A couple of my Chargers teams should be more than enough to get inside, and the rest of our forces can follow shortly after. If we hit quickly, they won’t have the time to form a cohesive defence."\n\n"Agreed," Gevese said. He produced a pencil and proceeded to highlight some spots on the city map, all of them around the target. "From here and here, I can have clear lines of fire for my specialists. If any of them tries so much as peaking their ugly mug outside, they’ll get a crater through the head."\n\n"Boxed in like rats, uh?" Zaladid chuckled. "Fitting. I like your way of thinking."\n\n"Yes, but please keep in mind that our is a police action, not a military one," Sonar Beep pointed out quickly. "Our foremost concern should be to subdue them, if possible. I’m sure that precious intel can be extracted once they’re in my custody." Then, she grinned. "My colts from the S.W.A.T. will help in the operation and perform clearing actions together with your troops."\n\nThe Colthaginian nodded. "Fine by me." From nearby, Gevese nodded as well, then smiled. "I always wanted to see your department in action anyway. It’ll be interesting for sure."\n\n"Very well, enough of the chatter." Marble Pillar announced, glancing to each member of Defence Council in turn. "We have a target and a decided course of action. Now, let’s go. We’ve got a job to do.""
legation.7.a:0 "Hey! We're finally getting on!"

legation.8.t:0 "The Arrival Of The Volunteers"
legation.8.d:0 "Marble Pillar stood still, her face an unreadable mask; the only indication that she was in fact not a stone statue was the occasional movement from her eyes. Aside from that, she was utterly silent as the newly arrived Wingbardian contingent marched down the docks, the griffons coming to a perfectly-executed, synchronized stop before her, weapons by their side.\n\nHer glances were however directed not only to them, but also to the colleague beside her. Unlike Marble, Gevese had his beak split into a wide excited grin as he observed the assembled troops.\n\nOfficially, Marble Pillar was there to prove the ‘Chiropterran unwavering commitment to the security and stability of Winggarden’. Unofficially, however, Ocean Spray distrusted anypony that wasn’t his own (more or less) and had ordered both her and Sonar Beep to keep an eye close to the incoming volunteers, so to gauge their readiness as allies and, should the worst indeed come to pass, potential enemies. Much to her surprise, Gevese didn’t seem to mind of her being there.\n\nA cadre of officers from the contingent approached the two, stopping a few steps short and snapping to attention. Marble Pillar saluted back, and hers was a perfect one, born from years of experience. Gevese mimicked her gesture ... and then, to Pillar’s absolute horror, he hugged the leading officer of the group.\n\n"Giovanni! Good to see you and the others here," he exclaimed with evident delight. "It has been a long time, hasn’t it?"\n\nThe griffon officer grinned back. "Yessir, it has been. My congratulations on your promotion, by the way. Though many of the guys and gals still miss their old commander."\n\n"Promotion?" Gevese barked a laugh. "Oh, I wish it was that, trust me! Still, Winggarden is not too bad. Better than Abyssinia, that’s for sure."\n\nTilting his head toward the mare, he added, "May I present you my colleague, General Marble Pillar of the Chiropterran contingent. I’m confident you’ll show her the same courtesy you do to me."\n\n"Of course, sir. Ma’am," Giovanni said, snapping to attention a second time. Still a bit bewildered by the sudden disregard of protocol, Marble Pillar settled herself to a quick, stiff nod as an answer.\n\n"But enough with formalities. I’ll leave you and the lads some time to settle in. After that, how about we grab something to drink, and you tell me what you’ve been up to since Falcor?" His grin widened. "First round on me, of course."\n\nEvery creature present agreed quite enthusiastically on the idea. Of course, every creature aside from a very confused, and mildly infuriated, Marble Pillar."
legation.8.a:0 "Welcome to Winggarden lads!"

legation.9.t:0 "The Flycolts"
legation.9.d:0 ""Why is his bigger?"\n\nWithin the vast hangar, the question echoed much louder than anycreature would have liked. Sonar Beep immediately looked up from her paperclip in shock, a shade of pink on her face. Gevese, who had been conversing with some of the newly arrived pilots but a moment before, stopped dead in his track. He turned around, not quite believing what he had just heard.\n\nMarble Pillar was the first to break the uncomfortable silence, a disapproving frown on her face. "General Zillquat, would you please repeat that?" Somewhere behind, a few from the bomber crew snickered.\n\n"Of course I will," Zillquat replied. He raised an accusing hoof toward his Wingbardian colleague. "Why is his bigger than mine?" The chuckles from the aircrews present got a bit louder.\n\nGevese blinked, slowly. "I ... my apologies. I was just not expecting to hear that from you." The griffon shrugged and let out a soft chuckle. "Admittedly, I do hear such comments once in a while." Some distance away, Sonar Beep let out a soft wheeze, only to get silenced by a stern look from Pillar.\n\nUnfazed, Zillquat beckoned to the twin-engine bomber occupying most of the hangar. "I mean, look at this! I thought we’d all agreed that the Legation Air Force needed light aircrafts. Light, as in ‘not too expensive, with a modest profile and easy to maintain’, which Colthage could have easily provided at a reasonable price, by the way." He scowled. "And yet what we have here? Something that’s twice as big, probably consumes twice as much fuel too, and for what? So that some Wingbardian company can get a contract?"\n\nEventually, he finally realized the look every creature was giving him. "Well, what’s the matter? Did I say something wrong? It’s true though! He’s got a bigger-"\n\n"Zillquat!" Marble Pillar snapped, eyes narrowing to slits. "Shut up. Now." It was too late though, as Sonar Beep had already broken down into an uncontrollable fit of giggles. Meanwhile, if the grin slitting his beak was any indication, Gevese was clearly having way too much fun.\n\nSomewhere behind, one of the Wingbardian bomber pilots took the chance to slip by his Colthaginian colleague -a stallion of course- and quietly deliver the kind of predictable pun one could have seen coming from miles away. Unsurprisingly, he would not find that very amusing."

legation.10.d:0 "If the many years as a military griffon -and a diplomat too, even if a bit later- had taught Gappi anything, was that you should always get the measurement of the creatures you’re supposed to work with. Preferably as soon as possible. The results so far, however, were mixed.\n\n"Stop treating this like it’s your personal backyard!" Ocean Spray hissed from across the table. "We are now in hostile territory, and we must treat it as such! Do you truly think that Aris won’t try and take back Winggarden if they get the chance? A fight is coming, and we must be ready!"\n\nFrom the other side of the table, Azizelqart raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. "The memo hasn’t reached you yet, Legate? The war is over. What you are proposing right now is the equivalent of reigniting hostilities, and may I remind you that attracting capital is particularly difficult if the city becomes a warzone. We can gain much more through free trade than violence."\n\n"Capital? Trade?" The Chiropterran Legate rose from his seat, fangs bared, his face vivid with fury. "Are you insane?!"\n\n"Alright, gentlecreatures. I think this is quite enough. Constant discussion is clearly bringing us nowhere." Gappi quickly cut in the argument. He took a sip from his cup, savouring it. Equestrian tea was truly something special.\n\n"The problem I see right now," Gappi began, "is that each one of us has a different vision for Winggarden. In doing so however, we have forgotten one common element we all share; for all of us, you see, the Legation is but the steppingstone to something greater back to our respective homes."\n\n"I will not ask you why you’re here. Your reasons are your own, but please keep this in mind; the chance that has been granted us is unprecedented. Winggarden is a blank sheet, ready to be filled as we see fit. Now, we can squander this opportunity by constant arguing and backstabbing, or we can collaborate for the time being, so that the wealth gathered here will be the foundation of our respective careers."\n\nGappi lifted his teacup high as if for a toast, grinning to each in turn. "So, what do you believe is the best outcome?""

Except, of course, there was nothing normal about Article 43b. It was supposed to be an extrema ratio to be used, amongst other things, in case of insurrection or foreign meddling inside the Legation. Whatever plan any of the three had, all the careful work and manoeuvre done to gain an advantage over the others, it was thrown into complete jeopardy for the following months.\n\nAfter a brief -and quite heated- evening meeting, each Legate went back to their respective office to deal with new development in a different way.\n\nOcean Spray summoned Marble Pillar, Sonar Beep, and the rest of the Chiropterran officials, and then proceeded to scream at them for fifteen minutes; Azizelqart withdrew to his quarters in silence and buried himself in work until well after midnight; Gappi would attempt to enjoy a fine bottle of expensive red wine, only to barely drink half of it. Said bottle ended up smashed on the wall, thrown into a fit of rage uncharacteristic of the otherwise calm griffon.\n\nNone of them had any illusion on what was to come. If 43b had been called into action, it meant that the gloves were off now. The struggle for the control of Winggarden city would only become fiercer in the coming days. But that was in the future.\n\nFor now they rested, and drew up new plans."

"I would hardly call myself that. I’m simply assuring a bright future for Winggarden, for both ourselves and our benefactors."\n\n"And does that include bashing the Hippogriffs even more than we’ve already done?"\n\nAzizelqart shrugged. "That is such a hostile way of putting it. We’re merely abiding by the Twelve Concessions, precisely as they were written. Besides, I thought you said that the Legation City must be open to business. Well, there you are. Soon, riches will pour into the city coffins. And if the Hippogriffs do disagree, then they’re free to write a formal protest."\n\n"For some reason, I’m not so certain they’ll limit to that," Gappi pointed out.\n\n"So what if they don’t?" The sudden outburst came from Ocean Spray, rising from his seat to loom over the table. "Our security forces have been preparing for this moment. Winggarden’s defensive network is now a mighty bulwark, and we’ll use it to drown the Hippogriffs in a sea of blood! Let Aris come, for the forces of the Nightmare stand ready!"\n\nAzizelqart shot him a perplexed look at first, but then he nodded, although tentatively. "Ah ...yes, something like that. Though I doubt Aris is in any shape for an armed struggle; so, we can use these fortunate circumstances to apply more leverage and ... Gappi, why are you grinning?"\n\nThe griffon shook his head. "Oh please, don’t mind me. Go ahead. I’m just so proud of you two finally agreeing on something." Gappi mimicked wiping away a tear from his eyes. "Quite touching I must say."\n\nA look of horrified realization appeared on both Azizelqart and Ocean’s faces. They exchanged a glance to one another, a disgusted one at that."

Go into the next room and another officer will issue you your uniform and the initial gear. We’ll have a briefing in one hour where you’ll get your first assignment. Next!"\n\nWind nodded, stone-faced. She struggled to keep the disgust on her face from showing as she stepped out of the line of soon-to-be constables, just as another hippogriff stepped forward to take the oath, similarly to her.\n\nA newly-ironed uniform was pushed into her arms by a bored-looking bat, together with a belt and a short baton. No firearm though. Her blood boiled once her gaze fell upon the badge standing out on top of the bundle.\n\nWind Flow had never considered herself much of a patriot or a nationalist, and yet joining up the Volunteer Department -effectively helping the occupiers- left a bitter taste in her mouth.\n\nStill, what other choice did she seriously have? Commerce with the rest of Aris had effectively ceased once the Legation City had been established. And as cheaper goods begun to come in, her small shop had quickly gone under. Nearly forty years of family tradition weren’t worth much, not anymore at least.\n\nAt least the wage was good though; at least now she didn’t have to worry about what to put on the dinner table for her kids."

If you didn't trust them, you still had to carry out their orders, and the best thing an officer could do was to believe, and to trust.\n\nCaptain Galbo reminded himself of this again and again as the furious banging on the walls of his submarine began once more. Twelve years in the Wingbardian navy, several commendations and a chance to serve abroad in Zebrica, and yet this was where he had ended up?\n\n"Deploy the divers," he ordered quietly, and one of his officers moved as fast as she could over the by now padded floors and towards the diving lock, where she silently gave a signal to the six officers who had spent eight hours inside their wetsuits, waiting for this moment. Closing the hatch, they silently filled it with water from the ballast tanks so that it would not be noticed from the outside, and the officers all quietly put the masks over their faces, using the new Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatuses to be able to breathe even as the lock filled with water.\n\nWhen the airlock finally opened, his divers shot out of it as fast as their artificial fins could propel them, out at the seaponies that had clustered around the submarine to vandalize it, as they did every time. Not this time though, with their new gear, his officers would be almost as fast as the seaponies.\n\nOr they would be, if the seaponies had not come prepared with nets, and all his officers had for their rapid deployment was swimming straight into the nets like panicked fishes. With the seaponies descending on them, tearing off their fins and covering them in sea life, all Captain Galbo was left with was four humiliated officers coming back through the diving lock covered in starfishes and clams just as the knocking began again."

legation.15.d:0 "The public opening ceremony was a rather quick and modest affair, and that suited Azizelqart just fine. Operating behind the scenes and away from the public’s eye was something he had long since grown accustomed to back in Colthage; that’s where the real work was done, after all.\n\nConvincing the other two legates to support the complete renewal of the extensive Winggarden tram system had proven to be considerably easier than expected. Gappi had been enthusiastic about it, of course, and had immediately gone ahead to contact specialized engineers from Wingbardy to put to work on the project. Ocean Spray had, on the other hoof, grumbled for a bit, wondering why all that money wasn’t being used to strengthen the city defences, but had eventually come around after some heated discussion. He did however request for a couple of those rail lines to be reserved to military use only. Azizelqart didn’t know why he needed them and hardly cared, so long as he had the thestral’s approval.\n\nAnd so the project went ahead, with universal support no less. As for Azizelqart, he got exactly what he wanted. Such great work would not only prove an immediate benefit in drawing companies to Winggarden, but also act as a great showcase to the rest of the world. The Legation City was putting the scars of the war behind and finally opening back to business.\n\nOh, and Winggarden’s citizens could get a modern, functioning tram system for moving around; that one too."

Therefore, the zebra legate took care to visit the city’s docks and greet personally the incoming executives from his homeland. All in all, it was quite the friendly affair; Zahummid smiled, shook a couple of hooves, even cracked a joke or two.\n\nAfter that, he had them escorted to an already booked, five-stars hotel and parked for a couple of days there, so that they could enjoy the city and doing a bit of sightseeing. Or rather, Zahummid made sure to instruct the security detachment to steer his compatriots towards what he wanted them to see.\n\nThey would eat in the best restaurants, go shopping in the fanciest boutiques, and enjoy the kind of night-time entertainment that only a city as Winggarden could offer. Some would call it coaching; Zahummid preferred the term "readying the terrain".\n\nTo the surprise of nopony, the following meeting went exceedingly well; saying that the executives were enthusiastic about his proposition would have been a massive understatement. The Colthaginian consortiums would find a city welcoming them with open hooves. And the Legate would gain a great asset in the form of a considerable chunk of the local industry placed under Colthage’s control."

I guessed it from the colours, mostly."\n\nGappi smiled politely, then nodded. "Why, yes. You have quite the eye, I must admit. It is in fact from Saddle Arabia. A little treat I gave myself before the place decided to implode. I wasn’t aware you had such knowledge on art history."\n\n"A griffon ought to have a hobby or two," Gattei replied with a shrug. He chuckled. "Believe it or not, I dreamed of being an artist when I was younger. Took a few drawing lessons too back in Karthin. Instead, I found myself becoming "Beakolini’s oil guy", as some within the party are fond of calling me." He shook his head.\n\n"I’ll try and be honest with you, Legate Gappi," Gattei began, and the other griffon’s ears immediately perked up in interest. Up to that point they had been chatting amicably in his office, almost like two old friends, but that was over now. If Gattei was now addressing him by his title, it meant it was finally time to conduct business.\n\n"The AGWP has been finding itself in a bit of a pickle as of late. You see, the official party line is that Abyssinia has been utterly pacified. Unfortunately, this has proven again and again not to be the case. The government won’t send more troops there, for it would mean admitting that the Duce was wrong. On the other claw though, investors get understandably more and more agitated when they hear AGWP refineries have gotten repeatedly firebombed by enraged natives."\n\nGappi nodded solemnly, eyebrows furrowed. "That does sound quite bothersome."\n\n"Oh it is, I assure you. Sadly, the Duce seems to care little as long as the oil and gas keeps flowing, which might not be all that long. And when that happens, well, it will be my head on the chopping block."\n\n"I see. Well, what kind of proud patriot would I be if I were to leave a fellow countrygriff without help?"\n\nGattei let out a small chuckle. "Wingbardy is truly lucky of having you here, Legate Gappi. I suppose you already have a few ideas on how to help me that you’d like to discuss."\n\nA wide smile made its appearance of Gappi’s face. He quickly decided that calling for another bottle of red wine would be appropriate. He felt this was but the beginning of a most beautiful partnership."

And yet there he was, his mouth twitching into something that, after some squinting, could be called a smile. Or something similar, anyway.\n\nThe civil engineer by his side, a zebra mare, was still talking, occasionally pointing and waving her hoof around so to illustrate where the current project would take place. Ocean Spray had stopped listening to her a few minutes ago, thanks in no small part to the ruckus of labouring crews and roar of construction engines. Still, he made the effort to look interested and nod once in a while, but his mind was elsewhere.\n\nGappi and Azizelqart were both fools, he had long since decided. They were so busy running Winggarden like their personal project that they had forgotten the Hippogriff threat still out there. The military towns being built weren’t just a petty attempt to seize the best city quarters for his own, but they would act as mighty bulwarks against the incoming tide.\n\nNarrow streets that could function as chokepoints; reinforced concrete walls; flat rooftops sturdy enough to support the weight of heavier weapons. And of course, dedicated shrines for the Nightmare.\n\nThe military towns weren’t just a home away from home for the Chiropterrans, but veritable fortresses, a coiled trap ready to spring into action and bleed the invaders, or insurgents, dry.\n\nBesides, they were a fond reminder for Ocean Spray of where he had grown up.

Over the course of several weeks, the Legate’s cabinet would grow exponentially with new arrivals, something that did not escape his colleagues’ notice. Still, none of them did more than raising an eyebrow.\n\nGappi was too busy refining what he still considered "his" project, while Ocean Spray was ... well, he wasn’t really sure what the thestral was doing. Still, that was fine by him.\n\nAnd as Zahummid look across from his desk at the young and sharp minds gathered before him, he couldn’t help but smile proudly. They were all there because he had invited them. He hadn’t coaxed them with money or, at the very least, not just money. No, he was selling much more than that.\n\nHe was proposing to them an environment fully under their control, where their counsel and economic expertise would unshackle Winggarden’s full economic potential and propelled it to heights never seen before. All without pesky bureaucracy or boring politics getting in the way.\n\nHe had sold them an idea, and in exchange they would help him making it a reality."

legation.20.d:0 "As the great game continues between the three legates, tension has been building steadily throughout Winggarden. Winggarden has had no shortage of ambitious and dedicated creatures to fill the ranks beneath the legates, yet when the ones meant to be their superiors kept squabbling instead of governing, it wasn't long before people began to whisper. Calling it a conspiracy might be far-fetched, it was more like a series of changes throughout each of their organizations. Officials were no longer personally loyal to the legates, but instead their respective departments, and the big three's bickering became more and more of a hassle that needed to be dealt with. Thus, bit by bit, the great game found itself grinding to a halt, and by the time the legates realized what had happened it was too late.\n\nThere was no insurrection and no drama, just a sudden realization for all of them that their respective offices no longer supported them. And what were they meant to do? Call their respective homelands and say that theír subordinates weren't being obedient? At best, they'd get laughed at, at worst they'd cause an international incident as any foreign meddling would lead to the other parties intervening.\n\nThus, only a slow surrender was left for them, and they all handled it differently. Gappi slowly resigned himself to his fate and took a week off work. Ocean Spray barricaded himself in his office and and screamed through the window that they would all pay for this for several hours, until a squad of soldiers kicked the door down and forcibly escorted him home to cool off. In contrast though, Zahummid has not only taken the news well but seemed outright overjoyed, at least if his enthusiastic treating of the office to his personal liquor and cigarres was any indication.\n\nWith the legates either sidelined or persuaded, a new dawn is rising for Winggarden, a Winggarden that has managed to rise to stand on her own four legs!"

"You were saying?"\n\n"I... have been in contact with some of the hippogriff business leaders," the Wingbardian sighed, looking as though somecreature had sucked out his soul. "They have reacted well to the proposal, and they're planning to put forth a candidate to serve on the Legation Council."\n\n"Fantastic!" Azizelqart said enthusiastically, taking his mug of tea and sipping from it. "It's Golden Shore, isn't it?" he added as he was done, Gappi nodding.\n\n"It is, so thank Boreas for small blessings, at least."\n\n"What blessing is there even to be had here?!" Ocean Spray suddenly snapped, Azizelqart thinking to himself that the name was really fitting, considering how much the Chiropterran spat when he screamed. "Are you both utterly insane?! Why are we even entertaining this?! We should each be requesting aid from our homelands to crush this whole insurrection! But no, suddenly we are capitulating to the natives?!"\n\n"And I thought a military pony like you would understand the necessity of reform," Azizelqart commented airily. "Our purpose is to make sure money flows from Winggarden. If political liberalization helps in that, then why not?"\n\n"If giving control to the creatures we conquered helps us maintain it?" Ocean Spray asked. "Are you insane! Do you seriously think making a hippogriff a legate will aid in anything?"\n\n"We're not making one a legate, we're making one a president."

Our dilligence and our hard work is the bedrock of Winggarden, and we are building towards a future where every hippogriff will be the queen or king of this city, free and more prosperous than we ever could have imagined! I believe in a united and prosperous Winggarden: will you all continue to build with me?!" he asked, the crowd cheering enthusiastically.\n\nComing off the stage, he smiled widely as he shook claws with the people he just had addressed, listening idly to their concerns and giving them comforting little words. As he spotted the journalists with their cameras, he leaned in to one of the females that had come up to him, poking the little chick she was carrying with her in the stomach.\n\n"Well aren't you the cutest little thing?" he said merrily, "What can such a fine little boy be called, then?"\n\nAs the mother told him the name he made an affirmative noise and made sure the cameras caught him playing with the fuzzy little thing. "A fine name indeed. I hope we'll both be able to continue working for his future as well!" He said, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the hippogriffs around him.

With one claw raised, he put his hand on the law book and solemnly swore the presidential oath. He couldn't quite stop smiling, especially not as the sash was placed across his chest, and as he greeted the crowd, the smile was near blinding.\n\n"Today is a new day for Winggarden!" he said loudly, "My fellow Winggardians, how proud can we not all be this day?! Today, we have taken a great step towards making Winggarden, and Winggarden only, the shining city on the hill that we all know that she can be!"\n\nAs he spoke, Azizelqart sat in the background, smiling politely as he envisioned the string-pull on Golden Shore's back. Mentally, he reached out and imagined pulling it, and he had to stop his grin as Golden Shore's topic switched as if on a cue.\n\n"And I tell you all, my fellow Winggardians, that we are not done yet, and that we must continue to fight to ensure that the brave new world that has arisen in this city can remain an inspiration to all! Whatever was, we are Winggardians now, no less and no more, for what more could any creature ask for, than to be part of this great project? I swear to you, my fellow citizens, that I will not let Winggarden be threatened by anyone!

The city has elected its own leader and has moved to distance itself from its old. The new "president" of Winggarden, a hippogriff named Golden Shore, has contacted us with an offer of rapprochement.\n\nThe offer would let us access the Winggardian markets and enjoy the wealth that had built up there - something we sorely lack after recent events, yet in doing so we would not only give up our claim on the city, but we would also need to surrender the surrounding countryside to it. The area in question would serve as in part a buffer zone, but also to ensure Winggarden, and thus the wealth it would provide us, can continue to grow.\n\nThe city is still under Chiropterran, Wingbardian and Colthaginian control, and our prospects of retaking it by force is slim to say the least. This, at least, would give us something for all the pain, but can we truly give up the city?"

"You will not regret this, I can assure you of that!

That is their loss."\n\n"At least Golden Shore made the effort," Gilippo commented, "and the locals will remember that. They really do have good food here though," he admitted to Ocean Spray.

With enough time, patience and a plan that was as carefully laid out as it was utterly sociopathic, Winggarden had fallen under the control of the legionnaires and Chiropterra proper.\n\nAlmost immediately the sycophant scientist began to reestablish communications with the outside world; first to homeland and second to the Hippogriffians to make sure that they didn’t swoop in or flap gormlessly out of the sea in a vain attempt at restoring their long-lost honour. The Wingbardians and the Colthaginians then heard from Chiropterra that their concession was now under the control of the a thestral and his cronies. Of course both objected, but there was little they could do beyond speculate and gesticulate. After all, neither [CTH.GetNameDef] nor [WNG.GetNameDef] truly wanted a war with the mighty legions, try as they might to regain any semblance of control in the city that was supposed to repay three nations' worth of war debts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Ocean Spray simply sat in his office and watched as the remaining dissidents were rounded up and shot; knowing that the griffons and zebras would only know so much as what he said.

Unfortunately, events that have transpired over the past few days seem to indicate that the concession will soon fail to do even that.\n\nReports from stationed legionnaires tell of chaos and of an utter collapse of the Legation government, mostly as a result of political infighting. If it weren’t for the fact that Ocean Spray was running things for us there, the home administration could probably deny any involvement in such outright; unfortunately he was, and he had a reputation.\n\nIn any case the fate of the city remains uncertain as the Hippogriffians are currently too afraid to enter the territory over concerns of international retaliation. All the government can do now is wait and see who comes out on top; there’s little else that Chiropterra can do until then, save for monitoring Hippogriffia to ensure they don’t try anything stupid."

Here he was, running an entire statelet all by himself; having managed to perfectly execute a brutal takeover through various nefarious means.\n\nWhen the top brass read the reports of his success, most of them were as disgusted as they were impressed by his brutal efficiency. Taking over Winggarden had required a considerable amount of many things that he had slowly imported, by the sheer quantity of dangerous chemicals that Ocean Spray had used in his takeover was indication enough that he had well and truly dealt with any potential opposition.\n\nUnfortunately that means [Root.GetNameDef] will have to cover for his heinous crimes, but many are praising his takeover without the knowledge of the details.

Though his plan had been excellent, perhaps even his best work, there were always consequences for even the most well laid of schemes.\n\nSomething he had not been expecting was the sheer number of hippogriff volunteers that had signed up to help the slowly dwindling number of outsiders. In fact, by a count of the bodies floating in the sea, they made up approximately eighty percent of the corpses that were being disposed of. Not that it mattered of course, there was no escaping his reign over Winggarden and the continued support from the mainland was proving to be more than enough to keep their enemies at bay.\n\nHe scribbled one last approval on a request from his generals and stood up, walking over to his highrise window in order to take in the vista.\n\nJust outside of the hotel he had selected as his headquarters, a new division was being prepared to root out another resistance stronghold. Every creature amongst their ranks looked as though they had been through Tartarus and back, even though they had only served here for around a month or so.\n\nTaking a moment to stretch, the thestral simply smiled; revelling in his own success, if only for a moment in his busy schedule.

Nobody had been expecting to be found so soon, and nobody was prepared to fight. Even if they had been, the small collection of hippogriffs would have stood no chance; if not because of the use of tear gas, then because of the thirty-or-so Chiropterrans clad in gas masks that stormed the building and tore apart the occupants shortly afterwards.\n\nRaids like this were becoming a common occurrence, making absolutely certain that any potential resistance remained totally disorganised and without competent leadership. Needless to say that with the sharp decline of competent commanders, the precision involved in the stings was hardly necessary any more.\n\nProjections stipulated that another month or so of similar strikes would utterly wipe out any chance of unified resistance forming. Some legionnaires even whispered that such thoroughness as this was outright cruel, a rumour that was itself quickly cracked down upon. After all, you can’t be cruel to non-citizens and traitors; it’s simply what they deserve."

At first the veterans amongst the new arrivals were furious at such an attitude, but they soon came to realise why they were being looked down upon.\n\nThe few thousand soldiers that had been sent here initially as little more than a policing force had been through Tartarus and back. Many came down to greet their fellow chiropterrans using appropriate ranks, being cordial and so on; but there was an emptiness behind their eyes. Their uniforms were as much dirt as it they fabric and almost all of them had a gas mask haphazardly strung around their necks which had clearly seen heavy use. They were the veterans of whatever it was that Ocean Spray was putting them through, and it was miracle that they’d managed to survive this long without reinforcements.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the expeditionaries were copying the methods of the division that had first been here, making the most of their equipment and keeping everything necessary on hoof. Nobody knew exactly how a bunch of Imperial Rifles and Auxiliaries had survived this long, but they call all see that they were far more than just a bunch of rookies now. They were all legionnaires. They were bloody, broken, and beaten; they were the epitome of terror."

You see them ships over there?”\n\nThat was all it took for soldiers awaiting deployment to rush over to the railings and watch as their supply convoys gradually slipped into view.\n\nBy the time the ships arrived and docked, they received the helping hooves of a few hundred creatures that were glad of something else to do and eager to get themselves some half-decent rations. Every crate and package was eagerly torn open to be inspected by the troops, looking for their next meal and some new clothes.\n\nLuckily they had been sent both and more for their troubles. Massive stacks of food had been sent, with every other box containing weapons or other much needed equipment; and that was without mentioning the ‘FRAGILE’ boxes. Those were the really fun ones that were just for Ocean Spray and his schemes, which meant that they were likely as problematic as they were capable of problem solving.\n\nWhen the legionnaires saw that they were chock full of Venomous Agent X nerve gas, their theories were proven to be entirely correct. Not only that, but the cargo manifest had no record of such items; meaning that Ocean Spray had all the right friends in all the right places."

He couldn’t even get a look the soldier that had done it thanks to those awful gasmasks they wore seemingly all the time. Considering the use of tear gas, it made sense; but there were rumours about far worse chemicals being used. Maybe that was why his commander had just gone missing and never came back, though it could well have simply been a raid.\n\nThe hippogriff groaned in both an extant agony and continued on down the street to a particularly rough few blocks of the city. It was gritty and grimey, a district known for having a relatively mild crime problem before the legation; far too late did he realise that these run down blocks of flats where he was going to be living from now on.\n\nThe streets were comprised of short lines of hippogriffs and other ex-rebels, organised by the building that they lived in. The guards were all clad in masks that made them completely unintelligible, even speaking to each other in garbles and gestures that seemed to be only vaguely understood.\n\nHe recognised a few faces, mostly other seaponies that had been basically forced to retain a hippogriff form. After Ocean Spray had signed off on retaliatory oil spills for seapony families attempting the help the rebels, many had been forced to the surface. It was that or risk famine from failed seaweed crops; they hadn’t the resources or knowhow to get rid of the slicks. Even so, regular hippogriffs still made up a small majority of camp inmates.\n\nPut in a line with other prisoners, he was told that tomorrow he’d be starting work, making simple goods for the Chiropterrans. If he didn’t know any better, he’d say were the spawn of Tartarus itself."

Each of the papers was essentially a request for who to kill off first, so it wasn’t as though it really mattered which one he chose in the end. After all, Ocean Spray hardly needed to worry about the competence of his own troops and needed to worry even less about decapitating the various resistance groups with how things had been going.\n\nAll the same, his generals had asked him to pick one; much to his dismay. Something about efficiency and risk negation.\n\nThe thestral sighed and pulled his desk chair over to the window for the second time that day so that he could watch the well-oiled machine of the forward operating base work its magic in what had once been a city green below.\n\nThough he hadn’t actually taken the time to inspect the documents properly, he knew there was an option for each piece of paper. Something about monarchists, some right-leaning republicans and communists. Ocean Spray sighed and stood up, sauntering over to his desk to decide which paper to approve with his authority."

The thing slumped into the shoddy wooden chair set in place for defendants, receiving no lawyer and no consideration for his very obvious wounds.\n\n“You are hereby charged with treason, heresy and of heinous crimes against the state of Chiropterra. How do you plead?” The thestral - tasked with judging without even knowing the names of those that were being judged - demanded of the defendant.\n\nThe hippogriff was barely able to look up as he spoke, “N-not... Guilty...”\n\nHe rolled his eyes at that, “As you can provide no evidence to the contrary of these charges and have otherwise been testified against by,” Hard Gavel leaned over to inspect the documents in front of him for a moment, “Three different camp guards and one of your peers, I have no choice but to find you guilty and sentence you to death.”\n\nAs the guards sauntered over to drag the creature away and out of the back of the courtroom, the thestral sighed; annoyed for having to check the papers.\n\n“Next!”"

This wasn’t a night of raiding, nor was it a night of summary executions; at least not in the typical quantities. No, this was a night of slaughter - as all dissidents and heretics deserved.\n\nUnlike those in the internment camps however, these were the most barbarous of hippogriffs; those who could not be permitted to live even through a lifetime of labour and repentance.\n\nEven Ocean Spray lay awake in his bed that night, having given the order to finish the job once and for all. He could hear it all from his hotel room: the pleas, the gunfire cutting them off and howls of pain that followed. He could hear sub machine guns run dry as his legionnaires dumped entire magazines into their hapless enemies. When he got up for a drink he could see the incredible number of buddies floating in the sea steadily grow, every other hour.\n\nIf there was one thing that the thestral was envious of, it was their eternal sleep. After all, it wasn’t as though he would be getting any with all this constant noise; acclimatised to gunfire or otherwise. Most would have described it as trauma inducing and the legionnaires would have described it chilling at the very least, but Ocean Spray merely considered it a necessity."

Even the consistently billowing smoke from buildings that had been torched was no longer rising from fire, only from the ashes that had once sustained a blaze.\n\nOcean Spray had managed to put an end to the chaos in its entirety. There was no more resistance to shoot back at, just more prisoners to move into the internment districts.\n\nJust in front of the hotel he was staying in, the legionnaires had organised a small parade. Most were too exhausted to participate, but new arrivals and some of the more hardy soldiers made a point of celebrating their victory. After all, this was just the beginning of a new era for Chiropterra and for Hippogriffia; the former for further prosperity and the latter for imminent submission. There was no greater honour than to serve the homeland in such glorious and promising times as these.\n\nAnd yet, for all his success thus far, Ocean Spray simply sat on his bed and rested. His work was far from over and - though he was no warrior - the thestral needed time to rest. He had spent hours upon hours every single day in an attempt to plug the holes in what could have been a sinking ship, just so that a seemingly efficient plan could be fully realised.\n\nThere was still more to be done. There was always more to be done."

Finally, the door to the safe house opened, and the kirin stepped in. "Soothing Song, premier biologist of the University of Gamia, I can not believe we are meeting yet again, here in my city, and... and... why are you covered in blood?"\n\nLooking at the Kirin yet again, Coffee saw the faint red stain on the kirin's brown waistcoat and drew back. Blood never interested him, it could get in his fur, and that was a messy cleanup. It was the worst bodily fluid to try and bleach out.\n\n"Ah ah yes, Mr. Bean, Soothing Song simply had a bit of a run-in with a paid head collector on my way here." Coffee Bean groaned; he remembered how much the kirin's self-referential speech annoyed him. Then, something set in. "Wait, paid head collector... bounty hunters are looking for you? And you came to my safehouse?!" Coffee Bean grunted loudly and began shutting all the windows in the house, why did this need to happen to him? He specifically went to this meeting unarmed to try to court the kirin, and now he brought a serious threat of danger. Soothing Song spoke calmly, "No no Mr. Bean! Soothing Song dispatched them both already. It only took a pistol and some Plasmid powers."\n\nCoffee Bean settled down at this, and took his seat at the table in the center of the room, inviting Soothing Song to do the same. "Alright, alright that's good doctor. So you're still working on those plas-mid things? I remember that paper you showed me all those years ago, clever idea to use poison joke in that way." Soothing Song sat and nodded, "Yes Mr. Bean. But work has been slow for Soothing Song. The governments of the world are afraid of this research, what it could do to their societies. They ban Soothing Song from getting research money, and expel me. Thought Kiria would be better, Soothing Song was excited when the silence was lifted, thought research would be freed. Turned out to be more of the same."\n\nCoffee Bean nodded, "So, about these Plasmids. I'll give you all the cash you could ever need, but I'd like a demonstration if possible. To see how the magic happens." Coffee Bean looked down at a drawer in the table, "Let me just get you proof I'm not cheating you... hold on..." Coffee Bean looked back up to see the seat in front of him empty, looking around he couldn't see the kirin anywhere. Then, he heard a voice from behind him.\n\n"Tell me Mr. Bean. Have you ever wanted to be magical?" Coffee Bean, upon hearing this, took a small bag full of white powder out of his pocket, and inhaled it.

The security forces met him at the exit, and escorted him to a hurriedly makeshift podium to make the proclamation he'd drawn up on a napkin just moments prior. \n "Good citizens." He began, peering between the haze to try and read the smudged doodles on the now damp piece of paper. "The war's over. My guys tell me that we've got complete control over every major throughfare and like, yeah. It's all good." Staring over at the assembled crowd, he took a moment. This was one of those grand moments, something that would go down in history. He had to make a point. Besides, a groundbreaking speech would surely boost stock values, on top of today's breakthrough.\n"Today, we've shown that the market decides who wants what, and what it wants right now is to be free, as we all do. Freedom for all, equality for all and at market dictated price. Is there anything more pure, more wholesome in the world? I don't think so, mares and colts, I don't think so."

So when Crack Lightning was dragged before him, bruised and battered from his plane crash and the rough handling of his captors, Zephyr was wearing a huge grin. "You know I actually used to admire you, Crack."\n\n"What?" was Lightning's only response.\n"Yes, yes. The daring fighter ace, the devil-may-care attitude, it was quite inspiring. I even wrote an ode to your exploits. Not that it ever saw publication. When you returned from Wingbardy and started your pseudo-fascist wing of Aris First, I even thought that maybe you would be our Duce! But no. Instead you chose to champion reaction, embrace political opportunism. You even denied being a fascist!"\n\nDuring his monologue, Crack's eyes had focused on him and he'd blinked away at least some of his wooziness. "Oh shut up," he half-snarled, half-slurred, "You are a collaborating traitor and you don't know the first thing about fascism. I've met Beakolini, I've spoken to him. He doesn't care about your 'Equino-Avianic spirit' or your 'National Revolution,' he just wants a useful idiot to keep control of Aris for him."\n\nZephyr blinked. "You're not just a traitor, you're a clown. The Wingbardian Blackwings dye their wings to honour the victorious dead of the Falcorian War; they're meaningless on a hippogriff! All they say is that you love Wingbardy more than your own nation."\n\nZephyr scoffed, gestured for his griffs to drag him away. Crack was so parochial, so shortsighted. He was nothing like Beakolini. There was of course, no question as to his fate. He and his 'Phalanx' had siphoned energy from the National Revolution in the most insidious way. One less opportunist standing in the way of fascism."

She'd never expected to get out, but apparently somegriff with some strings to pull had liked what she had to say in her prison memoirs. Or perhaps the fascists had just wanted to make a display of generosity. Either way, she was out of prison, and her mind raced with thoughts of tracking down her old friends, figuring out who was alive, who was imprisoned, who had escaped, and who had died.\n\nFor now, she wandered aimlessly around Starfield, trying to shut her ears to the endless cacophony of their new music. Throughout her stay in prison, the fascists had experimented their dissonant creations on her and the other inmates. Initially she thought it was an exotic form of torture, but they actually liked it! All the shapes, the sounds, the colours of the new Aris were sharp, excessive, violent, migraine-inducing. Maybe it was different in Seaquestria, or out in the country?\n\nStopping to sit down on a park bench, Posada noticed a pair of Blackwings had been following her. Ah. This is why they let her out: to have her assassinated like Gatteotti. Posada resolved not to give them the satisfaction of coming quietly. As they got closer she noticed something odd about their uniforms: it wasn't the traditional vests of Aris First, nor the militaristic garb of Beakolini's goons. No, this was...\n\n"Posada!" one of the blackwings called jovially, his eyes obscured by dark sunglasses, "I'd heard you just got out of jail! So, how do you like it?"\nHe was wearing a tight, black uniform accented by neon red lines, and a round cap exactly like the one Posada had once sketched out for the Revolutionary Worker's Party. He even had a magnetic clasp with an atom design on it. Posada's eye twitched as the fascists paraded their uniforms -her designs!- in front of her and addressed her as if she'd always been a fashionista."

As expected they had captured the city with ease, having destroyed most of the resistance outside and annihilating the remaining defences with a twenty-four-seven bombing campaign. It was all either fire, rubble or corpses; nothing else could describe the state in which the city had been left.\n\nOcean Spray was trotting along a main road, approaching what had once been the royal palace with a considerable complement of legionnaires at his tail. He couldn’t miss an opportunity to see his dreams realised, especially not when his plans had been so successful.\n\nAs the troops made a slow march behind their leader, another sizable contingent of soldiers approached with a number of prisoners in tow and one in particular was especially intriguing.\n\nWhen they were near, a lieutenant pushed forward the very individual that he’d been studying. “Sir, we found [HIP.GetLeader] in a ‘secure’ bunker. Figured you’d want this one alive.”\n\nThe legionnaire managed to say it as though it was an easy feat, but there was a look in her eyes that told him how difficult it had really been. “Well done lieutenant, you and your soldiers are in line for a promotion; you’ve done much in service of Chiropterra.”\n\nThe officer saluted as Ocean Spray took another look at [HIP.GetLeader], before unholstering his pistol and killing the prisoner with two clean shots; one to the head and one to the heart. For the legionnaires time stood still for just a moment as their body went limp, all except for their commander-in-chief who unloaded his magazine and replaced the bullets he had just fired."

I shall see to it that this failing remains a secret. You will nevertheless be rewarded for your service, lieutenant.”\n\nThe officer saluted and allowed his commander-in-chief to inspect the soldiers that had been captured defending the palace.

All the same, a victory was a victory and it wasn’t as though the seaponies would be able to escape him if they decided to cause problems.

To be blunt, things were looking grim.\n\nHe sat at his desk, snout pressing against tightly clasped-together hooves. Ocean Spray wasn’t one for simply giving up; all he needed was a plan, one just as efficient as the last. He would kill every single traitor and make every effort to ensure that these blasted hippogriffs never had the chance to encroach on the sovereign homeland. If that meant he would have to fight every last one of these Nightmare-foresaken creatures, he would simply have to do it.\n\nEvery fire could eventually burn out and every revolution and rebellion could be crushed, given enough time; it was just up to him to douse the flames that had erupted."

### Legation Advisors ###
WIN_advisor_1:0 "Gilippo Gappi"
WIN_advisor_1_desc:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception. An international zone jointly ruled by the three nations.\n\nBut this is where Gappi faltered. He believed that the legation would be able to exist in perpetual peace. But now, with the reality of the Legation's situation clear to him, he has joined in its great game to ensure the interests of his nation come out on top.\n\n§rViva il Re e viva alla nazione!§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_2:0 "Ocean Spray"
WIN_advisor_2_desc:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions. This work gained him the attention of Emerald Light, who marked the Bat down for a higher position at a later time. That time came at Chiropterra's triumph over the Hippogriffs, when it and its allies established Winggarden. While the Council of Legions was looking for a bat to send, Emerald put Ocean Spray forth. He was competent, pious, and seemed like a good choice. But he was also personally loyal to his Silver Moon legion, a detail Commander Light was sure to leave out.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them. He often chides against his fellow representatives, continually wishing to assure his control over the Legation military, sometimes even against the other Chiropterran commanders' advice. Many question why someone as un-charasmatic as him was placed as the Chiropterran representative.\n\nSecretly though, this is all part of Chiropterra's place in the great game of Winggarden. Once a month Ocean Spray receives two letters. One from the Legionary Council and Warmaster of Chiropterra, his "official" orders, and another delievered to him secretly, Operation Nightlight, Winggarden's place in Lunar dominance of Zebrica, and then, further beyond.\n\n§CHe serves Her Imperial Majesty, Nightmare Moon, and the Silver Legion above all other things, and he will not betray his duty.§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_3:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid"
WIN_advisor_3_desc:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. So, he drafted his proposal to Zalathel and submitted it, requesting the spot as Colthage's representative in the Legation, and promising great things should his efforts be supported. And so he was sent to Winggarden with a blank cheque. To do as he sees fit, and to bring prosperity to Colthage.\n\n§gFor the good of all its citizens.§!\n\n"

### Leader Descriptions ### 
WIN_GILIPO_GAPPI_DESC:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. But now that mission has failed, and he sits atop a shadow of what Winggarden once was. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception, he now sees that vision has failed.\n\nSo now he has a new job, find a Hippogriff who can adopt his Leader's ideology. And pray to the Trinity that it will keep the city stable."
WIN_OCEAN_SPRAY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of April, 960 in Batsby\n\n§YBiography§!: Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion soldiers; entering the service as quickly as he could he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions, eventually rising to be the Chiropterran Legate in Winggarden. But recently, things have changed.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them.\n\nBut now he has hit a new height. The Warmaster now sends him new orders. No longer is the plan to be careful subversion and maintaining control, now it shall only be absolute domination. Ocean Spray has seized his chance and has upended Chiropterran policy in Hippogriffia. He intends to use his position for the good of the nation and aim a "Dagger at Mount Aris" as he regularly says to his assistants.\n\nOcean Spray is in control of Winggarden now. And Nightmare help any creature who stands in his way. \n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
WIN_AZIZELQUART_ZAHUMIND_DESC:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state, and now the guardian of a new nation, the Colthago Nuovo Project. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. He just never expected to be leading it. After the fall of the Legation, Zahummid has done his best to save many aspects of the previous system. And with this, he has had even more freedom to implement his economic ideas. He has declared that his Colthago Nuovo will be a bastion of free market economics, proving that a nation can run itself off of the power of capital alone. But only time will show if he can succeed."
