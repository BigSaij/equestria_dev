 TRT_relocate_capital:0 "Relocate The Council"
 TRT_relocate_capital_desc:0 "Tambelon is not safe. Proceed with the relocation plan. The council must depart immediately to ensure its members do not get captured by the enemy. Once relocation is complete, commence execution of the original plan.\n\n"Live, so you may cleanse.""
 TRT_exterminate:0 "Reward The Troggles For Their Service"
 TRT_exterminate_desc:0 "The troggles have outlived their usefulness and their loyalty can never be guaranteed. They are hence reclassified into filth. Filth must be cleansed. Treat them like any other sub-goat race.\n\n"Do not cling on to useless things out of pure sentimentality. That is weakness.""
 TRT_mass_crystal_production:0 "Expand Crystal Production"
 TRT_mass_crystal_production_desc:0 "Crystal production has remained conservative due to reluctance to waste slaves. This is no longer of any concern. Scope of production must be greatly expanded to meet our needs. Conversion subjects can be told before procedure that this way they will cease to be useless.\n\n"Death is only the beginning.""
 TRT_begin_marching:0 "Begin The Death March"
 TRT_begin_marching_desc:0 "Purging was once used against our former master-race. Path of Now and Forever was flawed due to not applying this method to all other potential master-races. The grim task must now be fulfilled out of necessity. Use any means available to ensure no one survives.\n\n"Only a world with a single sapient race will know peace and freedom.""
 TRT_increased_fear:0 "Fear Of Extinction"
 TRT_increased_fear_desc:0 "Sapient creatures are naturally afraid of dying. Fear factor levels can be increased to levels never before reached. Power of goatkind will be unmatched.\n\n"Fear is the key, fear is what liberates us, fear is what keeps us free. They must always fear us.""
 TRT_recycling:0 "Develop Great Maws"
 TRT_recycling_desc:0 "A new kind of monster has been created: a large mouth with a digestive system attached to it. It will convert filth into pure, raw biomass. This will allow us to greatly accelerate biomass production.\n\n"Let no one call us wasteful!""
 TRT_new_economy:0 "A New Economic System"
 TRT_new_economy_desc:0 "Without slaves, only goats remain to do all the required work. The age of decadence is over. Goats will no longer be free to do what they please. A third of their time must be spent fulfilling socio-economical obligations.\n\n"A single individual is nothing more than a single cell in a giant organism. The cell needs the organism just as much as the organism needs the cell.""
 TRT_new_occupation_law:0 "Let Them Feed"
 TRT_new_occupation_law_desc:0 "Monsters had been trained to spare those creatures that accepted slavery. This is no longer an option. Monsters must be allowed to prey upon target populations freely. Any "resistance movements" will spend all their time fighting for survival.\n\n"Monsters have preyed upon sapient creatures since primordial times. Why should the future be any different?""
 TRT_recycling_2:0 "Put The Troggles To Good Use"
 TRT_recycling_2_desc:0 "Usable biomass should not be left to rot. The troggles may continue to serve goatkind in another, more efficient form. Process them into raw biomass at once, then distribute it to the biomancers.\n\n"They will continue to serve us after death.""
 TRT_goat_generals:0 "New Leaders For The Monstrous Army"
 TRT_goat_generals_desc:0 "Without troggles, new military leadership is needed. Goats need to be promoted according to their talent and ability to learn. Heads of the council will become the highest-ranking army commanders.\n\n"Experience is the best teacher.""
 TRT_goatscription:0 "Introduce Goatscription"
 TRT_goatscription_desc:0 "Fighting can no longer be left to slave-soldiers or volunteers. It is the duty of goats to serve. More monster-handlers and biomancers are needed. Refusal to serve will be punished. Once world purification is complete, conscripts can be relieved.\n\n"There is nothing more noble than sacrificing yourself for the greater good.""

 eaw_decisions.1.t:0 "A New Base Of Operations"
 eaw_decisions.1.d:0 "Oskar, Giles and Gore were seated around a table in silence. This room was in a house of some low-life filth that had been cleansed. Now, it would be their temporary headquarters. The move had been done out of necessity, to prevent quick defeat to those who refused to accept the light of the Eternal Doctrine, yet it still felt like they had been cast out from the paradise of Tambelon.\n\n"I am glad you accepted me as part of the council," Gore said, breaking the silence. "I know you were sceptical, but you told me the All-Father saw the wisdom of your doctrine. Therefore, I am obliged to follow it."\n"Yes, we're glad you did not betray us," Oskar grumbled. "Like all the other goat traitors."\n"Don't let anger overcome you," Giles said. "Once we inevitably prove the superiority of our pure doctrine, they will see the error of their ways and surrender. Then the Father will lead us again."\n"Yes! We must not waver! We must have faith in victory. When other goats see the light, see the darkness of their doomed path, they will welcome us as guides and teachers. Then, we shall execute the Doctrine and reach unto eternity."\nOskar smiled. "Thank you, my friends. I am sure that together we will triumph as before. Now, let us discuss our plans of action.""
