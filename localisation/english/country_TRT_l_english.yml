 TRT_exterminate:0 "Reward The Troggles For Their Service"
 TRT_exterminate_desc:0 "The troggles have outlived their usefulness and their loyalty can never be guaranteed. They are hence reclassified into filth. Filth must be cleansed. Treat them like any other sub-goat race.\n\n"Do not cling on to useless things out of pure sentimentality. That is weakness.""
 TRT_mass_crystal_production:0 "Expand Crystal Production"
 TRT_mass_crystal_production_desc:0 "Crystal production has remained conservative due to reluctance to waste slaves. This is no longer of any concern.

 TRT_begin_marching:0 "Begin The Death March"
 TRT_begin_marching_desc:0 "We once purged our former master-race to ensure our eternal freedom. It was the folly of the Path of Now and Forever to not do the same to all the other races.

 TRT_recycling:0 "Develop Great Maws"

 TRT_recycling_2:0 "Put The Troggles To Good Use"
 TRT_recycling_2_desc:0 "Usable biomass should not be left to rot. The troggles may continue to serve goatkind in another, more efficient form. Process them into raw biomass at once, then distribute it to the biomancers.\n\n"They will continue to serve us after death.""
 TRT_goat_generals:0 "New Leaders For The Monstrous Army"
 TRT_goat_generals_desc:0 "We relied too much on the military expertise of the troggles before. It is time for us to learn how to lead our monsters to victory by ourselves. Heads of the council shall now become the highest-ranking army commanders.\n\n"Experience is the best teacher.""

 eaw_decisions.1.t:0 "A New Base Of Operations"
 eaw_decisions.1.d:0 "Oskar, Giles and Gore were seated around a table in silence. This room was in a house of some low-life filth that had been cleansed. Now, it would be their temporary headquarters. The move had been done out of necessity, to prevent quick defeat to those who refused to accept the light of the Eternal Doctrine, yet it still felt like they had been cast out from the paradise of Tambelon.\n\n"I am glad you accepted me as part of the council," Gore said, breaking the silence. "I know you were sceptical, but you told me the All-Father saw the wisdom of your doctrine. Therefore, I am obliged to follow it."\n"Yes, we're glad you did not betray us," Oskar grumbled. "Like all the other goat traitors."\n"Don't let anger overcome you," Giles said. "Once we inevitably prove the superiority of our pure doctrine, they will see the error of their ways and surrender. Then the Father will lead us again."\n"Yes! We must not waver! We must have faith in victory. When other goats see the light, see the darkness of their doomed path, they will welcome us as guides and teachers. Then, we shall execute the Doctrine and reach unto eternity."\nOskar smiled. "Thank you, my friends. I am sure that together we will triumph as before. Now, let us discuss our plans of action.""
