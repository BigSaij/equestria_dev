 TRT_relocate_capital:0 "Relocate The Council"
 TRT_relocate_capital_desc:0 "Tambelon is not safe. Proceed with the relocation plan. The council must depart immediately to ensure its members do not get captured by the enemy. Once relocation is complete, commence execution of the original plan.\n\n"Live, so you may cleanse.""
 TRT_exterminate:0 "Reward The Troggles For Their Service"
 TRT_exterminate_desc:0 "The troggles have outlived their usefulness and their loyalty can never be guaranteed. They are hence reclassified into filth. Filth must be cleansed. Treat them like any other sub-goat race.\n\n"Do not cling on to useless things out of pure sentimentality. That is weakness.""
 TRT_mass_crystal_production:0 "Expand Crystal Production"
 TRT_mass_crystal_production_desc:0 "Crystal production has remained conservative due to reluctance to waste slaves. This is no longer of any concern. Scope of production must be greatly expanded to meet our needs. Conversion subjects can be told before procedure that this way they will cease to be useless.\n\n"Death is only the beginning.""
 TRT_begin_marching:0 "Begin The Death March"
 TRT_begin_marching_desc:0 "Purging was once used against our former master-race. Path of Now and Forever was flawed due to not applying this method to all other potential master-races. The grim task must now be fulfilled out of necessity. Use any means available to ensure no one survives.\n\n"Only a world with a single sapient race will know peace and freedom.""
 TRT_increased_fear:0 "Fear Of Extinction"
 TRT_increased_fear_desc:0 "Sapient creatures are naturally afraid of dying. Fear factor levels can be increased to levels never before reached. Power of goatkind will be unmatched.\n\n"Fear is the key, fear is what liberates us, fear is what keeps us free. They must always fear us.""
 TRT_recycling:0 "Develop Great Maws"
 TRT_recycling_desc:0 "A new kind of monster has been created: a large mouth with a digestive system attached to it. It will convert filth into pure, raw biomass. This will allow us to greatly accelerate biomass production.\n\n"Let no one call us wasteful!""
 TRT_new_economy:0 "A New Economic System"
 TRT_new_economy_desc:0 "Without slaves, only goats remain to do all the required work. The age of decadence is over. Goats will no longer be free to do what they please. A third of their time must be spent fulfilling socio-economical obligations.\n\n"A single individual is nothing more than a single cell in a giant organism. The cell needs the organism just as much as the organism needs the cell.""
 TRT_goat_production:0 "Mobilize The Workgoats"
 TRT_goat_production_desc:0 "Slaves can no longer be used for production of crystal-infused armour for monsters. Goats must take over this responsibility as well. Both productivity and product quality are expected to increase, as slaves were prone to sabotage and inaction.\n\n"A single motivated and magically gifted goat can do as much work as a thousand slaves.""
 TRT_new_occupation_law:0 "Let Them Feed"
 TRT_new_occupation_law_desc:0 "Monsters had been trained to spare those creatures that accepted slavery. This is no longer an option. Monsters must be allowed to prey upon target populations freely. Any "resistance movements" will spend all their time fighting for survival.\n\n"Monsters have preyed upon sapient creatures since primordial times. Why should the future be any different?""
 TRT_recycling_2:0 "Put The Troggles To Good Use"
 TRT_recycling_2_desc:0 "Usable biomass should not be left to rot. The troggles may continue to serve goatkind in another, more efficient form. Process them into raw biomass at once, then distribute it to the biomancers.\n\n"They will continue to serve us after death.""
 TRT_goat_generals:0 "New Leaders For The Monstrous Army"
 TRT_goat_generals_desc:0 "Without troggles, new military leadership is needed. Goats need to be promoted according to their talent and ability to learn. Heads of the council will become the highest-ranking army commanders.\n\n"Experience is the best teacher.""
 TRT_goatscription:0 "Introduce Goatscription"
 TRT_goatscription_desc:0 "Fighting can no longer be left to slave-soldiers or volunteers. It is the duty of goats to serve. More monster-handlers and biomancers are needed. Refusal to serve will be punished. Once world purification is complete, conscripts can be relieved.\n\n"There is nothing more noble than sacrificing yourself for the greater good.""
 TRT_repopulation:0 "Repopulate The World"
 TRT_repopulation_desc:0 "Global goat population is currently estimated to be around 500 000. Restoring population to pre-banishment levels will take centuries at current rate. Population growth needs to be accelerated by encouraging and supporting establishent and expansion of families.\n\n"A purified world is a garden full of fertile soil. All we must do is spread our seed, then we may grow and flourish.""
 TRT_superior_armor:0 "Superior Armour Design"
 TRT_superior_armor_desc:0 "Monstrous equipment currently has insufficient quality. Enemies develop increasingly effective countermeasures. We must adapt or die. Armour design must be improved immediately. Crafters will receive the new design as soon as it is ready.\n\n"Like clay I shall mould them and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them...""
 TRT_goatvisors:0 "Meritocratic Goatocracy"
 TRT_goatvisors_desc:0 "Goats who exemplify military genius must be promoted into commanding positions. Promotion is to be based entirely on meritocratic standards. Good performance need to be rewarded, but loyalty to the cause must be taken into account.\n\n"Survival of the fittest is a simple, universal biological principle. It cannot be avoided or subverted.""
 TRT_superior_magic:0 "Overpowered Magic"
 TRT_superior_magic_desc:0 "With sufficient levels of fear factor all goats will unlock their full potential. Godhood is within reach of all of us. Reality will bend to our will, or it will break.\n\n"Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds.""
 TRT_leviathan:0 "Leviathans"
 TRT_leviathan_desc:0 "Sea serpent design becoming increasingly obsolete. Proceed with developing an improved underwater monster design. It must be capable of facing the largest ships that sub-goat races are capable of making. Do not worry about biomass cost.\n\n"Behold, the hope of him is in vain; shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?""
 TRT_remake_titans:0 "Reverse-Engineer Titan Biology"
 TRT_remake_titans_desc:0 "Titans are primordial creatures with alien biology. With extensive study, the single specimen available can be deconstructed and thoroughly copied. Creation of artificial titans would provide us an upper hoof in the great battle against filth.\n\n"Will we next create false gods to rule over us? How proud we have become, and how blind.""
 
 TRT_relocate_capital_2:0 "A Safe Refuge"
 TRT_relocate_capital_2_desc:0 "It started without any warning. Some goats demanded others to convert to their "Eternal Doctrine" and kill all slaves on sight. Those who refused to obey were then violently attacked. This organized takeover attempt combined with the sudden disappearance of Grogar has led to the formation of a provisional council. However, Tambelon is no longer safe for it."
 TRT_save_troggles:0 "Save The Troggles"
 TRT_save_troggles_desc:0 "The troggles have served us faithfully so far. Yet they do not understand the context of this civil war, and many of them have remained loyal to the Eternal Doctrine, assuming themselves to be safe. They are very wrong. We must send goats to infiltrate our enemy and contact as many troggles as possible. Hopefully, they can be convinced to flee."
 TRT_reconsider_technology:0 "Reconsider Stance On Technology"
 TRT_reconsider_technology_desc:0 "Before, Grogar was strongly opposed to use of inventions made by the lesser races. However, would it not be ironic to use the technology of the subgoats against them? Besides, without the use of more advanced weapons, we might stand no chance against our enemies."
 TRT_more_slave_soldiers:0 "More Slave-Soldiers"
 TRT_more_slave_soldiers_desc:0 "Troggles have been used as slave-soldiers for a long time now, and have proven themselves to be loyal. Is there any reason to not use any other race as soldiers? There are warlike creatures on Zebrica who could be useful on the frontline. Why not throw them at our foes out of desperation, if nothing else?"

 eaw_decisions.1.t:0 "A New Base Of Operations"
 eaw_decisions.1.d_edge:0 "Oskar, Giles and Gore were seated around a table in silence. This room was in a house of some low-life filth that had been cleansed. Now, it would be their temporary headquarters. The move had been done out of necessity, to prevent quick defeat to those who refused to accept the light of the Eternal Doctrine, yet it still felt like they had been cast out from the paradise of Tambelon.\n\n"I am glad you accepted me as part of the council," Gore said, breaking the silence. "I know you were sceptical, but you told me the All-Father saw the wisdom of your doctrine. Therefore, I am obliged to follow it."\n"Yes, we're glad you did not betray us," Oskar grumbled. "Like all the other goat traitors."\n"Don't let anger overcome you," Giles said. "Once we inevitably prove the superiority of our pure doctrine, they will see the error of their ways and surrender. Then the Father will lead us again."\n"Yes! We must not waver! We must have faith in victory. When other goats see the light, see the darkness of their doomed path, they will welcome us as guides and teachers. Then, we shall execute the Doctrine and reach unto eternity."\nOskar smiled. "Thank you, my friends. I am sure that together we will triumph as before. Now, let us discuss our plans of action.""
 eaw_decisions.1.d_unedge:0 "Rachel, Randy and Abram were seated around a table in silence. They were inside a temporary tent that had been erected as their seat of government. Without Grogar, and with a cult running rampant, they had no option but to claim leadership over goats and flee to a secure location.\nRachel was the first one to break the silence. "So, um, am I the only one trying to process what just happened?"\nThe other two goats shook their heads. "We're back to being without our Father," Randy said. "And now we're stuck once again among this sub-goat filth! Everything was going so well, and now we've lost everything!"\n"Calm down," Abram said. "Maybe try munching on some paper. That helps me relax when I'm stressed."\n"We can't relax," Rachel said. "As part of the Faithful Six... erm, I guess it's the Faithful Three now, it is our duty to save goatkind and all of our slaves."\n"...Save our slaves?" Randy asked.\n"Well, yeah," Abram said, "those cultists said they should all be killed."\n"I... I was good friends with a sub-goat once," Randy admitted. "A minotaur. Sure, he was filth, but he doesn't deserve death. That's just cruel."\n"Exactly," Rachel confirmed. "They're taking things too far. Who knows, maybe they even imprisoned Grogar or did something worse to him. We have to stop them, and we can only do it by working together!""
 eaw_decisions.1.a:0 "United, we will win."
 eaw_decisions.2.t:0 "It Never Ends"
 eaw_decisions.2.d:0 "Grogar looked up at a great organic capillary tower that reached far above the clouds. Then he looked down at numerous gates of stone and crystal that were being constructed by goats. "Bray, I want a detailed repo-" Grogar said before realizing that Bray was dead. He snorted out of frustration, then headed down a set of stairs.\n\nEventually, he found the Faithful Three, Gore, Oskar and Giles. "There you are," he said. "I want a detailed report about our progress."\nThe three bowed to him. "Father," Oskar said, "The first experiments of space-born monsters has been a relative success. They survived for several hours before suffocating, and were able to reach great velocities. At this rate we will reach our goals within a decade."\n"Father," Gore said, "The dimensional portals are nearing completion. By studying portals constructed by ponies, we were able to create replicas that function for several minutes before collapsing. At this rate we will reach our goals within a decade."\n"All other worlds will be within our grasp," Giles concluded. "We just have to be patient."\nGrogar frowned. "I've been patient for millenia. A decade means nothing to me. But when we are ready, we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. Only then can the multiverse be truly safe from mental enslavement.""
 eaw_decisions.2.a:0 "Death is preferable to slavery."
 eaw_decisions.3.t:0 "Betrayal"
 eaw_decisions.3.d:0 ""What do you mean all troggles have left and joined our enemy?!" Oskar demanded to know.\nThe fearful goat visibly shrank. "I... well, which part of it do you not understand?"\nGore tried to defuse the situation with a smile. "I think he does not understand why they did so."\n"Isn't it obvious?" Giles replied with a snort. "The goats who follow the Path of Now and Forever wanted to keep their precious slave-soldiers, so they sent agents to contact and rescue the troggles." He shrugged. "It doesn't change much. We will simply cleanse them later."\n"""
 eaw_decisions.3.a:0 "So much for their loyalty..."
 eaw_decisions.4.t:0 "Technophobia"
 eaw_decisions.4.d:0 ""Call me a heretic if you want," Rachel told the assembled council, "but there are far worse heretics out there. Besides, nothing about the original Path of Now and Forever says anything about the use of advanced technology."\n"Unless it's related to mind control," Abram added. "I learned that from my time in the archives."\n"Yes, except that. But what other obstacles are there? Sure, the inventions were made by filth as we call them, but does that taint them? Can the idea not be detached from the creatures who made them?"\n"I've had my experience with technology, too," Randy said. "The devices lesser races have made can be very useful. Like the microphone I had to amplify my bleating."\n"Exactly!" Rachel replied. "Why would we deny useful tools for ourselves? We're just pointlessly crippling ourselves, which might end up dooming us. We need any advantage we can get against our foes, before it is too late!"\n\nThe councilgoats murmured. After a while, Abram spoke out: "We have decided to assign our most intelligent goats to study the machines of the subgoats. The Father might be displeased, but I think even He can be convinced that this is the right thing to do in times of crisis."\nRachel smiled."
