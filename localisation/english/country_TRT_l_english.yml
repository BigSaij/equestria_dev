 eaw_decisions.1.d:0 "Oskar, Giles and Gore were seated around a table in silence. This room was in a house of some low-life filth that had been cleansed. Now, it would be their temporary headquarters. The move had been done out of necessity, to prevent quick defeat to those who refused to accept the light of the Eternal Doctrine, yet it still felt like they had been cast out from the paradise of Tambelon.\n\n"I am glad you accepted me as part of the council," Gore said, breaking the silence. "I know you were sceptical, but you told me the All-Father saw the wisdom of your doctrine. Therefore, I am obliged to follow it."\n"Yes, we're glad you did not betray us," Oskar grumbled. "Like all the other goat traitors."\n"Don't let anger overcome you," Giles said. "Once we inevitably prove the superiority of our pure doctrine, they will see the error of their ways and surrender. Then the Father will lead us again."\n"Yes! We must not waver! We must have faith in victory. When other goats see the light, see the darkness of their doomed path, they will welcome us as guides and teachers. Then, we shall execute the Doctrine and reach unto eternity."\nOskar smiled. "Thank you, my friends. I am sure that together we will triumph as before. Now, let us discuss our plans of action.""
