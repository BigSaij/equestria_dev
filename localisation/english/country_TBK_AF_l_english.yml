This is big for Jaddar, as not only did he just cast magic but he cast healing magic, which is extremely rare and powerful. Yet the ponies don't notice his shock and stare shocked The pony he healed says it is a miracle and bows but Jaddar lifts them back up, quickly saying he isn't a god but simply a messenger of Surael.
