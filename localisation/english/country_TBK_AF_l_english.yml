But that is not the only thing that seems so strange."

 TBK_AF_his_task: "His Task" # NILA DONE
 TBK_AF_his_task_desc: "My purpose here is not just to survive. If I was brought to this world, then I must consider what I can still do to fulfill the will of Surael.

 TBK_AF_event_start.1.d: "Throughout the ages, the world has seen many strange or otherwise unique creatures appear and disappear. These innumerable mysteries often draw gazes when they appear, although as the world becomes smaller with technological advancements, their uniqueness often fades into obscurity.\n\nHowever, on some occasions, these oddities prove to be more than just a passing glance. Sometimes, they attract more than just a little bit of attention. Sometimes, they can change the course of history.\n\nOn a completely unrelated note, a tall, bipedal creature unlike any the world has seen before has emerged in the desert not too far from the city of Tobuck."
 TBK_AF_event_start.1.d.tbk: "Throughout the ages, the world has seen many strange or otherwise unique creatures appear and disappear. These innumerable mysteries often draw gazes when they appear, although as the world becomes smaller with technological advancements, their uniqueness often fades into obscurity.\n\nHowever, on some occasions, these oddities prove to be more than just a passing glance. Sometimes, they attract more than just a little bit of attention. Sometimes, they can change the course of history.\n\n---\n\nPea Shooter was the sort of pony who planned for everything. His one and only goal was to steal as much money as possible from Tobuck's coffers before returning home, so every loose thread and potential problem needed to be accounted for. However, a new issue has made its way to his desk: a report of a tall, bipedal creature unlike any the world has seen before emerging in the desert near the city of Tobuck."

 TBK_AF_event_start.2.t: "A Very Small Problem" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.2.d: "Princess Celestia was missing.\n\nOrdinarily, this would be a cause for mass panic and chaos. The ruler of Equestria was a very important individual, after all. Fortunately for everypony, Princess Luna was the first to notice her sister's absence. She had searched high and low, even the most obscure nooks and crannies of Canterlot Castle, but to no avail. Worryingly, she sensed that Celestia's hold on the sun had vanished with her.\n\nLuna's sister was inexplicably gone, and she had no idea what had befallen her.\n\nThe younger alicorn returned to her room and stared at her distraught face in the mirror. She didn't have much time now. She needed to do something before the ponies noticed. Something drastic. Who knows what kind of pandemonium would occur throughout Equestria if her little ponies discovered Princess Celestia was gone?! Not to mention the numerous other issues that Equestria was facing...\n\nShe glanced at her makeup next to her mirror. Something drastic indeed.\n\n---\n\nCuriously and in no relation at all to what had just happened, a mysterious bipedal creature has appeared in the desert near Tobuck."

 TBK_AF_event_start.3.t: "The Herald's Arrival" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.3.d: "It had been some time since Jaddar Jexiszuir had awoken from his battle with Zokka, Devourer of Suns. The fearsome gnoll had gathered a formidable force, but he did not have the light of Surael on his side.\n\nJaddar looked around as his horse reached the crest of the dunes he had found himself in. This desert was a juxtaposition of comforting and unnerving; it was definitely not his homeland of East Salahad. He focused on the last thing he remembered before awakening in this strange land: The mighty desert elves of his Jaddari Legion had clashed with the terrible gnolls of Zokka in the War for the Eastern Sands. The battle was fierce, but in time, Zokka's forces began to overwhelm those of Jaddar. As Jaddar lay dying before the gnoll, his thoughts drifted to his family. He whispered a prayer for their safety, for if the Malevolent Dark was victorious, then they along with all the world would suffer. Suddenly a brilliant, almost divine light appeared in the sky, blinding him and silencing the battle in its entirety. And then...\n\nJaddar supposed that the light must have been an intervention by Surael. How else was he to explain his mysterious transportation to this foreign land? His forces, the Desert Legion of Jaddari, were nowhere to be seen, but neither were the gnolls of Zokka. Not to mention, ever since he had awoken, he felt... different, he supposed. He placed his hand on his chest and took a deep breath. He could feel something had changed within him, but as for what, he did not know. That feeling could be investigated later - now, he needed to find food and water. He had not lived for over two hundred years in the desert just to die to it.\n\nJust as Jaddar tugged at the reigns of his horse toward the setting sun, he noticed something in the distance in the opposite direction. He had to squint, but he saw a small group of zebras walking through the desert, just as he was. He observed them for a short while, only to become even more perplexed as the animals appeared to be clad in cloth wrappings like those a desert elf would wear, as well as... wait... "Are those zebras... talking to each other?" Jaddar wondered aloud.\n\n"It seems like they are," his horse concurred."

 TBK_AF_event_start.4.d: ""I can walk, Jahorše, I insist."\n\n"And I insist that I carry you, Jaddar. Your weight is negligible to me, and I am more than happy to aid you however I can."\n\nIn truth, Jaddar was starting to get a bit tired from walking so much, but he did not want to treat another sapient being as a slave. "I am not comfortable treating you like a common animal, Jahorše."\n\nJahorše raised an eyebrow at the elf. "I have served you all my life, Jaddar. I have no intention to stop now." He trotted forward and turned around to face Jaddar. "I do not know what mystical power transported us here, but it brought me a greater understanding of myself and the world around me. Before, I merely enjoyed your voice and your praise. Now, I see you as my closest friend." Jahorše spun himself and gestured toward his saddle. "Let me help you, as friends do."\n\n---\n\nIn time, the two spotted a settlement in the distance. Relief washed over both of them, as their meager supplies had dried up earlier that day. The speed at which they rode increased in excitement to reach civilization, but as they got closer, they noticed something concerning: screaming. They picked up the pace and saw many other equine figures running around as a strange worm-like creature with tentacles erupting from its mouth chased after them. The villagers seemed ill-equipped to defeat the monster, as it had a few blades and sharp instruments protruding from its scaled exterior.\n\nA monstrous roar, a cloud of dust left in its wake... it seemed like something from the Masnsih's old legends about the Sand Demon, only this beast was much, much smaller than the gargantuan dragon Jaddar knew of. Still, this thing was trying to kill the innocent, and Jaddar had not been made Surael's herald to sit idle in His mission.\n\nDespite exchanging no words, Jahorše seemed to know what must be done. "How shall we approach this, Jaddar?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.a: ""It is too formidable to defeat. We shall aid the villagers in their escape.""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.b: ""If blades can pierce it, then so can my arrows. We shall fight it and drive it away.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.5.d: "Today was not Light Bringer's day. Of course a tatzlwurm would attack her friend's village while she was visiting. Of course it would be a tiny one, making it far more agile than its full grown counterparts. Of course Light was the only unicorn in the area at the time. And of course she had left her gun at home.\n\nIt was all Light could do to hold the tatzlwurm's attention. She had barely dodged its tentacles thrice in quick succession, and her muscles were screaming in agony, letting her know that a fourth dodge attempt might be her last. She desperately fired meager magic bolts at the beast, but to no avail.\n\nShe really wished she was still in Tobuck.\n\nJust as the tatzlwurm was about to reach her again, she was roughly scooped up off of the ground and pulled away. In a daze, she looked to see what had grabbed her: some sort of... minotaur-thing with an arched nose and pointed ears? It wasn't quite the same, but it was seated on the back of a large, muscular horse. The unusual being glanced at her, then spoke with an exotic, yet commanding accent. "Are you okay?" She merely nodded, still shocked by the sudden appearance of her mysterious saviour.\n\nThe bipedal stranger set her down some distance away from the tatzlwurm. "Help gather the others. I shall lead the creature away." Definitely a male voice, Light noted.\n\nJust as quickly as he finished speaking, her new friend sped away on the back of his horse. Light had heard tell of abyssinian slave owners who rode ponies like that, but... this seemed different. These two were companions, she could tell.\n\nLight shook her head and gathered herself. Her assessment of this odd fellow could wait - he was out there trying to save her and the other villagers. She ran around and helped organize those she could find while the mysterious pair ran circles around the tatzlwurm. Eventually, it seemed to grow either tired or bored, for it gave up its pursuit and returned to the desert."

He was using a bow, of all things, instead of a gun or magic! Light suddenly felt inadequate, as the archer was so skilled that he drove several arrows into the cracks between the scales in quick succession. The tatzlwurm roared loudly in pain, dove back into the sand, then retreated from the pair that had injured it."

 TBK_AF_event_start.7.t: "The Miracle" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.7.d: "Somehow, despite the damage caused to the village, there were no fatalities. The local ponies and zebras began its reconstruction in earnest while Jaddar briefly rested against the side of a sandstone wall. Jahorše laid near him and was curiously staring at the smaller equines. Jaddar took a sip from his waterskin and contemplated today's events. Many strange things had happened, and he was still unsure of Surael's purpose in sending him here, or how he could best continue the fight against the Darkness.\n\n"I don't know what to make of this place and its people."\n\nJaddar's idle thoughts were halted by Jahorše's comment. Only now did he see just how fascinated Jahorše was by the villagers - not only were they sapient equines like him, but they had presumably lived their whole lives with full awareness of who they were. He reached over and rested his hand atop Jahorše's mane. "I see people unlike any I have seen before, and I see them living lives not entirely unfamiliar. I think, wherever we are, we will find friends. And perhaps with friends we can continue Surael's great work."\n\nThe two sat in comforting silence for some time before they heard a sharp cry from a ruined structure. Jaddar stood up to get a better look and then saw some villagers helping a zebra foal with a nasty gash on her torso. He reached into his pouch and verified he still had some medicinal herbs, then approached the injured zebra.\n\nThe villagers tentatively let Jaddar approach the foal, who proceeded to examine the gash. However, just as he touched the foal, he felt a strange power emanating from himself, the same as he had sensed earlier. It flowed from his hand into the foal, whose wound closed before his very eyes. Jaddar stared wide-eyed and examined his hand. Had he just used magic? And healing magic at that? He was no mage, and even then, that kind of magic was supposed to be impossible. There was no doubt in his mind now - Surael had sent him here and blessed him with great power to save this realm from the Malevolent Dark. "It's a miracle..." The villagers whispered as they crowded around him. The foal stood and bowed, thanking him for using his divine power to heal her.\n\nJaddar reached his hand out and lifted the foal's face back up to meet her eyes. "I am no god." He stood and looked at the crowd, who were still stunned by his healing abilities. "I am simply a messenger of Surael."\n\nAfter a brief moment, Light Bringer spoke up. "What is Surael?"\n\nJaddar felt pride as he began to teach a new flock. "He is the God of the Sun. He is our defender against the Malevolent Dark. He has granted me the power to spread his message to all, for all can be a part of the Light of Surael...""

 TBK_AF_event_start.8.t: "With Friends Like These" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.8.d: "Wallnut Drive had many friends. His drinking buddies, his military buddies, even Alesia and Baragzen weren't that bad... most of the time. However, one thing that all of his friends had in common was that they were equine, like him. Not that being a pony or zebra was a bad thing, but lately, Wallnut had been on the lookout for more exotic individuals to add to his circle of pals. That meant when one of his subordinates informed him of a "tall weirdo" performing miracles in a nearby village, he knew what to do: gather a small entourage and set off to meet this exotic fellow.\n\nUpon Wallnut's arrival in the village, the first thing he noticed was the crowd. Comprised mostly of zebras, it was hard to tell exactly how many were present, but the one they were gathered around was impossible to miss: a tall, bipedal creature who spoke with a commanding voice. He heard some phrases like "Sun god" and "Light", which meant he was likely the religious sort. No biggie, Wallnut thought, as long as he didn't worship Nightmare Moon!\n\nThe tall being spotted Wallnut's group and stopped his sermon. "Greetings," he said loudly, causing the crowd to turn their heads to Wallnut, "Have you come to hear the truth of Surael's Light and our mission to aid him in his war against the Malevolent Dark?"\n\nIt was then that Wallnut noticed another individual standing beside the creature: a very, very large horse. Much larger than any he'd seen before, and he'd met a saddle arabian! The horse was clad in barding and armor unlike any Wallnut had ever seen, with... was that a saddle on his back? Wallnut shook his head before he got further lost in tangential thoughts. "War against the dark? Buddy, I've been fightin' the darkness for years now," Wallnut laughed. "Can I ask your name?"\n\n"I am Jaddar Jexiszuir, the chosen Herald of Surael, the Sun God." Jaddar then gestured to his horse, "And this is my faithful companion, Jahorše, sixty-fourth of his name."\n\nWallnut began to approach the pair. He noticed Jahorše lock eyes with him, so he smiled and waved a hoof. After a moment, Jahorše waved back, though he did so with a strange stiffness in his gesture, like he was unused to moving his hoof like that. Hmm. Wallnut turned his gaze back to Jaddar. "Cool. So, Jaddar. Can I call ya Jadd? I know some real nasty folks who practically worship the darkness. They've been causin' me and a whole lotta other innocent people trouble. Wanna help me take 'em down?"\n\n"If what you say is true, then I shall gladly march with you. I can see by how your soldiers look at you that you are a respected military commander. May I have your name as well?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.8.a: "He reached a hoof out. "The name's Wallnut Drive. Always a pleasure to make new friends.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.9.t: "The Gun Runner's Unease" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.9.d: "Pea Shooter sat in his office, absorbing the information on his desk. There were an ever-increasing number of reports of a new god appearing in the desert, though some conflicting accounts described the being as a prophet or a messenger instead. To Pea, the difference mattered little. He needed to keep this nuisance in check, otherwise, a rampantly growing religious fervor might spell an early end to his operations.\n\nHe examined a blurry photo of the creature in question. It looked almost like a minotaur, though instead of horns, it had pointed ears. Despite it being relatively mundane in appearance, Pea felt uneasy looking at the thing. He scoffed, then threw it in the trash. No matter. Wallnut may be missing, but the other warlords were still around and easily coercible. He'd send Alesia and Baragzen to take care of the creature, then he could return to business as usual.\n\nAlthough...\n\nPea glanced at the reports again. Nearly every settlement that this creature visited ended up joining its movement. If, no, when it arrived at Tobuck, there was a strong chance that...\n\nHe picked up his phone. He needed to offload as much money as possible into offshore accounts just in case his tenure in Tobuck was suddenly cut short by a zealot taking over the city. There was no doubt in his mind: Any sort of religious fellow would not look kindly upon the innumerable shady dealings he had taken to establish his money laundering scheme."

 TBK_AF_event_start.10.t: "With Even More Friends Like These" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.10.d: ""Tell me, Wallnut," Jaddar asked as he and his growing following were heading to another nearby settlement, "This 'Chiropterra', they serve a god of darkness and nightmares, correct?"\n\n"Nightmare Moon, yep! Let me tell you: every rumor you hear about them is true. In fact, I used to live there! But I never liked 'em, so I ditched 'em and made their army look like buffoons! They sure like holding grudges, though, so now they want me and all my friends dead."\n\n"Then they shall serve as our first test," Jaddar stated with no doubt in his mind about the outcome of this inevitable conflict. He glanced behind him. Surael's blessing had gifted him with a new flock, and he had no intention of squandering this opportunity. He would unite this land and prepare them to face the Malevolent Dark, and after that... his thoughts drifted to his wife and daughter. If this place truly was another world, then he needed to find a way to return to them.\n\nWallnut's voice pierced his idle musing. "Hey, I see a group up ahead." Both of them squinted their eyes as they saw an equally sized group to theirs approaching them in the distance. After a moment, Wallnut perked up and grinned, "Oh hey, it's my buds!" He jumped up and waved in the air. "Alesia! Baragzen! Over here!"\n\nSoon, the two gatherings converged. There was some brief unease as Jaddar observed the opposing group moving like a military force. His unease turned to confusion as he could not spot their weapons. They had no swords, no archers, just long sticks with the occasional short blade attached at the end. Furthermore, their strange, boxy carriages seemed to be pulling themselves. As he was processing that, Wallnut wasted no time hopping over to speak to them. They were mostly zebras and "ponies," as Wallnut had informed him earlier. Apparently, "horses" were a distinctly different race. He would have to find one to compare to Jahorše later.\n\nThe two individuals that Wallnut was speaking to kept stealing curious glances at him. After a few minutes, all three of them turned to approach Jaddar. Wallnut put a hoof behind his head, "So uh, Alesia and Baragzen were sent here to, uh, kill you. But! They think Pea Shooter—that's our boss—is lying to them about you being a threat. I said that you're gonna help me put a stop to all the bad things happening around here, and they, uh, want some proof that you're actually a nice guy and capable and all that. Mind helping me out here?"\n\nJaddar nodded as he descended from Jahorše. His friend needed his help, and so he convinced them..."

 TBK_AF_event_start.11.d: "Truthfully, Light Bringer did not imagine herself becoming a motivational speaker and impromptu second-in-command for a religious movement. She was more the sort to rile up others about lousy fiction, but she supposed that appealing to the emotions and desires of her fans could be easily translated to what she now found herself doing. Which in this case was settling an argument between a civilian and one of Baragzen's mercenaries.\n\nThe two had been at it for some time, with the civilian claiming that Jaddar would finally save their homeland from corruption, while the mercenary insisted that Jaddar was merely assisting Baragzen in becoming lord over his rightful domain. Light Bringer soon settled this debacle by explaining that the two goals weren't mutually exclusive with one another. After all, Jaddar had said that there was a place for all under the Light of Surael. Though Light Bringer did have to clarify that she was not the Light of Surael, as some have misconstrued from her name.\n\nLight Bringer turned her gaze forward, looking past the marching columns of followers that had accumulated so quickly in such a short time. Leading them was of course Jaddar, who stared into the distant city of Tobuck with determination. Their next mission was to free that city from the false promises made by its fake president. Spirits were high, and all present could tell that once they secured the capital of this republic, great changes would occur in Tobuck, and perhaps Zebrica as a whole."

 TBK_AF_event_start.12.t: "The President's Due" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_start.12.d: "The seizure of Tobuck turned out to be anti-climactic. Jaddar's forces were prepared to fight, yet little resistance was given to them. In fact, the city's residents seemed almost glad to see them. The capitol was the only place that had guards willing to fight, but in a masterful display of negotiations, Jaddar convinced them to surrender rather than give up their lives for a president who did not value theirs.\n\nSaid president was missing from the capitol, however. Jaddar was about to organize a manhunt, but then inadvertently stumbled upon the stallion attempting to slip by his forces with a hooded cloak. Said stallion was quickly apprehended and stripped of his disguise.\n\n"I assure you, I was not trying to run," Pea Shooter lied through his teeth, "I often discreetly visit the marketplace to gauge how the common pony is handling my economic changes."\n\nJaddar dismounted from Jahorše, then knelt before the increasingly nervous-looking president. "Pea Shooter. You are a talented leader, in a sense. You know how to get others to do your bidding. You know just what to say and what to do to obtain the outcome you want." Jaddar paused, then looked at his surroundings. All who had accompanied him seemed eager to see what he would do to one who had attempted to have him killed. "And yet you show dishonesty before me. Before Surael. Why?"\n\nPea Shooter forced his best presidential smile and doubled down. "I have never been dishonest with anyone. I have always had the best interests of Tobuck and her citizens in my heart."\n\nJaddar was disappointed. This kind of creature was often incapable of banishing the Darkness from their heart. Normally, he would issue his standard ultimatum of "join or be banished" to such a creature, but the time he had spent with his new friends had given him another idea. He reached his hand forward and rested it atop Pea's shoulder. "Then you shall practice what you preach. You shall serve as my statesman and manage the ongoings of my empire while I spread the Light of Surael throughout this realm. I entrust this sacred task to you, and you shall be guarded to ensure your safety, as I suspect many will act against us."\n\nA brief expression of horror dawned on Pea Shooter's face as he realized he wouldn't be returning home to his wife and kids anytime soon. Jaddar paid this no mind and stood up to the cheers of his flock. This was a momentous accomplishment, but more trials yet remained."

 ### Main tree events

 TBK_AF_event_general.1.t: "The Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.1.d: "It had been some time since Pea Shooter was put on what was essentially house arrest. Jaddar's followers didn't call it that, but Pea knew that his new job for this theocratic state had an unwritten stipulation of him not being allowed to leave. The numerous guards present around his estate were proof enough of that.\n\nHowever, Pea was a crafty stallion. His sweet Mayflower was waiting for him at home, and though he'd secured barely enough funds in offshore accounts to pay off his family's debt, he knew that the money was useless unless he was back in Equestria to withdraw it.\n\nThus, Pea found himself waiting on the balcony of his residence in the dead of night for his ticket out of here. He'd managed to scrape together enough money to bribe the delivery pony of a local hayburger joint to make a detour to his house, so with any luck...\n\nPea's eyes darted as he saw movement in the alleyway below. There! A pony pulling a hay cart! He patiently waited until the cart was just underneath the balcony, then dropped down into the moving pile of hay. Pea winced as he hit the pile. It wasn't the softest landing ever, but step one was complete. Now all he needed to do was make his way to the port, and-\n\n"Mr. Shooter! Are you okay?" a loud voice called from nearby.\n\nHorseapples. Pea turned to see one of his guards running towards him. He mentally kicked himself. He knew the plan was a long shot, but he should have realized that the cart was the only interesting thing to look at. Of course the guards would be watching it.\n\nThe guard reached Pea and then helped him down from the cart. "You shouldn't lean over your balcony like that, Mr. Shooter! It's dangerous! You're very lucky that this hay cart was here to catch your fall!"\n\nPea forced a smile. "Yes. My mistake.""

 TBK_AF_event_general.2.t: "The Second Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.2.d: ""Where is it..." Pea Shooter muttered to himself as his guards escorted him to his workplace. Over the past few months during his trips to and from work, he had spotted a crevice between two buildings that looked like a promising avenue to get away from his entourage. He had spent an inordinate amount of time memorizing the layout of the streets beyond the crevice to maximize the distance he could put between himself and his guards once they realized he was missing.\n\nFortunately, the guards did not see his earlier leap from the balcony as an escape attempt, or they would be paying closer attention to him. Additionally, Pea had built a rapport with some of them, which meant he had convinced them to allow him to walk to work rather than ride in the back seat of the former presidential car. A "breath of fresh air is good for the body", as he had put it.\n\nThrough the streets, they walked, with a few civilians casting curious glances at the armed escort surrounding the lanky earth pony. Pea's eyes locked on an upcoming bar adorned with a red logo. There! The crevice was fast approaching. He withdrew a glass bottle from his coat in preparation. Once he was next to the crevice, he dropped the bottle and kicked it to his left. It shattered on the pavement of the road, and as the heads of his guards turned to look, he darted to the right into the crevice.\n\nAlthough he knew better than to look back, he couldn't resist the idea of seeing the look of confusion on his guards' faces once they realized that- "Ow!" yelped a voice as Pea tumbled into a young foal.\n\n"What was that?" said a guard. Pea Shooter's eyes went wide as he looked ahead past the foal who was blocking his way; there simply wasn't enough time to shove past them and escape before the guards-\n\n"Um, sir? I'm lost, can you help me find my mom?" asked the foal. Pea gritted his teeth. He didn't have time for this!\n\n"Mr. Shooter!" One guard peered into the crevice and saw Pea reaching for the foal. The guard beckoned his fellows to join him, then followed after Pea. "How kind of you, Mr. Shooter! That foal was lost, and you went out of your way to try to help her! We shall make a detour to return her to her family!""

 TBK_AF_event_general.3.t: "The Third Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.3.d: "This attempt would be successful, Pea Shooter was sure of it. He'd meticulously double-checked every step of his plan; no corners were left unturned. He had been away from his family for far longer than he'd initially planned, and the money he had secured still rotted in an unreachable account. Who knows what sacrifices his beloved Mayflower might have needed to make to avoid their crippling debt?\n\nNow, having gone through the steps one final time, Pea put his plan into action. He started by suggesting that he and his guards have lunch at a restaurant by the dock to enjoy one another's company. They truly believed Pea was their friend, and so they agreed wholeheartedly. Pea had selected one with a bathroom tucked away from the dining area, and even timed the visit on the same day that the business was receiving a delivery from overseas.\n\nOnce they ordered their food, Pea waited until he heard the prolonged blast of a ship's horn from outside. It was the signal that the boat was about to leave, so he excused himself from the table to go to the bathroom. Once he turned the corner and was out of sight, he diverted to the employee-only area, ignoring those who told him he wasn't allowed there. Pea rushed out the kitchen's back door, then galloped as fast as he could toward the ship. He spotted a stallion waiting there, who nodded at him. Pea had already paid off this cargo vessel to grant him passage to Puerto Caballo. Once there, he would catch another boat to Equestria, then finally return home.\n\nPea got on the ship, then immediately headed to the lower deck. He allowed himself to relax next to a barrel of goods once the boat was a fair distance from the port. He sighed in relief, then looked out the porthole. To his dismay, he saw a military vessel intercepting the boat he was on. Why were they closing in on this specific ship?! Dozens of boats left and arrived at Tobuck every day! Pea got up, then looked into the barrel he was leaning against. His heart sank when he saw dozens of guns haphazardly stored inside what he believed to be food storage. He felt the boat drop anchor as the military vessel reached his. They would be boarding soon, so Pea sat back down and resigned himself to his fate.\n\n---\n\n"Mr. Shooter! How proactive of you! We had no idea this vessel was smuggling weapons, but you spotted them before anyone else!" Pea's ever-cheerful guard helped him off the ship. "We saw you sprinting onto the boat from the restaurant window, so we knew that you must have had a good reason for chasing after it! Now that we see these illegal weapons, we know why. Thank you for leading us to these smugglers, Mr. Shooter!""

 TBK_AF_event_general.4.t: "The Fourth Escape Attempt" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_general.4.d: "Pea Shooter was at his wit's end. He'd tried almost everything short of outright murder - bribes, distractions, even fleeing in broad daylight, but each time he was caught and brought back to his estate. Whether it was a miracle or a cruel twist of fate that his guards didn't think he was trying to escape, he didn't know. All he did know was that his family needed him, and he needed them. His anxiety had gotten to such a severe point that when his faithful guard opened his bedroom door to let him know it was time for work, he broke down and resorted to a tactic he would have once sworn was beneath him: begging. "Listen, please. I need to go home. My wife, my children - they need their father. I've been away for too long, I don't want to miss my children growing up more than I already have!"\n\nThe guard put a hoof to her mouth in shock. "I... I had no idea, Mr. Shooter! Is your family still in Equestria?"\n\nPea didn't even care enough to question how his guard knew that. "Yes," he pleaded, "Please, I need to see my family again. Can you help me?"\n\nTo his absolute surprise, the guard offered a tender smile and nodded. "Okay, okay. I'll help. But it'll take a bit of time, all right?"\n\n---\n\nA week later, Pea's guard discreetly brought him to the port at the break of dawn. She instructed him to wait for the next boat. He thanked her again, then patiently watched the sunrise while she walked away. However, just as the boat arrived, Pea heard an all too familiar voice behind him. "Pea Shooter, you look unwell. Tell me, what is the matter?"\n\nOf course, it was Jaddar. Pea stared straight at the boat as Jaddar sat next to him. "I miss my family. I don't want them to think that I abandoned them," Pea sounded utterly defeated, "But you don't understand, do you? You would rather I serve your precious sun god than spend time with what's really important."\n\nJaddar reached a hand to put it on Pea's shoulder. "I do understand, Pea. I understand more than anyone how difficult it is to be separated from one's family." He pointed at the ship's gangway. Pea's heart leaped to his throat as he saw his wife and kids getting off the boat. "When your guard told me of your plight, I had them transported here. I did this for you as I would for all who serve the Light, even if they don't believe in it or understand why. All I ask is that you continue serving as my statesman.""

 TBK_AF_event_military.1.a: "TODO"

 TBK_AF_event_military.2.t: "A Modern Curiosity" #Podrick
 TBK_AF_event_military.2.d: "One of the many things Tobuck was famous for was its former status as a weapons depot for the late Storm King. Guns of many kinds were prevalent throughout the city, and as guns were the most common tool of war nowadays...\n\n"I was told there would be weapons here, and yet I do not see any blades, nor bows."\n\nA very nervous pair of unicorns glanced at each other as Jaddar examined the firing range they were in charge of. "Well, um, Mr. Presiden- er, Mr. Herald, sir, we uh, stopped using those a long time ago."\n\n"Then what are these?" Jaddar curiously picked up a long stick with pieces of metal blended into it. He spotted a hole at the end, then put his finger inside to ascertain its depth.\n\n"NO DON'T DO THAT!" One unicorn yelled as she magically snatched the rifle away from Jaddar. She sighed in relief, then explained, "This is a Garcano-Ochzor Model 989. Breech-loaded, designed in Colthage. It's a bit old, but like all firearms, it's very dangerous if handled improperly."\n\nJaddar did not see how such a thing could be dangerous, but he was respectful nonetheless. "I've never seen such a device before. Would you care to spar? I wish to learn how it works."\n\n"You can't spar with guns," the other unicorn said, "You said something about bows? Imagine if bows could shoot tiny metal pellets at such high speeds and range that almost no body armor could protect from them, that you don't need years of training or even much physical strength to use them, and that they are cheap to produce. Nobody would use bows anymore." \n\nJaddar frowned as he absorbed their words. He was a master bowman, and now he was being told that his favorite weapon was obsolete. Still, Surael's work must be done, so he needed to learn how these new weapons worked. "Very well. Would you mind teaching me about these 'guns', and how they are used in battle?""
 TBK_AF_event_military.2.a: "The Malevolent Dark will be defeated, if not by bows, then by firearms."

 # News events

 TBK_AF_event_news.1.t: "Great Magical Anomaly"
 TBK_AF_event_news.1.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]At midday today, the world was shaken by an extremely unusual event: the sun stopped moving. The sky glowed strange shades of orange, and the very air itself seemed to quake. However, just as quickly as this phenomenon occurred, it stopped, and everything returned to normal. For some, this was seen as a sign from their local deity. For others, they began to worry. Those who were magically inclined could tell that something big had just happened. The question was, what was it?"
 TBK_AF_event_news.1.a: "Quite strange..."
 TBK_AF_event_news.1.b: "Is Princess Celestia alright?"
