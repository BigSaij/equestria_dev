 TBK_AF_event_start.2.b: "TODO go."

 TBK_AF_event_start.3.t: "The Herald of Surael"
 TBK_AF_event_start.3.d: "It had been some time since Jaddar Jexiszuir had awoken from his battle with Zokka, Devourer of Suns. The fearsome gnoll had gathered a formidable force, but he did not have the light of Surael on his side.\n\nJaddar looked around as his horse reached the crest of the dunes he had found himself in. This desert was a juxtaposition of comforting and unnerving; it was definitely not his homeland of East Salahad. He focused on the last thing he remembered before awakening in this strange land: The mighty desert elves of his Jaddari Legion had clashed with the terrible gnolls of Zokka in the War for the Eastern Sands. The battle was fierce, but in time, Jaddar's forces began to overwhelm those of Zokka. Just as Jaddar was about to personally deliver the final blow to Zokka, a brilliant, almost divine light blinded Jaddar and silenced the battle in its entirety. And then...\n\nJaddar supposed that the light must have been an intervention by Surael. How else was he to explain his mysterious transportation to this foreign land? His forces, the Desert Legion of Jaddari, were nowhere to be seen, but neither were the gnolls of Zokka. Not to mention, ever since he had awoken, he felt... different, he supposed. He placed his hand on his chest and took a deep breath. He could feel something had changed within him, but as for what, he did not know. That feeling could be investigated later - now, he needed to find food and water. He had not lived for over two hundred years in the desert just to die to it.\n\nJust as Jaddar tugged at the reigns of his horse toward the setting sun, he noticed something in the distance in the opposite direction. He had to squint, but he saw a small group of zebras walking through the desert, just as he was. He observed them for a short while, only to become even more perplexed as the animals appeared to be clad in cloth wrappings like those a desert elf would wear, as well as... wait... "Are those zebras... talking to each other?" Jaddar wondered aloud.\n\n"It seems like they are," his horse concurred."
 TBK_AF_event_start.3.a: "Jaddar stared at his faithful steed in utter shock."

 TBK_AF_event_start.4.t: "Friends and Monsters"
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.d: ""I can walk, Jahorše, I insist."\n\n"And I insist that I carry you, Jaddar. Your weight is negligible to me, and I am more than happy to aid you however I can."\n\nIn truth, Jaddar was starting to get a bit tired from walking so much, but he did not want to treat another sapient being as a slave. "I am not comfortable treating you like a common animal, Jahorše."\n\nJahorše raised an eyebrow at the elf. "I have served you all my life, Jaddar. I have no intention to stop now." He trotted forward and turned around to face Jaddar. "I do not know what mystical power transported us here, but it brought me a greater understanding of myself and the world around me. Before, I merely enjoyed your voice and your praise. Now, I see you as my closest friend." Jahorše spun himself and gestured toward his saddle. "Let me help you, as friends do."\n\n---\n\nIn time, the two spotted a settlement in the distance. Relief washed over both of them, as their meager supplies had dried up earlier that day. The speed at which they rode increased in excitement to reach civilization, but as they got closer, they noticed something concerning: screaming. They picked up the pace and saw many other equine figures running around as a strange worm-like creature with tentacles erupting from its mouth chased after them. The villagers seemed ill-equipped to defeat the monster, as it had a few blades and sharp instruments protruding from its scaled exterior.\n\nA monstrous roar, a cloud of dust left in its wake... it seemed like something from the Masnsih's old legends about the Sand Demon, only this beast was much, much smaller than the gargantuan dragon Jaddar knew of. Still, this thing was trying to kill the innocent, and Jaddar had not been made Surael's herald to sit idle in His mission.\n\nDespite exchanging no words, Jahorše seemed to know what must be done. "How shall we approach this, Jaddar?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.a: ""It is too formidable to defeat. We shall aid the villagers in their escape.""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.b: ""If blades can pierce it, then so can my arrows. We shall fight it and drive it away.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.5.t: "Saviour"
 TBK_AF_event_start.5.d: "Today was not Light Bringer's day. Of course a tatzlwurm would attack her friend's village while she was visiting. Of course it would be a tiny one, making it far more agile than its full grown counterparts. Of course Light was the only unicorn in the area at the time. And of course she had left her gun at home.\n\nIt was all Light could do to hold the tatzlwurm's attention. She had barely dodged its tentacles thrice in quick succession, and her muscles were screaming in agony, letting her know that a fourth dodge attempt might be her last. She desperately fired meager magic bolts at the beast, but to no avail.\n\nShe really wished she was still in Tobuck.\n\nJust as the tatzlwurm was about to reach her again, she was roughly scooped up off of the ground and pulled away. In a daze, she looked to see what had grabbed her: some sort of... minotaur-thing with an arched nose and pointed ears? It wasn't quite the same, but it was seated on the back of a large, muscular horse. The unusual being glanced at her, then spoke with an exotic, yet commanding accent. "Are you okay?" She merely nodded, still shocked by the sudden appearance of her mysterious saviour.\n\nThe bipedal stranger set her down some distance away from the tatzlwurm. "Help gather the others. I shall lead the creature away." Definitely a male voice, Light noted.\n\nJust as quickly as he finished speaking, her new friend sped away on the back of his horse. Light had heard tell of abyssinian slave owners who rode ponies like that, but... this seemed different. These two were companions, she could tell.\n\nLight shook her head and gathered herself. Her assessment of this odd fellow could wait - he was out there trying to save her and the other villagers. She ran around and helped organize those she could find while the mysterious pair ran circles around the tatzlwurm. Eventually, it seemed to grow either tired or bored, for it gave up its pursuit and returned to the desert."
 TBK_AF_event_start.5.a: "Light didn't know who this guy was, but he had just saved her and the village."

 TBK_AF_event_start.6.t: "Saviour"
 TBK_AF_event_start.6.d: "Today was not Light Bringer's day. Of course a tatzlwurm would attack her friend's village while she was visiting.

Her assessment of this odd fellow could wait - he was out there trying to save her and the other villagers. She ran around and helped organize those she could find while the bipedal fired arrow after arrow from atop the horse into the scales of the tatzl- wait, arrows? He was using a bow, of all things, instead of a gun or magic! Light suddenly felt inadequate, as the archer was so skilled that he drove several arrows into the cracks between the scales in quick succession. The tatzlwurm roared loudly in pain, dove back into the sand, then retreated from the pair that had injured it."
 TBK_AF_event_start.6.a: "Light didn't know who this guy was, but he had just saved her and the village."

 TBK_AF_event_start.7.t: "TODO"
 TBK_AF_event_start.7.d: "TODO fired by completing The Herald Arrives -focus - Jaddar rests in the village he helped at, watching it be rebuilt, and is trying to figure out what has happened to him. Maybe Jahorse could be conversing with him? Then nearby a pony gets hurt and Jaddar goes to help. But when he touches the hurt pony, his hand glows and the pony's wound gets healed. This is big for Jaddar, as not only did he just cast magic but he cast healing magic, which is extremely rare and powerful. Yet the ponies don't notice his shock and stare shocked The pony he healed says it is a miracle and bows but Jaddar lifts them back up, quickly saying he isn't a god but simply a messenger of Surael. Then Light Bringer, the pony from previous event, steps out from the crowd and asks what is Surael. Jaddar explains Surael is the god of Sun, defender against the Malevolent Dark, starting to then preach to the villagers."
