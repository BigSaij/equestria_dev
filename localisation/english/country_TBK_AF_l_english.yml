 TBK_AF_herald_arrives_desc: "My men were deep in battle against the gnolls. I was going to personally fight Zokka. I am, however, no longer on the dunes of the Eastern Salahad. I do not see my foe, nor do I see any of our armies. Instead, I am alone in another world with my mount. But that was not the only thing that seemed so strange."

 TBK_AF_his_task: "His Task" # Reserved for Nila
 TBK_AF_his_task_desc: "My purpose here is not just to survive. If I was brought to this world, then I must consider what I can still do to fulfill the will of Surael. Though I do not see any of my kin, I am comforted by the presence of creatures who can speak with me as I speak with them. Perhaps I must try to do what I can for now. Surael will guide me."

 TBK_AF_i_am_jaddar_desc: "I have wondered why I was brought to this world of speaking zebras and ponies, but I am no idle soul nor a fruitless thinker. It is the will of Surael that I have come. It is by his will that I am given the magic of this world to wield. It is for the Light that I must now bring the truths to its inhabitants. It is also time that I must prepare them for the war against the Dark."

No creature has defeated me nor have they defeated those who follow me. The Light is with us. The time for fighting has paused. Now I must consolidate what we have won. I must call all those who listen to the truths of Surael's Light."

 TBK_AF_empire_administration_desc: "Before Surael determined that I come here and wield power over this land, a faithless republic based on greed stood here. Now, that republic is no more, and I have brought the Light to its former citizens. For the Empire to stand without the Darkness undermining it, I must prepare it as Surael wills. The Light shall clean all that once stood here and make new this world."

 TBK_AF_survival_expertise_desc: "I have lived with little and so have my armies. It appears that the deserts of Zebrica have taught the same lessons of survival to its inhabitants.

 TBK_AF_new_kind_of_cavalry_desc: "When I fought the War on Hulann, I have never thought that cavalry would ever be set aside. But the war that must be fought on this world does not have the same understanding of cavalry as I do. Yet, just because they cannot be mounted does not mean they cannot fight. Instead, one must correct their assumptions. I shall do this and see how they fight."

 TBK_AF_event_start.2.a: "TODO go."
 TBK_AF_event_start.2.b: "TODO stay."

 TBK_AF_event_start.3.t: "The Herald of Surael"
 TBK_AF_event_start.3.d: "It had been some time since Jaddar Jexiszuir had awoken from his battle with Zokka, Devourer of Suns. The fearsome gnoll had gathered a formidable force, but he did not have the light of Surael on his side.\n\nJaddar looked around as his horse reached the crest of the dunes he had found himself in. This desert was a juxtaposition of comforting and unnerving; it was definitely not his homeland of East Salahad. He focused on the last thing he remembered before awakening in this strange land: The mighty desert elves of his Jaddari Legion had clashed with the terrible gnolls of Zokka in the War for the Eastern Sands. The battle was fierce, but in time, Jaddar's forces began to overwhelm those of Zokka. Just as Jaddar was about to personally deliver the final blow to Zokka, a brilliant, almost divine light blinded Jaddar and silenced the battle in its entirety. And then...\n\nJaddar supposed that the light must have been an intervention by Surael. How else was he to explain his mysterious transportation to this foreign land? His forces, the Desert Legion of Jaddari, were nowhere to be seen, but neither were the gnolls of Zokka. Not to mention, ever since he had awoken, he felt... different, he supposed. He placed his hand on his chest and took a deep breath. He could feel something had changed within him, but as for what, he did not know. That feeling could be investigated later - now, he needed to find food and water. He had not lived for over two hundred years in the desert just to die to it.\n\nJust as Jaddar tugged at the reigns of his horse toward the setting sun, he noticed something in the distance in the opposite direction. He had to squint, but he saw a small group of zebras walking through the desert, just as he was. He observed them for a short while, only to become even more perplexed as the animals appeared to be clad in cloth wrappings like those a desert elf would wear, as well as... wait... "Are those zebras... talking to each other?" Jaddar wondered aloud.\n\n"It seems like they are," his horse concurred."
 TBK_AF_event_start.3.a: "Jaddar stared at his faithful steed in utter shock."

 TBK_AF_event_start.4.t: "Friends and Monsters"
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.d: ""I can walk, Jahorše, I insist."\n\n"And I insist that I carry you, Jaddar. Your weight is negligible to me, and I am more than happy to aid you however I can."\n\nIn truth, Jaddar was starting to get a bit tired from walking so much, but he did not want to treat another sapient being as a slave. "I am not comfortable treating you like a common animal, Jahorše."\n\nJahorše raised an eyebrow at the elf. "I have served you all my life, Jaddar. I have no intention to stop now." He trotted forward and turned around to face Jaddar. "I do not know what mystical power transported us here, but it brought me a greater understanding of myself and the world around me. Before, I merely enjoyed your voice and your praise. Now, I see you as my closest friend." Jahorše spun himself and gestured toward his saddle. "Let me help you, as friends do."\n\n---\n\nIn time, the two spotted a settlement in the distance. Relief washed over both of them, as their meager supplies had dried up earlier that day. The speed at which they rode increased in excitement to reach civilization, but as they got closer, they noticed something concerning: screaming. They picked up the pace and saw many other equine figures running around as a strange worm-like creature with tentacles erupting from its mouth chased after them. The villagers seemed ill-equipped to defeat the monster, as it had a few blades and sharp instruments protruding from its scaled exterior.\n\nA monstrous roar, a cloud of dust left in its wake... it seemed like something from the Masnsih's old legends about the Sand Demon, only this beast was much, much smaller than the gargantuan dragon Jaddar knew of. Still, this thing was trying to kill the innocent, and Jaddar had not been made Surael's herald to sit idle in His mission.\n\nDespite exchanging no words, Jahorše seemed to know what must be done. "How shall we approach this, Jaddar?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.a: ""It is too formidable to defeat. We shall aid the villagers in their escape.""
 TBK_AF_event_start.4.b: ""If blades can pierce it, then so can my arrows. We shall fight it and drive it away.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.5.t: "Saviour"
 TBK_AF_event_start.5.d: "Today was not Light Bringer's day. Of course a tatzlwurm would attack her friend's village while she was visiting. Of course it would be a tiny one, making it far more agile than its full grown counterparts. Of course Light was the only unicorn in the area at the time. And of course she had left her gun at home.\n\nIt was all Light could do to hold the tatzlwurm's attention. She had barely dodged its tentacles thrice in quick succession, and her muscles were screaming in agony, letting her know that a fourth dodge attempt might be her last. She desperately fired meager magic bolts at the beast, but to no avail.\n\nShe really wished she was still in Tobuck.\n\nJust as the tatzlwurm was about to reach her again, she was roughly scooped up off of the ground and pulled away. In a daze, she looked to see what had grabbed her: some sort of... minotaur-thing with an arched nose and pointed ears? It wasn't quite the same, but it was seated on the back of a large, muscular horse. The unusual being glanced at her, then spoke with an exotic, yet commanding accent. "Are you okay?" She merely nodded, still shocked by the sudden appearance of her mysterious saviour.\n\nThe bipedal stranger set her down some distance away from the tatzlwurm. "Help gather the others. I shall lead the creature away." Definitely a male voice, Light noted.\n\nJust as quickly as he finished speaking, her new friend sped away on the back of his horse. Light had heard tell of abyssinian slave owners who rode ponies like that, but... this seemed different. These two were companions, she could tell.\n\nLight shook her head and gathered herself. Her assessment of this odd fellow could wait - he was out there trying to save her and the other villagers. She ran around and helped organize those she could find while the mysterious pair ran circles around the tatzlwurm. Eventually, it seemed to grow either tired or bored, for it gave up its pursuit and returned to the desert."
 TBK_AF_event_start.5.a: "Light didn't know who this guy was, but he had just saved her and the village."

 TBK_AF_event_start.6.t: "Saviour"

Her assessment of this odd fellow could wait - he was out there trying to save her and the other villagers. She ran around and helped organize those she could find while the bipedal fired arrow after arrow from atop the horse into the scales of the tatzl- wait, arrows? He was using a bow, of all things, instead of a gun or magic! Light suddenly felt inadequate, as the archer was so skilled that he drove several arrows into the cracks between the scales in quick succession. The tatzlwurm roared loudly in pain, dove back into the sand, then retreated from the pair that had injured it."
 TBK_AF_event_start.6.a: "Light didn't know who this guy was, but he had just saved her and the village."

 TBK_AF_event_start.7.t: "The Miracle"
 TBK_AF_event_start.7.d: "Somehow, despite the damage caused to the village, there were no fatalities. The local ponies and zebras began its reconstruction in earnest while Jaddar briefly rested against the side of a sandstone wall. Jahorše laid near him and was curiously staring at the smaller equines. Jaddar took a sip from his waterskin and contemplated today's events. Many strange things had happened, and he was still unsure of Surael's purpose in sending him here, or how he could best continue the fight against the Darkness.\n\n"I don't know what to make of this place and its people."\n\nJaddar's idle thoughts were halted by Jahorše's comment. Only now did he see just how fascinated Jahorše was by the villagers - not only were they sapient equines like him, but they had presumably lived their whole lives with full awareness of who they were. He reached over and rested his hand atop Jahorše's mane. "I see people unlike any I have seen before, and I see them living lives not entirely unfamiliar. I think, wherever we are, we will find friends. And perhaps with friends we can continue Surael's great work."\n\nThe two sat in comforting silence for some time before they heard a sharp cry from a ruined structure. Jaddar stood up to get a better look and then saw some villagers helping a zebra foal with a nasty gash on her torso. He reached into his pouch and verified he still had some medicinal herbs, then approached the injured zebra.\n\nThe villagers tentatively let Jaddar approach the foal, who proceeded to examine the gash. However, just as he touched the foal, he felt a strange power emanating from himself, the same as he had sensed earlier. It flowed from his hand into the foal, whose wound closed before his very eyes. Jaddar stared wide-eyed and examined his hand. Had he just used magic? And healing magic at that? He was no mage, and even then, that kind of magic was supposed to be impossible. There was no doubt in his mind now - Surael had sent him here and blessed him with great power to save this realm from the Malevolent Dark. "It's a miracle..." The villagers whispered as they crowded around him. The foal stood and bowed, thanking him for using his divine power to heal her.\n\nJaddar reached his hand out and lifted the foal's face back up to meet her eyes. "I am no god." He stood and looked at the crowd, who were still stunned by his healing abilities. "I am simply a messenger of Surael."\n\nAfter a brief moment, Light Bringer spoke up. "What is Surael?"\n\nJaddar felt pride as he began to teach a new flock. "He is the God of the Sun. He is our defender against the Malevolent Dark. He has granted me the power to spread his message to all, for all can be a part of the Light of Surael...""
 TBK_AF_event_start.7.a: "The villagers sat transfixed as Jaddar preached to them."

 TBK_AF_event_start.8.t: "With Friends Like These"
 TBK_AF_event_start.8.d: "Wallnut Drive had many friends. His drinking buddies, his military buddies, even Alesia and Baragzen weren't that bad... most of the time. However, one thing that all of his friends had in common was that they were equine, like him. Not that being a pony or zebra was a bad thing, but lately, Wallnut had been on the lookout for more exotic individuals to add to his circle of pals. That meant when one of his subordinates informed him of a "tall weirdo" performing miracles in a nearby village, he knew what to do: gather a small entourage and set off to meet this exotic fellow.\n\nUpon Wallnut's arrival in the village, the first thing he noticed was the crowd. Comprised mostly of zebras, it was hard to tell exactly how many were present, but the one they were gathered around was impossible to miss: a tall, bipedal creature who spoke with a commanding voice. He heard some phrases like "Sun god" and "Light", which meant he was likely the religious sort. No biggie, Wallnut thought, as long as he didn't worship Nightmare Moon!\n\nThe tall being spotted Wallnut's group and stopped his sermon. "Greetings," he said loudly, causing the crowd to turn their heads to Wallnut, "Have you come to hear the truth of Surael's Light and our mission to aid him in his war against the Malevolent Dark?"\n\nIt was then that Wallnut noticed another individual standing beside the creature: a very, very large horse. Much larger than any he'd seen before, and he'd met a saddle arabian! The horse was clad in barding and armor unlike any Wallnut had ever seen, with... was that a saddle on his back? Wallnut shook his head before he got further lost in tangential thoughts. "War against the dark? Buddy, I've been fightin' the darkness for years now," Wallnut laughed. "Can I ask your name?"\n\n"I am Jaddar Jexiszuir, the chosen Herald of Surael, the Sun God." Jaddar then gestured to his horse, "And this is my faithful companion, Jahorše, sixty-fourth of his name."\n\nWallnut began to approach the pair. He noticed Jahorše lock eyes with him, so he smiled and waved a hoof. After a moment, Jahorše waved back, though he did so with a strange stiffness in his gesture, like he was unused to moving his hoof like that. Hmm. Wallnut turned his gaze back to Jaddar. "Cool. So, Jaddar. Can I call ya Jadd? I know some real nasty folks who practically worship the darkness. They've been causin' me and a whole lotta other innocent people trouble. Wanna help me take 'em down?"\n\n"If what you say is true, then I shall gladly march with you. I can see by how your soldiers look at you that you are a respected military commander. May I have your name as well?""
 TBK_AF_event_start.8.a: "Wallnut reached a hoof out. "The name's Wallnut Drive. Always a pleasure to make new friends.""

 TBK_AF_event_start.9.t: "The Gun Runner's Unease"
 TBK_AF_event_start.9.d: "Pea Shooter sat in his office, absorbing the information on his desk. There were an ever-increasing number of reports of a new god appearing in the desert, though some conflicting accounts described the being as a prophet or a messenger instead. To Pea, the difference mattered little. He needed to keep this nuisance in check, otherwise, a rampantly growing religious fervor might spell an early end to his operations.\n\nHe examined a blurry photo of the creature in question. It looked almost like a minotaur, though instead of horns, it had pointed ears. Despite it being relatively mundane in appearance, Pea felt uneasy looking at the thing. He scoffed, then threw it in the trash. No matter. Wallnut may be missing, but the other warlords were still around and easily coercible. He'd send Alesia and Baragzen to take care of the creature, then he could return to business as usual.\n\nAlthough...\n\nPea glanced at the reports again. Nearly every settlement that this creature visited ended up joining its movement. If, no, when it arrived at Tobuck, there was a strong chance that...\n\nHe picked up his phone. He needed to offload as much money as possible into offshore accounts just in case his tenure in Tobuck was suddenly cut short by a zealot taking over the city. There was no doubt in his mind: Any sort of religious fellow would not look kindly upon the innumerable shady dealings he had taken to establish his money laundering scheme."
 TBK_AF_event_start.9.a: "Perhaps Pea Shooter might return home sooner than expected."

 TBK_AF_event_start.10.t: "With Even More Friends Like These"
 TBK_AF_event_start.10.d: ""Tell me, Wallnut," Jaddar asked as he and his growing following were heading to another nearby settlement, "This 'Chiropterra', they serve a god of darkness and nightmares, correct?"\n\n"Nightmare Moon, yep! Let me tell you: every rumor you hear about them is true. In fact, I used to live there! But I never liked 'em, so I ditched 'em and made their army look like buffoons! They sure like holding grudges, though, so now they want me and all my friends dead."\n\n"Then they shall serve as our first test," Jaddar stated with no doubt in his mind about the outcome of this inevitable conflict. He glanced behind him. Surael's blessing had gifted him with a new flock, and he had no intention of squandering this opportunity. He would unite this land and prepare them to face the Malevolent Dark, and after that... his thoughts drifted to his wife and daughter. If this place truly was another world, then he needed to find a way to return to them.\n\nWallnut's voice pierced his idle musing. "Hey, I see a group up ahead." Both of them squinted their eyes as they saw an equally sized group to theirs approaching them in the distance. After a moment, Wallnut perked up and grinned, "Oh hey, it's my buds!" He jumped up and waved in the air. "Alesia! Baragzen! Over here!"\n\nSoon, the two gatherings converged. There was some brief unease as Jaddar observed the opposing group moving like a military force. His unease turned to confusion as he could not spot their weapons. They had no swords, no archers, just long sticks with the occasional short blade attached at the end. Furthermore, their strange, boxy carriages seemed to be pulling themselves. As he was processing that, Wallnut wasted no time hopping over to speak to them. They were mostly zebras and "ponies," as Wallnut had informed him earlier. Apparently, "horses" were a distinctly different race. He would have to find one to compare to Jahorše later.\n\nThe two individuals that Wallnut was speaking to kept stealing curious glances at him. After a few minutes, all three of them turned to approach Jaddar. Wallnut put a hoof behind his head, "So uh, Alesia and Baragzen were sent here to, uh, kill you. But! They think Pea Shooter—that's our boss—is lying to them about you being a threat. I said that you're gonna help me put a stop to all the bad things happening around here, and they, uh, want some proof that you're actually a nice guy and capable and all that. Mind helping me out here?"\n\nJaddar nodded as he descended from Jahorše. His friend needed his help, and so he convinced them..."
 TBK_AF_event_start.10.a: "...of his divine powers by showing them the Light of Surael in his hands."
 TBK_AF_event_start.10.b: "...of his commanding presence by his precise and sharp movements."
 TBK_AF_event_start.10.c: "...of his grace and authority by giving an inspiring speech."

 TBK_AF_event_start.11.t: "United In Purpose"
 TBK_AF_event_start.11.d: "Truthfully, Light Bringer did not imagine herself becoming a motivational speaker and impromptu second-in-command for a religious movement. She was more the sort to rile up others about lousy fiction, but she supposed that appealing to the emotions and desires of her fans could be easily translated to what she now found herself doing. Which in this case was settling an argument between a civilian and one of Baragzen's mercenaries.\n\nThe two had been at it for some time, with the civilian claiming that Jaddar would finally save their homeland from corruption, while the mercenary insisted that Jaddar was merely assisting Baragzen in becoming lord over his rightful domain. Light Bringer soon settled this debacle by explaining that the two goals weren't mutually exclusive with one another. After all, Jaddar had said that there was a place for all under the Light of Surael. Though Light Bringer did have to clarify that she was not the Light of Surael, as some have misconstrued from her name.\n\nLight Bringer turned her gaze forward, looking past the marching columns of followers that had accumulated so quickly in such a short time. Leading them was of course Jaddar, who stared into the distant city of Tobuck with determination. Their next mission was to free that city from the false promises made by its fake president. Spirits were high, and all present could tell that once they secured the capital of this republic, great changes would occur in Tobuck, and perhaps Zebrica as a whole."
 TBK_AF_event_start.11.a: "And yet, what would those changes be?"
 
 TBK_AF_event_start.12.t: "The President's Due"
 TBK_AF_event_start.12.d: "The seizure of Tobuck turned out to be anti-climactic. Jaddar's forces were prepared to fight, yet little resistance was given to them. In fact, the city's residents seemed almost glad to see them. The capitol was the only place that had guards willing to fight, but in an almost miraculous display of negotiations, Jaddar convinced them to surrender rather than give up their lives for a president who did not value theirs.\n\nSaid president was missing from the capitol, however. Jaddar was about to organize a manhunt, but then inadvertently stumbled upon the stallion attempting to slip by his forces with a hooded cloak. Said stallion was quickly apprehended and stripped of his disguise.\n\n"I assure you, I was not trying to run," Pea Shooter lied through his teeth, "I often discreetly visit the marketplace to gauge how the common pony is handling my economic changes."\n\nJaddar dismounted from Jahorše, then knelt before the increasingly nervous-looking president. "Pea Shooter. You are a talented leader, in a sense. You know how to get others to do your bidding. You know just what to say and what to do to obtain the outcome you want." Jaddar paused, then looked at his surroundings. All who had accompanied him seemed eager to see what he would do to one who had attempted to have him killed. "And yet you show dishonesty before me. Before Surael. Why?"\n\nPea Shooter forced his best presidential smile and doubled down. "I have never been dishonest with anyone. I have always had the best interests of Tobuck and her citizens in my heart."\n\nJaddar was disappointed. This kind of creature was often incapable of banishing the Darkness from their heart. Normally, he would issue his standard ultimatum of "join or be banished" to such a creature, but the time he had spent with his new friends had given him another idea. He reached his hand forward and rested it atop Pea's shoulder. "Then you shall practice what you preach. You shall serve as my statesman and manage the ongoings of my empire while I spread the Light of Surael throughout this realm. I entrust this sacred task to you, and you shall be guarded to ensure your safety, as I suspect many will act against us."\n\nA brief expression of horror dawned on Pea Shooter's face as he realized he wouldn't be returning home to his wife and kids anytime soon. Jaddar paid this no mind and stood up to the cheers of his flock. This was a momentous accomplishment, but more trials yet remained."
