### FOCUS ### 

 ABY_AF_this_isnt_flusion:0 "This Isn't Flusion..."
 ABY_AF_this_isnt_flusion_desc:0 "Wherever this is, it isn't Flusion. Everything is strange, different and odd. Perhaps this is a chance to start afresh, with ripe clay for moulding."
 ABY_AF_but_their_technology:0 "...But their Technology..."
 ABY_AF_but_their_technology_desc:0 "Whilst the now-Katzen here do not have the technological might of Flusion, it is at least sufficient for the Kaiser to guide and begin a fresh conquest on unspoiled land."
 ABY_AF_and_their_powers:0 "...And Their Powers...." #Comma
 ABY_AF_and_their_powers_desc:0 "Something odd here sets this world far apart from old Flusion. By all known laws of physics, what passes for normal here should not be possible. Instead of raging at the inconsistency of it all, though, we can see the use of all this new... stuff. Magic, they call it."
 ABY_AF_are_worth_taking_over:0 "...Are Worth Taking Over!" #Comma
 ABY_AF_are_worth_taking_over_desc:0 "Abyssinia may just be the springboard the Kaiser needs for the path ahead: species that look just like him, political turmoil not so dissimilar from Flusion's, and populations who've clearly had no experience with someone who can read them like a book (and has read them a million times)."
 ABY_AF_kiloforges:0 "Build Kiloforges"
 ABY_AF_kiloforges_desc:0 "A sprinkling of Katzen know-how and a hefty dose of Katzen industrial might and things will start to get..interesting. Establishing of Kiloforges will help pump out the machinery of war for the Kaiser's plans."
 ABY_AF_the_trains_run_on_time:0 ""The Trains Run on Time""
 ABY_AF_the_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "In a long-forgotten cycle, a bunch of pizza-eaters revered this Beakolini-sound-alike figure who allegedly made the trains run on time. Unrelated to that, the Kaiser orbital-bombarded them, but everything working smoothly will be a miraculous turn-around for these battered cats."
 ABY_AF_the_sieger_project:0 "Towards the Sieger"
 ABY_AF_the_sieger_project_desc:0 ""The pitiable hunks of metal that pass for "armour" here will be a thing of the past. It may be too early to think of space-faring behemoths powered by entire solar systems, but the Kaiser's know-how can produce the next best thing with limited resources: a tank that screams "overlord".""
 ABY_AF_establish_production_lines:0 "Establish Foundries"
 ABY_AF_establish_production_lines_desc:0 "Whilst they may not be Kiloforges, a serious effort should be made to rip out surplus buildings and turn it into manufacturing forges. This will help alleviate some of the production demand."
 ABY_AF_project_two_the_tractor:0 "Project 2: The Katzen-Kampfpanzerr"
 ABY_AF_project_two_the_tractor_desc:0 "Close your eyes and imagine the thunder of wheels across these dunes. Behold an entire country blessed with the power of wheels. Every cat, a trucker—and they better be, if they are to keep up the pace."
 ABY_AF_every_kat_must_do_their_duty:0 "Every Kat Must Do Their Duty" #Nila
 ABY_AF_every_kat_must_do_their_duty_desc:0 "In Kattail's many cycles, he has found that many civilizations do not effectively use their populations in wartime. Why limit the fighting to just the adults? The more Kats in the military, the better. A bullet is deadly no matter who fires it and every able-bodied katzen who contributes to the war effort is essential."
 ABY_AF_the_mark_in_your_pocket:0 "The Mark in Your Pocket"
 ABY_AF_the_mark_in_your_pocket_desc:0 "Cities and villages alike will flood with money, both a promise of inconceivable prosperity and a sweetener to make the bitter reality of war go down once we walk into the rest of the world uninvited... and if they're worried about spending too much, the Kaiser's smile graces each coin, blessing every transaction."
 ABY_AF_katnological_marvels:0 "Katnological Marvels"
 ABY_AF_katnological_marvels_desc:0 "For Katzens nationwide, it is time to break the chains of ignorance. The Kaiser's great intellect has already shown, with primitive materials, what can be possible. Let's be optimists and discover what boundaries we can break when we innovate together."
 ABY_AF_thunderstorm_and_lightning:0 "Thunderstorm and Lightning"
 ABY_AF_thunderstorm_and_lightning_desc:0 "Whip everyone into a fervour! Frenzy, battle, fighting! A few speeches and some witty repartee will be more than enough to stoke the fires of conquest in the Kaiser's name."
 ABY_AF_very_very_frightening:0 "Very Very Frightening"
 ABY_AF_very_very_frightening_desc:0 "With catlike tread, our agents steal into the night, venting into foreign offices and snooping in on emergency meetings. Pretty soon, we'll have sleeper felines (and sleepy felines) embedded in every one of our neighbours, and they shall face the terror that is an agency's freakishly unpronounceable name."
 ABY_AF_i_have_a_dream:0 "I Have a Dream"
 ABY_AF_i_have_a_dream_desc:0 "The Abyssinia of old was limited by its lack of ambition. Every feline monarch past would've said "Impossible!" at the mere idea of a single continent under their rule. Kattail is the first cat to say never to never as his Katzens march to prove their ancestors wrong."
 ABY_AF_the_end_of_all:0 "The End of All Things"
 ABY_AF_the_end_of_all_desc:0 "The brilliant chessmaster that is Kaiser Kattail is at his best brooding over the next step to greatness. A cantankerous few might say it should be an easy stomp-fest, but Kattail has years, decades (centuries, even [millennia, even]) of experience to back up his striving for that one fool-proof offensive."
 ABY_AF_new_world_old_acquaintances:0 "New World, Old Acquaintances"
 ABY_AF_new_world_old_acquaintances_desc:0 "In nearly every iteration of Flusion, several friendly faces have popped up like universal constants in the Kaiser's rise to power. Although this Cycle seems highly irregular, those good old allies of his shall arrive to seize the day!... even if they just need some reminding about who they are."
 ABY_AF_let_loose_the_cries_of_war:0 "Let Loose the Cries of War" #Nila
 ABY_AF_let_loose_the_cries_of_war_desc:0 "We must not count days, we must not count miles, for we must count only the territories we gain and the numbers we stack against those who stand in our way. We must let loose the propaganda machine and push onward to victories waiting for us!"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sea:0 "Towards the Sea" #Nila
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sea_desc:0 "We have proven ourselves strong on land. Yet, we cannot hope to win further victories and gain more land if we cannot sail across the seas and oceans. Our sights must now turn to the lands beyond the shores of Zebrica."
 ABY_AF_exploit_the_oil:0 "Exploit the Oil" #Nila
 ABY_AF_exploit_the_oil_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of our new empire. If we wish to survive, then we must not waste the expertise of our citizens for nothing. Surveys and proper funding for oil extraction and processing must begin very soon."
 ABY_AF_modernized_work_programmes:0 "Modernized Work Programmes" #Nila
 ABY_AF_modernized_work_programmes_desc:0 "While it is nice to put our backs into our labor, it certainly would be nicer if we could invest in the equipment of our workforce and ensure that the projects we have are not backwards in thinking. Innovation, investments, and improvements should be the order of the day."
 ABY_AF_trade_with_the_worlds:0 "Integration of the Worthy" #Nila
 ABY_AF_trade_with_the_worlds_desc:0 "While we certainly can have some use for the creatures that we've absorbed through our conquests, it is vital that we carefully consider which of these are worthy of greater things. Integrating the more loyal and skilled would mean a much easier process of establishing our control and legitimacy over any new territories we have gained so far."
 ABY_AF_crack_the_lines:0 "Crack the Lines" #Nila
 ABY_AF_crack_the_lines_desc:0 "The feline body is not suited for the lightning war required to conquer the world. Luckily, Kattail knows of a certain crystal substance that may help. But using these crystals for defense is not something we can commit to all the time. We can't afford to put our troops through lengthy sieges or fancy maneuver operations. Our katzen must punch through the enemy lines and bite hard."
 ABY_AF_march_on_mages:0 "March on the Magocracy"
 ABY_AF_march_on_mages_desc:0 "This Maretania has the tools and artefacts needed to better utilise (or profane) this world's magic. Their whole gimmick of confining these entities away just won't do for eager conquerors: Putting them on the field will give them results far more accurate than any peer-reviewed study can produce."
 ABY_AF_project_three_claw_steel:0 "Project 3: Supertensile Blast Plates"
 ABY_AF_project_three_claw_steel_desc:0 "The old tanks were stop-gap measures. Some more Katzen know-how will make true machines of war! Afterall, there is no such thing as a tank that's too big."
 ABY_AF_the_vaults_are_open:0 "The Vaults are Open"
 ABY_AF_the_vaults_are_open_desc:0 "We might've breached containment a bit too much, given that we still need to look for where these artefacts are. Still, we've gathered that what these mages have been studying were of Aeternite origin, so no time to waste!"
 ABY_AF_enlighten_them:0 "Enlighten Them"
 ABY_AF_enlighten_them_desc:0 "The Kaiser pierces through the abyss of ignorance like a lantern. The blessings of his reign penetrates many minds, and they've borne further fruit: reading, available to all at your nearest public library!"
 ABY_AF_clock_is_ticking_kattail:0 "Clock is Ticking, Kattail!"
 ABY_AF_clock_is_ticking_kattail_desc:0 "Running an empire is like riding a bike, wherein momentum keeps you, well, moving. That, or some public vehicle rigged to explode if you go lower than a certain speed. Either way, such hyper-militarization does not come for free: the empire's maw must grow, lest it collapse under its sheer obesity."
 ABY_AF_victory_parades:0 "Victory Parades"
 ABY_AF_victory_parades_desc:0 "In a matter of months, we've accomplished what few, if any, have done. These cats, who've had nothing to aspire to before we arrived, have experienced joy after joy, achievement after achievement. Making official these celebrations will keep their thoughts away from the gargantuan need for yet more..."
 ABY_AF_katzenfication_take_one:0 "Begin Katzenfication Protocols"
 ABY_AF_katzenfication_take_one_desc:0 "We are not club-wielding brutes, despite our rivals' slander. The Katzens' long history with and admiration for war has turned the affair into a rejuvenating, civilising force... a zeitgeist this planet's cats (and otherwise) are not used to yet but will happily adopt. When the Imperium strings along victory after victory, everyone will want to be a Katzen!"
 ABY_AF_the_zebtropa_plan:0 "The Zebtropa Plan"
 ABY_AF_the_zebtropa_plan_desc:0 "It's a few centuries too early for water cities, so let's settle for second-best: a dam to drain the Arabian Sea and reveal new lands for settlement and industry. A massive diplomatic power play, to be sure, though the details are rather top secret."
 ABY_AF_a_grand_gesture:0 "A Grand Gesture"
 ABY_AF_a_grand_gesture_desc:0 "From sea to shining sea? Not exactly, but the Kaiser has done a great deal in such short time. This world's power blocs will surely realise that the Katzens are here to stay. They will surely bring their best.\n\nBring it."
 ABY_AF_continental_ambitions:0 "Continental Ambitions"
 ABY_AF_continental_ambitions_desc:0 "An empire's first obstacle is distance, the bane of every ruler's desires, from levying armies to nabbing taxes. Roads and rail may be kindergarten to the Kaiser, but he knows their necessity in cementing the Imperium's gains."
 ABY_AF_along_the_sea:0 "Along the Sea"
 ABY_AF_along_the_sea_desc:0 "From the Zarantian dunes where spices and other exotics flow to the suspiciously similar pyramids of the suspiciously named Maregypt, there is a lot of valuable coastland (that isn't desert). They're ripe to be the staging of more serious campaigns."
 ABY_AF_the_capable_hippogriffs:0 "The Capable Hippogriffs"
 ABY_AF_the_capable_hippogriffs_desc:0 "Across the strait lies the proud islands of Hippogriffia, whose natives pose a real threat of combined naval and aerial operations by virtue of shapeshifting from winged horses to seahorses. However, any challenge is a good challenge, and soon, they'll collectively transform from alive to dead."
 ABY_AF_the_road_ahead:0 "The Road Ahead"
 ABY_AF_the_road_ahead_desc:0 "What stands between the Imperium and the other two landmasses with their envious eyes are the seas. These deep waters will inevitably be our bridge to the rest of the planet, though before we can mount a magnanimous landing force, we require the fleet to match. Let's re-orient several city-wide factory districts this way..."
 ABY_AF_cleaning_up_stragglers:0 "Cleaning up Stragglers"
 ABY_AF_cleaning_up_stragglers_desc:0 "North-east Zebrica is nearly ours. There is but one civilisation left to challenge: Colthage, a (probably) not-so-stable republic with quite the corrupt and nepotist recent history. Whatever ails it now, the future cadaver of Zonicia's pride will make for a fine souvenir."
 ABY_AF_the_queen_over_the_water:0 "The Queen over the Water"
 ABY_AF_the_queen_over_the_water_desc:0 "Without fear or apology, the Katzen Navy shall stand supreme. The beaked fish people across the channels will receive our heavily armed courtesy calls. They can either submerge themselves into their graves or surrender to keep their aquatic homes intact."
 ABY_AF_downfall:0 "Downfall"
 ABY_AF_downfall_desc:0 "The fickle shapeshifters have continued to evade us, but while the local Katzen might not've had much experience fighting them, the Kaiser's wisdom knows no bounds. If it's a slog they want, it's a slog they'll get. Those sapient flying seafoods will purchase each day of survival with costly pounds of flesh."
 ABY_AF_cracking_open_the_mountain:0 "Cracking Open the Mountain"
 ABY_AF_cracking_open_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mount Aris has fallen, and millions must submit. For a country that has only recently recovered from battling the Storm King, they went mad with prosperity. A sizeable minority even wanted to leave the world alone, such isolating debauchery. They and their wealth will not be spared from the Katzen war machine."
 ABY_AF_a_curious_specimen:0 "A Curious Specimen"
 ABY_AF_a_curious_specimen_desc:0 "From the ashes of Hippogriffia, a peculiar seapony has made herself known to us. This "Posada" has quickly established herself as no mere socialist, with ideas verging on the whimsical. Then again, the Kaiser himself will be called whimserical if he were to speak of all he's seen in his life. Posada may have her uses, then."
 ABY_AF_a_curious_proposal:0 "A Curious Proposal"
 ABY_AF_a_curious_proposal_desc:0 "Blueprints and schematics galore spill from Posada's brain. Kattail has seen them in so many Cycles before, but not so many for the quadruped or the fishy form. Plus, this seapony does want to study our advanced machines to satiate her fascination with the future. Let's give her something extra for her time."
 ABY_AF_floating_fortresses:0 "Floating Fortresses"
 ABY_AF_floating_fortresses_desc:0 "Our diplomacy is of the gunboat variety, and it's about time we take that seriously. Across the three continents, dreadnoughts and destroyers of diverse countries will bow to the true titans of the sea, hulking with hideous strength. They may even spread rumours that they're a kilometre long!"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sky:0 "Towards the Sky"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sky_desc:0 "Way down south in the land of raiders, former slaves, and Storm King traitors, we ride away to a writhing mass of laker. Scarred by the yetis' warpath, they'll be a nice sideshow for our itchy paws."
 ABY_AF_the_inventive_yetis:0 "The Inventive Yetis"
 ABY_AF_the_inventive_yetis_desc:0 "Much of the world is composed of quadruped creatures, so a species with opposable thumbs poses problems. Or they would've if we were not bipedal thumb-users ourselves. The weapons and vehicles they've left behind for the poor zebras to use don't have to be refit to our forms, for one."
 ABY_AF_through_the_mountains:0 "Through the Mountains"
 ABY_AF_through_the_mountains_desc:0 "The zebras of the Great Lakes barely have had time to unshackle themselves from the yeti yoke to fend themselves against the terrors in the sky. Their antiquated scrap metal on wings will fall to our highly coordinated swarms. The zebras will have no time to breathe."
 ABY_AF_the_path_beyond:0 "The Path Beyond"
 ABY_AF_the_path_beyond_desc:0 "Entire regions can be iterated and re-iterated upon, made incredibly efficient. The Imperium does not yet have the technology to convert the entire planet into a giant manufacturing centre, but we've captured enough land to sow the seeds for that outcome."
 ABY_AF_march_straight_onwards:0 "March Straight Onwards" #Comma
 ABY_AF_march_straight_onwards_desc:0 "From great lakes to inclement weather, we've entered the yeti heartland. Treacherous mountains and inhospitable storms make for less than ideal conditions, but Kattail has mastered terrain far above the troposphere. Tacking on "storm" into their names will yield the yetis and their thralls nothing."
 ABY_AF_ten_minutes_of_revenge:0 "Ten Minutes of Revenge" #Comma
 ABY_AF_ten_minutes_of_revenge_desc:0 "Call revanchism for what it is, but what once was Abyssinia has clawed its way to the Storm King's homeland. Only humiliation is what the worst of these despoilers deserve, while the rest will have their geniuses harnessed. Our proud felines will get the justice they need, starting with a few... renovations."
 ABY_AF_the_flying_fortress:0 "The Flying Fortress"
 ABY_AF_the_flying_fortress_desc:0 "Whilst the stars may elude Katzen-kind here, that does not mean that we cannot metaphorically stretch our wings and wreak havoc from the skies once more. Massive payloads of crippling, destructive bombs will help pave the way."
 ABY_AF_applied_avionics:0 "Applied Avionics"
 ABY_AF_applied_avionics_desc:0 "The Kaiser has put great emphasis on technological advancement for all Katzen, and the notion of detection electronics will give a suitable edge - as well as protecting our airforce."

 ABY_AF_flying_carriers_desc:0 ""
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sturmer:0 "Towards the Sturmer"
 ABY_AF_towards_the_sturmer_desc:0 "Great powerful guns and rolling thunder will, in unison, deliver a one-two punch of demoralising and destructive might to the foes of all katzen. If the Kaiser wills it, so must it be. Advanced blueprints have been drawn for a new weapon of war - The Sturmer."
 ABY_AF_nuclear_is_always_an_option:0 "Nuclear is ALWAYS an Option"
 ABY_AF_nuclear_is_always_an_option_desc:0 "The Kaiser's keen intellect and knowledge of advanced katzen technology means that there can be a significant jump in power generation - and weaponisation. His insights into technology previously thought beyond us will give us great assistance in the war."

Yet, we must be ready to unleash our armies against the creatures there, defeating them so we can utilize their populations as well as exploit the very resources we seek.

### EVENTS ###

katzen_AF.1.t:0 "A Wrong Turn"
katzen_AF.1.d:0 "Another defeat at the hand of rival galactic powers, another collapsing Imperium, another storming of Katown and the Pyramid... another failed attempt. It mattered little in the end, Kattail thought, as he barreled through eternity and unto the next iteration of the Infinite Cycle, where he knew that another Flusion and its billions of zealous Katzens would be waiting for him to arrive and retry everything once more.\n\nKattail found himself in a cave, presumably somewhere near Katown. As he got up to exit the cave and restart his conquests, he felt... heavier than usual. How strange, had he put on weight since the last Cycle? No matter, he thought, as he walked out of the cave, expecting to be greeted by the familiar sight of the suburban outskirts of the Katown megalopolis.\n\nHowever, Katown was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the lukewarm and verdant plains of the Northern Katzen Herzlands. Instead, in front of him stretched a large, arid plain beneath a scorching, nearly-equatorial sun. There was no megalopolis in sight, only scattered and evidently rather poor villages surrounding a moderately large city in the distance.\n\nPerhaps he had arrived too early, back when Flusion was warmer? Or maybe this Flusion was simply different from the rest... or perhaps, he thought, as he stared at the rustic villages, strangely bereft of all the usual aspects of Katzen militarization..."
katzen_AF.1.a:0 "...this wasn't Flusion at all!"
katzen_AF.2.t:0 "Under the Gaslight"
katzen_AF.2.d:0 "The tall, orange-furred Katzen was sitting in a nice, comfy room, alongside none other than Kaiser Kattail himself. He wasn't too sure why he was there other than that he had been selected for a so-called "Destiny Realization Program' based on his military leadership skills, academic studies, and, strangely enough, his appearance.\n\n"So.' the Kaiser spoke in a soft yet assertive voice. "Tell me. What is it that you like to do?'\n"Well... um... is this a date...?'\n"No, but I like that way of thinking. Carry on...'\n"Well I of course like a good military campaign, yes.'\n"Excellent. And do you yearn for the great beyond?'\n"I think I do yes, although I never really got the opportunity to really dive into what it actually is.'\n"Have you ever dreamed of piloting the moon?'\n"What?'\n"Well, have you?' the Kaiser said with an overtly serious tone in stark contrast with the question he had just asked.\n"Thinking about it... I think I did, when I was 6 or 7, yes. I was flying the moon with some giant cannon on it... it was pretty neat.'\nThe Kaiser's eyes brightened as the Katzen spoke. "Excellent. Then, I believe you've passed the test.'\n"Cool. What do I get?'\n"You get a new name.'\n"Pardon me?'\n"From now on, you are now Douclaw MacCathur, Grand General of the Katzenartig Imperium's armed forces. Do you accept?'\n"Douclaw MacCathur... that's a funny name. But, well, you're the Kaiser, so, sure... I suppose! Do I... really need the name, though?'\n"It is absolutely essential. Now, let's discuss tactics, shall we? You've got a lot to catch up on...'"
katzen_AF.2.a:0 "Hopefully Loris, Pawtton, and Meolson will be this simple."

katzen_AF.21.t:0 "Investigating the Magic"
katzen_AF.21.d:0 "At first, Kattail of course thought of simply departing from this Cycle. What was he to do without his trusty Katzens? And yet, this curious anomaly intrigued him, thus he set out to learn more about this strange world.\n\nWandering about the arid countryside, he quickly noticed that, while they weren't Katzens, the inhabitants of the area he landed in were most definitely feline, which made it surprisingly easy for him to get chummy with them and subsequently extract valuable information under the pretense of him being a wealthy Abyssinian expat returning to his homeland...\n\nIn a strange parallel with what's usually happening on Flusion during his arrival, he learned that these felines too were embroiled in political instability and stagnation, with many of them yearning for a proper regime change.\n\nBut the most interesting part to him had to be the wide variety of magical abilities reportedly displayed by the various species populating this world which, much like Flusion, was strangely rich and diverse. He eventually concluded that, while it would be a brazen departure from his habits, this world had...certain potential, when it came to furthering his ambitions.\n\nIn the end, maybe all that his grand plans of universal domination needed to finally succeed were merely... a little bit of magic."
katzen_AF.21.a:0 "And so his mind was set."


katzen_AF.22.t:0 "The New Imperium"
katzen_AF.22.d:0 "The actual takeover of "Abyssinia' was, for lack of better terms, relatively mundane. The skillful usage of his immense technological and political knowledge from past Cycles made it easy for Kattail to rapidly gather a large following across the nation, which promptly marched onto the capital of Panthera. Of course, some false promises and manipulation had to be undertaken, but the repercussions of that would be dealt with in due time.\n\nNaturally, Kattail still expected [ABY.GetLeader] to resist and cause a civil war, but, much to his surprise, as he stepped into [ABY.GetLeader]'s palace and confronted him in person, the monarch quite simply stared at Kattail, before handing him the crown, seemingly almost... happy, to do so. And well, that was that. After generously allowing [ABY.GetLeader] to retire in a rural cottage, Kattail now found himself at the head of Abyssinia and its six million inhabitants.\n\nBut it was evident that this was only the beginning as the nation he had managed to take over was... not in the best of shapes, to say the least. Devastated by the Storm King, plagued by slave unrest, and threatened by Wingbardy's ambitions, Kattail knew that he'd need to put in quite a bit of elbow grease if he was to make any of it work."
katzen_AF.22.a:0 "An ocean of elbow grease, really."

katzen_AF.23.t:0 "The New Imperium"
katzen_AF.23.d:0 "Tailbeba Mewda sat in a seemingly endless line of Abyssinians, all waiting to get into a so-called "Katzenification Office', dozens of which had recently been erected across Abyssinia by Kaiser Kattail.\n\nHaving been little more than a laborer all his life, he wasn't too sure what to expect and frankly hoped that this would be little more than a formality. After his livelihood was devastated by the Storm King's plundering, he had just barely managed to rebuild his life to an extent that he deemed acceptable and thus really didn't want to lose everything to the whims of some megalomaniac leader again.\n\n"Name, age, occupation, skills, ambitions?' The Katzen at the office's counter asked gruffly, snapping Tailbeba out of his thoughts.\n\n"Tailbeba Mewda, 37, laborer, hm, laboring, I guess? I did a bit of military training in my youth but nothing else... and...' Ambitions? That's an odd question, he thought. "...uuh... to travel the world, I suppose? I... never got the opportunity, being a peasant and all.'\n\n"Excellent. Then you're being assigned to the 1st Katzenkorps which is to be the Kaiser's finest. Forget about your peasantries though, the Kaiser will need the full potential of fresh Katzens like you if his visions are to be realized. As per the Katzenification Decree, you shall henceforth be known as Gustav Mewbert, proud Katzen of Katzennia,' the Katzen said, handing "Gustav' some papers and a freshly stamped ID.\n\n"Well, welcome to your new life! You may now proceed.' announced the clerk as the advancing line already pushed the confused Gustav out of the office."
katzen_AF.23.a:0 "They'll get used to it."

katzen_AF.24.t:0 "To Drain a Sea"
katzen_AF.24.d:0 ""A... dam?', the lead engineer uttered in confusion to Kattail.\n\n"Yes, indeed. A dam! A big, beautiful dam, stretching from Cemareta to Jabal Tailiq which we have recently seized. Built out of the finest Katzen concrete and steel.' Kattail said triumphantly.\n\n"But... but why?'\n\n"I'm glad you asked. Well, it will hold back the ocean itself and allow for the reclamation of hundreds of square kilometers of land from the Arabian sea. A network of canals will keep former cities connected to the sea while we'll later be able to redirect the evaporated water to irrigate the Zebhara and turn it into something actually useful for our purposes.'\n\nDumbfounded, the head engineer thought for a bit. He and everyone else knew that this Kattail was a megalomaniac, but to dry a sea was a whole new level of insanity, really. "We'll... we'll need some time to think about the schematics, Herr Kai-'\n\n"Ah, the schematics, do not fret! I've got a few leads.' Kattail said as he pulled out a thick pile of paper from a suitcase before setting it down in front of the engineers. "I've done some of the preliminary thinking by myself, you should find that most of the math checks out, we just need sufficient industrial capability and it should all work out.'\n\nOf course, he could have provided the full schematics, but that would have been a bit too... suspicious. And besides, letting them fill in the blanks was a good test of their competence, Kattail thought as he watched his engineers trying to make sense of the plans..."
katzen_AF.24.a:0 "... the symbol of the new order."

katzen_AF.25.b:0 "shoot at it"
katzen_AF.25.c:0 "talk to it"

katzen_AF.26.t:0 "Kattail Ad Aeternum"
katzen_AF.26.d:0 "Kattail, alongside his escort, strutted through the vast vaults of The Cave. Most of the artifacts stored there, while interesting in their own right, were mostly curiosities of little actual value for his plans.\n\nThey would thus be allowed to remain there with oversight from Katzen scientists who would be working with the Obsidian Council, whom promises of funding and cooperation had managed to sway to his side, in order to ensure the continued security and study of these magical trinkets.\n\nSome of the artifacts were far more dangerous, but also much more interesting. These would be studied extensively in order to bolster the Imperium's still lackluster science base, in a final bid to finally drag the Abyssinians out of the mud of technological backwardness which had impeded the Kaiser's conquest for too long.\n\nBut the Kaiser soon came face to face with what was perhaps The Cave's most important item. A large resplendent artifact from ages past, gleaming with ethereal purple energy, whose visible age only made it all the more enthralling.\n\nIt seemed as if it was of near-infinite complexity, orders of magnitude beyond what the people of this planet could have ever produced in their entire history. To everyone, its origins remained shrouded in mystery, with many believing it to be divine in origin, a construct perhaps forged by Boreas himself.\n\nBut to Kattail, the answer was obvious: the item's creator was none other than Aeternum, the galactic core's ancient precursor civilization. It seemed that, just as they had tempered with Flusion, so had they also tempered with this world and its people. Thus, so many more of these artifacts were almost certainly scattered throughout the planet.\n\nAnd Kattail intended to find each and every single one of them."
katzen_AF.26.a:0 "The treasures of the past shall fuel the wonders of the future."

katzen_AF.27.t:0 "Deluge"
katzen_AF.27.d:0 "Alongside her caravan, Idir Ameziane was trekking through the harsh landscape of the deep Zebhara. Sand, sand, sand, as far as the eye could see, pretty much the only sight she had seen during her entire life.\n\nThere had been hints of change, though. Reportedly, the region had fallen under the control of a certain "Kaiser Kattail", and every so often she spotted some railway or settlement being built in the distance, a distance which she preferred to keep as she didn't mind her lifestyle all that much.\n\nShe had her spot within her community; that was all she needed. Besides, whoever that Kaiser fellow was, he likely didn't care much for a few nomads in the sand, she thought. While tall felines clad in strange attires occasionally approached her with "job opportunities", she always declined and it seemed to be keeping change at bay.\n\nUntil it started raining. "Tis the annual rainfall", the elders said. "It will end soon.", except it, of course, did not end. Drizzle turned into rainfall washing over the Zebhara as the desert's oasis swelled into gargantuan lakes, often swallowing entire heritage sites beneath the waves in the process.\n\nIdir barely had any time to process these changes before a flurry of gargantuan tracked construction vehicles began tearing the desert asunder with a vast network of canals, followed by wave upon wave of eager settlers planting forests, building cities, and constructing solar panel networks in the vast expanses where her people used to roam.\n\nShe eventually found herself having to join these settlers if she was to carve herself a spot in this strange new world, but not without swearing to never forget the sight of the beautiful white sand glistening in the sun. \n\nIt was all she had left from her world."
katzen_AF.27.a:0 "The tides of change engulf all."

katzen_AF.271.t:0 "Planning Away"
katzen_AF.271.d:0 "Tailbeba, or Gustav as he was now called, sat alongside many other Abyssinians in a large newly-erected building in Panth... Katown, which the Kaiser humbly dubbed the Kattail Military Academy.\n\nMuch like the recruitment office that had dragged him into this strange new life, many of these had popped up throughout the nation, often within the same buildings as the office, all with the supposed goal of preparing the populace for the "upcoming trials', whatever that meant.\n\nHowever, perhaps due to Abyssinia's rather crippling lack of modern military masterminds, Gustav and many hundred if not thousands of Abyssinians were listening to none other than Kaiser Kattail himself speak about his plans for the nation, with his speech being relayed to the other academies via radio.\n\nFor hours and hours, Kattail went on about a vast variety of subjects, ranging from new-era military doctrines involving armored vehicles to societal transformation and new exciting technologies to be implemented across Abyssinia.\n\nGustav emerged out of the lecture feeling overwhelmed by it all, and so he sat down in a large park next to the building to allow his laborer mind to process the vast amount of information he had just been given. He just sat there, taking in everything, when his thoughts were, once again, interrupted by the sudden sound of someone else's voice.\n\n"Pretty nifty speech, huh?' a black-furred Katzen clad in an impeccable military outfit addressed him. "You look a tad lost. The name's... Hans. Used to be Yelekai but I'll admit that Hans has a nice ring to it. What's yours?'"
katzen_AF.271.a:0 "Mine is... Gustav, yes. Gustav."

katzen_AF.272.t:0 "A Friendly Face"
katzen_AF.272.d:0 ""I'm sorry I'm just a bit... you know... lost, by this whole thing.'\n\n"That's understandable! I used to be some lowly laborer before this, so getting all these opportunities is nothing short of refreshing. Incredible how Kattail is making it all work, huh?'\n\n"I... used to be a laborer too... I didn't mind it too much, admittedly. Although the Storm King really messed everything up and I had to start nearly from scratch rebuilding everything.'\n\n"Ah! The Storm King! Didn't you hear? The Kaiser said that we'd make the Yetis pay back what they inflicted upon us a thousand times. Isn't that sweet? Frankly, I just want to do something more with my life than till soil until I become soil myself if you catch my gist.'\n\n"That's... one way of looking at it, I suppose?' Gustav said, staring into the distance where many Abyssinians and numerous freed slaves were busy working on construction projects... prompting Gustav to think about the way Kattail had somehow managed to do so much for Abyssinian society in so little time. Perhaps Hans was right to be excited? Yet he couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all moving far too fast. All it'd take is one mistake...\n\n"Not very chatty, are we? Well, the Kaiser said it was important to develop a sense of camaraderie between Katzens, so, want to be friends?'\n\nGustav looked up, having almost forgotten about Hans' presence already. "Oh? Friends? Friends... friends. Sure. Let's be friends, it... can't hurt, really.' Gustav said in a low voice. Having lived a somewhat lonely life in rural Abyssinia for most of his life, he wasn't really used to talking with complete strangers like that, especially such overtly ambitious ones, but he figured he'd give it a shot anyway. If anything, maybe it'd help him fit in better.\n\nAfter all, he had already rebuilt his life from scratch once, what's a second time?"
katzen_AF.272.a:0 "Mine is... Gustav, yes. Gustav."

katzen_AF.273.t:0 "A Friendly Face"
katzen_AF.273.d:0 "Assur, Anseruk, Mane'a, Mareib, Trotgiers, Gallarb,... dozens of other major cities had fallen under Katzennia's dominion, and Kattail could not be prouder of his soldiers. Under his guidance, they marched from the arid plains of Abyssinia, through the fertile shores of the Arabian Sea, all the way to Cape Hestraya and beyond to the South Pole, swelling his empire from just Abyssinia to a monstrous superstate engulfing a large chunk of western Zebrica.\n\nThis, of course, warranted celebration. Across the newly captured cities of Katzennia, columns of KK-Panzers followed by hundreds if not thousands of foot soldiers paraded down avenues and boulevards. Much to Kattail's delight, these cohorts were made up not only of Abyssinians but also a myriad of other species that had stopped seeing the Katzens as invaders but rather as allies worthy of their cooperation.\n\nAnd yet, watching the largest of the parades from atop a balcony in Katown, he knew this was nowhere near enough. All across his new empire countless partisans and freedom fighters were already arraying themselves against his rule and that of the Katzens.\n\nThese would have to be stamped out quickly before the problem grew out of control, he thought, as he began working to establish proper integration protocols and widespread counter-insurgency tactics with his intelligence agency, to ensure his empire was ready to weather the incoming storm about to be unleashed upon it.\n\nAs indeed! To many external observers, Abyssinia has gone far, far beyond the nation's wildest dreams, and was surely satisfied with its new conquests. But to Kattail, this was only the very, very beginning of his great journey across this world. Soon, the Hippogriffs and the Yetis would fall, followed by the rest of the continent, and then, the world.\n\nBut for now? It was time to enjoy the parades, and despite having seen such parades thousands if not millions of times by now... they never got old."
katzen_AF.273.a:0 "Step by step..."


katzen_AF.28.t:0 "Dominance"
katzen_AF.28.d:0 "At last, it is complete. Likely the greatest feat of engineering in the world, perhaps in all of history, has been realized according to Kattail's grand plan, as indeed, the almighty Riesigerkatzenpanzer is now operational.\n\nFive hundred meters in length, two hundred meters tall, and weighing over three hundred and fifty thousand tons, it is to be the ultimate manifestation of Katzen dominance. Its gigantic Bergbrecher tracks, powered by dozens of nuclear reactors embedded into the vehicle's fortified innards, make the very ground tremble as the vehicle rolls out of its gargantuan construction yards near the outskirts of Katown.\n\nAs is to be expected for such a vehicle, it features hundreds of cannons, aimed at laying waste to enemy infantry, armor, and aircraft alike, all while remaining nearly indestructible thanks to its meter-thick armor. It is estimated that it will cost four hundred million Katzmarks to fire this weapon for twelve seconds.\n\nAnd yet all of these pale in comparison to the vehicle's most powerful asset: the almighty Kontinentale Sturmer. This fearsome weapon is capable of lobbing a shell consisting of seven thermonuclear warheads at any point on the planet, tearing the sky and land asunder and bringing devastation upon our foes like a mechanical angel of death. Kattail is hopeful that we will never, ever have to fire it.\n\nThe vehicle, which has now been dubbed "Dominiontracks', as well as its crew of fifteen thousand loyal Katzens, is now awaiting orders near Katown. Should we wish to incinerate a state in nuclear hellfire, we may now do so."
katzen_AF.28.a:0 "The world shall bend."

katzen_AF.29.t:0 "To Tear the World Asunder"
katzen_AF.29.d:0 "With its target being confirmed, and the order being officially given to fire, Kattail and the High Command proceed with the last authorizations before the Riesigerkatzenpanzer can begin its act. The Kontinentale Sturmer is ready, and within minutes, the railgun, over 150 meters in length by itself, fires.\n\nA massive explosion follows the projectile, the sabot shell being twenty meters itself at the largest, as it screams across the sky. The immense force of the Sturmer bends the land surrounding it as trees lean backward in the wake of the sonic boom as the shell flies high into the sky, rupturing the cloud layer in mere seconds and vanishing from sight.\n\nBut it doesn't take long for it to return. Within mere minutes the shell climbs to its apogee, thousands of kilometers into the heavens themselves, before turning around and detonating its propulsive nuclear charges in rapid succession. This accelerates it to tens of thousands of kilometers per second before its fairing separates, revealing its seven thermonuclear warheads.\n\nThe warheads puncture through the atmosphere in less than two seconds before detonating with full force over [From.From.GetName]. In the blink of an eye the fury of seven suns tears apart the landscape, setting plains alight and turning entire woodlands into little more than tinder for the flames, while any rivers in the vicinity are near-instantly flash-boiled as millions of tons of water evaporate into superheated steam.\n\nAny enemy forces or military installations in the area are essentially removed from existence before they are allowed to react. Meanwhile, the sound of the explosion is heard several times everywhere as it circles the planet several times over like a testimony to the wrath of the Katzenartig Imperium sent to the entire world.\n\nAs Kattail watches everything unfold, he hopes that this warning shot will suffice."
katzen_AF.29.a: "Maar cackles."
