katzen_AF.1.d:0 "Another defeat at the hand of rival galactic powers, another collapsing Imperium, another storming of Katown and the Pyramid... another failed attempt. It mattered little in the end, Kattail thought, as he barreled through eternity and unto the next iteration of the Infinite Cycle, where he knew that another Flusion and its billions of zealous Katzens would be waiting for him to arrive and retry everything once more.\n\nKattail found himself in a cave, presumably somewhere near Katown. As he got up to exit the cave and restart his conquests, he felt... heavier than usual. How strange, had he put on weight since the last Cycle? No matter, he thought, as he walked out of the cave, expecting to be greeted by the familiar sight of the suburban outskirts of the Katown megalopolis.\n\nHowever, Katown was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the lukewarm and verdant plains of the Northern Katzen Herzlands. Instead, in front of him stretched a large, arid plain beneath a scorching, nearly-equatorial sun. There was no megalopolis in sight, only scattered and evidently rather poor villages surrounding a moderately large city in the distance.\n\nPerhaps he had arrived too early, back when Flusion was warmer? Or maybe this Flusion was simply different from the rest... or perhaps, he thought, as he stared at the rustic villages, strangely bereft of all the usual aspects of Katzen militarization..."
katzen_AF.1.a:0 "...this wasn't Flusion at all!"
katzen_AF.2.t:0 "Under the Gaslight"
katzen_AF.2.d:0 "The tall, orange-furred Katzen was sitting in a nice, comfy room, alongside none other than Kaiser Kattail himself. He wasn't too sure why he was there other than that he had been selected for a so-called “Destiny Realization Program” based on his military leadership skills, academic studies, and, strangely enough, his appearance.\n\n“So.” the Kaiser spoke in a soft yet assertive voice. “Tell me. What is it that you like to do?”\n“Well... um... is this a date...?”\n“No, but I like that way of thinking. Carry on...”\n“Well I of course like a good military campaign, yes.”\n“Excellent. And do you yearn for the great beyond?”\n“I think I do yes, although I never really got the opportunity to really dive into what it actually is.”\n“Have you ever dreamed of piloting the moon?”\n“What?”\n“Well, have you?” the Kaiser said with an overtly serious tone in stark contrast with the question he had just asked.\n“Thinking about it... I think I did, when I was 6 or 7, yes. I was flying the moon with some giant cannon on it... it was pretty neat.”\nThe Kaiser's eyes brightened as the Katzen spoke. “Excellent. Then, I believe you've passed the test.”\n“Cool. What do I get?”\n“You get a new name.”\n“Pardon me?”\n“From now on, you are now Douclaw MacCathur, Grand General of the Katzenartig Imperium's armed forces. Do you accept?”\n“Douclaw MacCathur... that's a funny name. But, well, you're the Kaiser, so, sure... I suppose! Do I... really need the name, though?”\n“It is absolutely essential. Now, let's discuss tactics, shall we? You've got a lot to catch up on...”"
katzen_AF.2.a:0 "Hopefully Loris, Pawtton, and Meolson will be this simple."

katzen_AF.21.t:0 "Investigating the Magic"
katzen_AF.21.d:0 "At first, Kattail of course thought of simply departing from this Cycle. What was he to do without his trusty Katzens? And yet, this curious anomaly intrigued him, thus he set out to learn more about this strange world.\n\nWandering about the arid countryside, he quickly noticed that, while they weren't Katzens, the inhabitants of the area he landed in were most definitely feline, which made it surprisingly easy for him to get chummy with them and subsequently extract valuable information under the pretense of him being a wealthy Abyssinian expat returning to his homeland...\n\nIn a strange parallel with what's usually happening on Flusion during his arrival, he learned that these felines too were embroiled in political instability and stagnation, with many of them yearning for a proper regime change.\n\nBut the most interesting part to him had to be the wide variety of magical abilities reportedly displayed by the various species populating this world which, much like Flusion, was strangely rich and diverse. He eventually concluded that, while it would be a brazen departure from his habits, this world had...certain potential, when it came to furthering his ambitions.\n\nIn the end, maybe all that his grand plans of universal domination needed to finally succeed were merely... a little bit of magic."
katzen_AF.21.a:0 "And so his mind was set."


katzen_AF.22.t:0 "The New Imperium"
katzen_AF.22.d:0 "The actual takeover of “Abyssinia” was, for lack of better terms, relatively mundane. The skillful usage of his immense technological and political knowledge from past Cycles made it easy for Kattail to rapidly gather a large following across the nation, which promptly marched onto the capital of Panthera. Of course, some false promises and manipulation had to be undertaken, but the repercussions of that would be dealt with in due time.\n\nNaturally, Kattail still expected [ABY.GetLeader] to resist and cause a civil war, but, much to his surprise, as he stepped into [ABY.GetLeader]'s palace and confronted him in person, the monarch quite simply stared at Kattail, before handing him the crown, seemingly almost... happy, to do so. And well, that was that. After generously allowing [ABY.GetLeader] to retire in a rural cottage, Kattail now found himself at the head of Abyssinia and its six million inhabitants.\n\nBut it was evident that this was only the beginning as the nation he had managed to take over was... not in the best of shapes, to say the least. Devastated by the Storm King, plagued by slave unrest, and threatened by Wingbardy's ambitions, Kattail knew that he'd need to put in quite a bit of elbow grease if he was to make any of it work."
katzen_AF.22.a:0 "An ocean of elbow grease, really."

katzen_AF.23.t:0 "The New Imperium"
katzen_AF.23.d:0 "Tailbeba Mewda sat in a seemingly endless line of Abyssinians, all waiting to get into a so-called “Katzenification Office”, dozens of which had recently been erected across Abyssinia by Kaiser Kattail.\n\nHaving been little more than a laborer all his life, he wasn't too sure what to expect and frankly hoped that this would be little more than a formality. After his livelihood was devastated by the Storm King's plundering, he had just barely managed to rebuild his life to an extent that he deemed acceptable and thus really didn't want to lose everything to the whims of some megalomaniac leader again.\n\n“Name, age, occupation, skills, ambitions?” The Katzen at the office's counter asked gruffly, snapping Tailbeba out of his thoughts.\n\n“Tailbeba Mewda, 37, laborer, hm, laboring, I guess? I did a bit of military training in my youth but nothing else... and...” Ambitions? That's an odd question, he thought. “...uuh... to travel the world, I suppose? I... never got the opportunity, being a peasant and all.”\n\n“Excellent. Then you're being assigned to the 1st Katzenkorps which is to be the Kaiser's finest. Forget about your peasantries though, the Kaiser will need the full potential of fresh Katzens like you if his visions are to be realized. As per the Katzenification Decree, you shall henceforth be known as Gustav Mewbert, proud Katzen of Katzennia,” the Katzen said, handing “Gustav” some papers and a freshly stamped ID.\n\n“Well, welcome to your new life! You may now proceed.” announced the clerk as the advancing line already pushed the confused Gustav out of the office."
katzen_AF.23.a:0 "They'll get used to it."

katzen_AF.24.t:0 "To Drain a Sea"
katzen_AF.24.d:0 "“A... dam?”, the lead engineer uttered in confusion to Kattail.\n\n“Yes, indeed. A dam! A big, beautiful dam, stretching from Cemareta to Jabal Tailiq which we have recently seized. Built out of the finest Katzen concrete and steel.” Kattail said triumphantly.\n\n“But... but why?”\n\n“I'm glad you asked. Well, it will hold back the ocean itself and allow for the reclamation of hundreds of square kilometers of land from the Arabian sea. A network of canals will keep former cities connected to the sea while we'll later be able to redirect the evaporated water to irrigate the Zebhara and turn it into something actually useful for our purposes.”\n\nDumbfounded, the head engineer thought for a bit. He and everyone else knew that this Kattail was a megalomaniac, but to dry a sea was a whole new level of insanity, really. “We'll... we'll need some time to think about the schematics, Herr Kai-”\n\n“Ah, the schematics, do not fret! I've got a few leads.” Kattail said as he pulled out a thick pile of paper from a suitcase before setting it down in front of the engineers. “I've done some of the preliminary thinking by myself, you should find that most of the math checks out, we just need sufficient industrial capability and it should all work out.”\n\nOf course, he could have provided the full schematics, but that would have been a bit too... suspicious. And besides, letting them fill in the blanks was a good test of their competence, Kattail thought as he watched his engineers trying to make sense of the plans..."
katzen_AF.24.a:0 "... the symbol of the new order."

katzen_AF.26.t:0 "Kattail Ad Aeternum"
katzen_AF.26.d:0 "Kattail, alongside his escort, strutted through the vast vaults of The Cave. Most of the artifacts stored there, while interesting in their own right, were mostly curiosities of little actual value for his plans.\n\nThey would thus be allowed to remain there with oversight from Katzen scientists who would be working with the Obsidian Council, whom promises of funding and cooperation had managed to sway to his side, in order to ensure the continued security and study of these magical trinkets.\n\nSome of the artifacts were far more dangerous, but also much more interesting. These would be studied extensively in order to bolster the Imperium's still lackluster science base, in a final bid to finally drag the Abyssinians out of the mud of technological backwardness which had impeded the Kaiser's conquest for too long.\n\nBut the Kaiser soon came face to face with what was perhaps The Cave's most important item. A large resplendent artifact from ages past, gleaming with ethereal purple energy, whose visible age only made it all the more enthralling.\n\nIt seemed as if it was of near-infinite complexity, orders of magnitude beyond what the people of this planet could have ever produced in their entire history. To everyone, its origins remained shrouded in mystery, with many believing it to be divine in origin, a construct perhaps forged by Boreas himself.\n\nBut to Kattail, the answer was obvious: the item's creator was none other than Aeternum, the galactic core's ancient precursor civilization. It seemed that, just as they had tempered with Flusion, so had they also tempered with this world and its people. Thus, so many more of these artifacts were almost certainly scattered throughout the planet.\n\nAnd Kattail intended to find each and every single one of them."
katzen_AF.26.a:0 "The treasures of the past shall fuel the wonders of the future."
