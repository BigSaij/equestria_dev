DEL_AF_coco_desc: "From Twizanbwe to Vermillion (heading west not east damn you), no living, sane creature had ever heard of the name Coco Schoppenboer-Potgieter, until now.\n\nThe adopted sister of Maya and Mymy, the friendly airhead and Springboks fan found herself in an extraordinarily weird place after pressing the button on a control panel in Mymy's room. The griffons, who found her passed out in a corner Griffeveld, spoke in something resembling Afrikaans. After a bit of banter, Coco ended up being received with a personal audience from the leader of the Zuid-Zebrikaansche Vrystaat, Atlas Steyn. She was then shoved behind a desk in the presidential office and proclaimed Staatspresident of the Vrystaat in front of an enthusiastic audience, much to her confusion. \n\nNow stuck in this land known as Zebrica, Coco's first order of the day is to look for Mymy, who had arrived a little earlier than her and had apparently colonized a piece of land under the name of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. She is going to have a talk with Mymy about this whole mess afterwards."

DEL_AF_mymy: "Mymy Schoppenboer"
DEL_AF_mymy_desc: "What best describes Mymy Schoppenboer? “A sister of mine!” Says her adopted Afrikaaner sister Coco, “A deranged ultranationalist,” says Maya, another sister of hers, “a troublemaker weak to bottles,” says Vera Persijn, her history teacher. The truth is, all of these descriptions are completely correct in their own right. \n\nAn appreciator of all things Dutch related and denier of Belgium, Mymy decided to look for somewhere to colonize under the name of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, only to find out the world doesn't really like direct colonialism anymore. Dejected from this setback, she then had a bright idea while munching on her stroopwafel for breakfast, “why not go for another world to colonize and spread the glorious Dutch Empire?”\n\nJumping straight into action, she put together a device that took her into a brave new world and landed in the Feathisian South Zebrides under the colonization of Feathisian griffons. Using her musket with reusable bullets, she has taken over the South Zebrides, re-established the VOC, and proclaimed the Dutch South Zebrides while renaming Beakavia to Japsterdam. If she can get Coco that landed somewhere on Zebrica to join her, the banner of Oranje-Nassau shall fly across the whole planet in their combined might."
