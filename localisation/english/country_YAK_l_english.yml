"Well, yaks mostly need industry help to win civil war, but it good for communist reasons too. As yak industry expands, will need more yak workers. These workers, called industrial proletariat, will lead future socialist revolution! And with Stalliongrad ponies help, yaks can raise class consciousness of workers very fast."\n\nWinter smirked.

It was the greatest tragedy of our kind since ancient days, and brought with it a long and costly war that devastated all yak lands. The jaks were not overcome, but they could also not defeat three united clans. The two sides stalemated until famine and economic collapse forced a grudging peace.\n\nOur naive belief in yak unity and fraternity is shattered, as is the myth of our strength in battle. Our ruined fields and desolate valleys are full of bitter, unhappy survivors of a war that should never have happened. The rich landowners of Yakistown might not mind a bit, but the disgruntled veteran clan warriors of Bara'dur and the impoverished workers of Karsakag demand changes.\n\nIn these bleak times, yaks return to the old ways, calling upon tribal elders to decide what must be done."

Elders from Bara'dur grumble ominously about the degeneracy of the younger, Harmonic-minded generation. Elders from Karsakag bring with them ideas of yaks who have spoken with the ponies of Stalliongrad. Every Elder talks about what must change.\n\nBut they are all united on one front. There can only be one Yakyakistan, whatever the future holds. Revolution, Democracy, Empire, Isolation, whatever comes, can only come after the Jaki are dealt with. The false prince and the traitors must be taught a lesson, and their yaks must rejoin the fold. They will not listen to words. Yakyakistan must go to war again."

Some Say that he has redeemed himself, and champion his new ideas. Others say that the war's losses were excessive, and that his weakness can no longer be tolerated. Finally, Elders from Karsakag now speak openly about ideas they once left to whispers. The exhuasted and overworked common yaks cry out for relief, and this new Communism business seems like just the way to help them.\n\nAfter days of debate and several stampedes and brawls, the elders must decide. Rutherford and his Harmonic Monarchy? Karsakag's elders and yak revolution? Or will Bara'dur put an end to all of this weakness and claim Yakyakistan's place in the sun?"

His gambit to loosen some of the grip of the newly founded Veteran's League on the elders is successful to an extent.

He hired yovidaphone players to play a great fanfare before announcing to a cheering crowd of thousands that the royal house was preparing a great feast for the hardworking yaks who had helped deliver Yakyakistan in its hour of direst need.

Efforts to bring yaks there into the fold of the nation have been met with resistance, with local officials that we allowed to stay in place stalling most of our projects, and with much of the local labor force refusing to work on projects that would benefit them and the nation as a whole. Shipping in labor from Karsakag has proved troublesome, as the trade unions demand better security and hazard pay on one side and the Jakistani malcontents harassing workers and refusing to sell to them on the other. While there has been talk of an official visit to the region to make gestures at reconciliation, it is at present too dangerous. \n\nThe war may be over, but it is likely that the Jakistani lands will bear scars of it for a very long time.

This has been somewhat successful, as our reconstruction efforts in areas they have visited are no longer harrassed or frustrated by local resistance. Some of the more nomadic jaks have filled the void that the sedentary merchants have vacated, selling to our workers at reasonable if inflated prices. Though many in Jakistan still see us as the enemy, they have also realized that our efforts can only help them, and we no longer have to scrounge for workers from Karsakag for public works."

 yakistan.10.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan, Final"
 yakistan.10.d:0 "In a moving address, the Elders of Yakistown, Bara'dur, and Karsakag spoke to large crowds in the former Jaki capitol. They spoke of shared hardships, and of the shared joys of recovery. They spoke at length about their desire to be one people again, and after they had all spoken, our leader delivered the final speech of the day. He spoke about our shared wounds, and about the horrors of war. In a shocking move, he proclaimed that the rebuilding of the capitol was being funded from his own personal estate, and from the personal estates of several other prominent yaks who had been involved in the leadup to war. It was arrogance that caused this rift, so he said to the crowd as he laid out his future plans for their city, and we will never be so foolish again.\n\nA great feast in the capitol followed, as Yak and Jak celebrated their newly-reborn fraternity once more, and all spoke excitedly of what the future might hold for Yakyakistan. The Jakistani resistance, though still technically existing, is functionally already irrelevant."

For the first time, many yaks see just how much wealth their ruler and Yakyakistan itself is capable of, but also that their leaders are talking and working together. The sight of invited veterans, common soldiers all, surprises yaks used to distant, elitist leadership. It is not quite as inspiring as one would hope, but the common yak cannot help but feel festive about Sneldarfest. The holiday is what we all need now, in times that are still hard."

Yet he finds instead that these strange little ponies delight him.\n\nThey are here on a mission of great import, here to hear out his minister's offer of alliance. Yakyakistan seeks to join the Equestria-led alliance. The changelings are rising, the griffons are resurgent, and the world is far more dangerous now than it was before--and so he needs friends. He needs allies, and Equestria needs a war-proven army to keep the Changelings and perhaps one day the griffons at bay. Can Rutherford and Celestia find common ground across vast cultural divides?

First, agriculture must be modernized to avoid famine now and forever; secondly, our industry is backwards and exploitative and it must be modernized; lastly, our culture is stagnant from worthless and reactionary traditionalism that must be purged through re-education. To this end, the Soviet announces the Great Leap Forward.\n\n'Comrades! Remember that we must all work hard for a glorious paradise, but rest assured that it is coming.

Safety was important, but digging Yakyakistan out of the backwards primitive hole it is currently in is paramount. If we cannot modernize quickly, we will be left in the dust. Our survival depends on building socialism in Yakyakistan, and building socialism in such a backwards country is going to be a messy affair."

The Grand Soviet passes further legislation requiring strict production quotas from the workers of Bara'dur. The protests are muted this time around. Every one of the ministers remembers that it was elders and veterans from Bara'dur that tried to drag us all into a supremacist nightmare. \n\nBut the motive of this decision is not revenge. Bara'dur has the military factories, and we need guns to safeguard the revolution. If anything, the Soviet sees this as a chance at redemption. We shall let the workers of Bara'dur prove their class loyalties through their contributions!"

The Grand Soviet has declared a day of celebration, where all of the undustrial workers and agricultural peasantry have been given the day off. Though our former allies amongst the Unionists complain that our methods have been needlessly dangerous, they are merely shortsighted. The workers endured and sacrificed for this victory, and we should all be proud of their work. Of course, it would be a bit pre-mature for us to lower the daily quotas, or to change our safety regulations just yet. We must make sure there is a surplus and a secure state first. But in the mean time, we have abolished the old rationing for most sections of the populace in recognition of our success."

The Grand Secretary is a proud yak, but he knows that we need allies. Represenatives of our party have arrived in Stalliongrad to negotiate our attendance of the next congress of the Internationale. This basic level of internationalist involvement is a vital step in the Soviet's ultimate plan to align itself with Stalliongrad politically and militarily.\n\nThe Stalliongradians are a bit hesitant about our methods and question our theory, but we are obviously fellow travelers. But our commitment to worldwide revolution and our zeal for spreading communist ideas to the peasantry impress them. When we ask for formal acceptance into the congress and eventual alliance..."

Jakistan is in ruins, and the loyal clans fare little better. The economy is in shambles, the army is exhausted, and we can barely make arms as it is.\n\nThe Khan will change all that. He has plans for all yaks to be strong and proud once again! We will fix the economy through rapid modernization, learning or staling technology as we can.

The build-up to war left us with a stronger industrial base than we had when the traitors first left. The yaks of Bara'dur and Karsakag now work for the state, building infastructure and more factories, guns and ammunition. \n\nFrom this beginning, Koletiv sees his next steps clearly. We must reclaim use of the Jaki lands and strengthen our economy through investment in military production. We will put yaks to work even as we build back our military in a new and far stronger mold."

But he is a saint compared to the despicable Jaki traitors. How dare they break apart our glorious nation!\n\nThe Khan moves forward with this plans to reclaim the use of Jaki land. Specifically, and against the wishes of many of the now-powerless elders, he has taken from the traitors much of their private holdings and turned it over to auction for those enterprises willing to use it for the glory of Yakyakistan to build new factories. The Jaki will not be forgiven. Those that deserve to live will do so when they have worked for redemption on our assembly lines and in our fields. They threw off being yaks, so let them be less than yaks until such a time as they can come to their senses."

 yakistan.22.t:0 "SMASHING Is The Highest Calling"
 yakistan.22.d:0 "With new weapons in hoof, the Khan plans for Yakyakistan's future conquests. Our neighbors are existential threats until we have either annihilated them or humbled them. The bears to the north are worthy opponents in hoof to claw, but their forces are weak compared to our own. Even further north, after we've crushed the bears, the penguins and their frozen empire might also be worth our time to subjugate.\n\nTo the east is the difficult yet rewarding task of teaching the griffons a long overdue lesson for driving us out of our ancestral lands. They will be difficult to defeat, but it will be a war that most yaks are hungry for...\n\nTo the south is Equestria and the Crystal Empire. These are, for now, far beyond us. One day, once we've united much of the continent under our rule, we can dream of storming through the southern lands.\n\nThe last choice is to go west. The Changelings are a mysterious, if disgusting people. We know little besides myth and legend, and that their tanks are legendary. They have industry and resources, that we know, and those things may win us the continent if we can claim them for our own. "

 yakistan.23.d:0 "It was a normal day. Khan Koletiv reviewed reports from his general staff on the state of the army, and was pleased. Things were going well. Only the night before, he discussed in detail the logistics of invading the changelings to the west. His generals were split on the matter, but all agreed that sound plans would be required.\n\nHe took breakfast as he always did without anyone present, and so was surprised when a young officer entered. But he was loathe to treat any military yak poorly! He hailed the officer. 'What is your business here? I take my meals alone, young yak.'\n\n'I'm sorry to bother you, sir,' said the stranger. 'It's just that I have an urgent dispatch. May I approach?'\n\nUrgent? His brow furrowed. If it was worth disturbing him... 'Yes. Come closer.'\n\nThe young officer approached, and reached into the pack at his side. The Khan began to rise...\n\nAnd then it was just a normal day. The Khan ate alone, as he always did, and no one disturbed him. He went about his normal routine, and no one was any bit the wiser. Except, of course, for a keen young officer helping some orderlies carry a large package away."

Its people were strangers, but whether because of infiltrator indoctrination or a natural communal spirit, we have grown closer. A changeling queen leads the country, and changeling hives in the countryside join joint hive cities where yaks and Changeling colonists live in relative peace.\n\nWe are slowly but surely becoming one people, strange and intermingled, but one. Perhaps one day we shall teach them to change their forms, and they shall give us their strength.\n\nBut the motherland calls us, interrupting our newfound lives. The Queen demands a renewal of our oaths. Changelings across the frontier look around and begin to ask questions that seemed impossible before--do we truly need to live under Chrysalis' yoke? Can we not live as changelings in a new land on our own?\n\nOr do we demonstrate our loyalties to our species and Queen? A New Frontier with a new way of life, or just a colony of the Great Empire?"

We have been granted some autonomy and self-rule in return for unswerving loyalty to her aims, and this is good enough for us.\n\nYakiland, or the Frontier as it is sometimes called, is metamorphosing into a strange hybrid society. Indoctrination has given way to something approaching a hybrid society, and the old machinery of domination has been replaced by yaks who are integrated mind and soul into our hives, often without even knowing it, as we now integrate ourselves. The UnderQueen has been replaced, and the secrecy of the Khan's true identity has been maintained. The future is bright!"

 POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride."
 POLITICS_KARSAK_SUKHBATAAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of October, 970 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yngvar has had a long and successful career in the Ghenikhan clan army, from infantry grunt to commander. Heavily influenced by Thyra's radical rhetoric, he hates the rich who exploit the worker, the priests who brainwash them, and the royalty who rule them. He supported her popular protest against Rutherford, but when she condemned the violence it produced, he knew she was too soft for the business of revolution.\n\nNow he steers the ship of state alone, a red autocrat, and he intends to march Yakyakistan to glory and free the rest of the workers of the North - whether they like it or not. And in pursuit of this great and noble goal, no method will be too extreme. The Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army will see the North liberated, no matter what it takes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Илларион"
 POLITICS_OVLIINKHUVISGAL_ELBEGDORJ_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 959 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Thyra is a polarizing name in Yakyakistan. As often called a traitor as a hero, she studied at Stalliongrad for years, and saw both how brilliant Steel Stallion's leadership was and how it disintegrated after his death. Would this be the fate of every communist revolution? Distraught, she returned to the peasants, and saw their councils taking charge. She formulated a new thesis then: the vanguard party could not be the basis of communism. Only the workers themselves could liberate themselves, and the councils would be the core of this.\n\nWhen Rutherford reunited Yakyakistan, she knew the time was ripe to free the yaks. She organized a peaceful protest in the capital, and persuaded him to abdicate and let her form a new government in return for some promises to treat the harmonists of Yakyakistan well. Now the time has come to form a Northern Republic of Councils, so that all the peoples of North Equus might be truly free.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: TBA"
 POLITICS_KHAN_KOLETIV_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 962 in Bara'dur.\n\n§YBiography§!: Koletiv is the leader of the Yürkids, the most militaristic and expansionist of the clans, and a onetime friend of Prince Bradford's. Unfortunately, politics must always come before friendship, and Bradford would have led Yakyakistan to ruin through his tepid isolationism. How could he not see the growing threats on the continent? The changelings would never be content to have the yaks as a neutral nation, and nor would the ponies let the enclave live in peace with Rutherford and Yona slandering them. No, only by massively expanding the army and striking first can the yaks be safe. By proclaiming himself Khan, Koletiv has thrown a gauntlet at the rulers of North Equus--no more will the yaks just accept the attacks against them. No longer will the yaks cower. No, from now on, it will be those others who cower at the yaks' hooves!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Илларион"

If they succeed, they will institute a brutal dictatorship atop us, killing hundreds of thousands and enslaving the rest. Therefore, we must ensure they fail.

No matter how you might feel about the Jakichikhs, none can deny their importance in the formation of the Yak nation. Had it not been for them standing their ground during the Griffons' march west there may not have been a Yak Kingdom, as this was the spark for the need of nation of united clans. They stood up to the invaders, even if they were not the first in line to fall, and called the smaller clans around them to war against the foreign colonists, destroying them with the help of the mighty Yürkids."

Quickly becoming known for their competency in fortifying positions and wearing out the enemy in long defensive engagements, they were soon being called the "shield" of the Yaks, with the Yürkids taking the title of "sword". Like the other four minor clans who swore their loyalty to the Jakichikh Chief, Menggudei, the Ubkhaits joined them in a Clan Confederation even joining them in their secession from the Kingdom of Yakyakistan.

Though the empire had been long gone by the time of the war against the Griffon menace, they heeded the call and stood proudly besides the Jakichikh, raising ancient banners from a time long gone. Some of them dream of the empire of old being restored, greater than before, believing the Jakichikh secession to be the start of something greater."

Humiliated and without food for the winter, they bitterly agreed to the Jaki Clan Confederation, being the last of the eastern clans to accept. They're still remembered for their failure to defend their homelands and distrusted by all but the Jakichikhs."
