 yakistan.1.t:0 "Two Yakyakistans"
 yakistan.1.d:0 "Years ago, the Jaki-clan tore our unified nation apart when they secceeded from Yakyakistan. It was the greatest tragedy of our kind since ancient days, and brought with it a long and costly war that devastated all yak lands. The jaks were not overcome, but they could also not defeat three united clans. The two sides stalemated until famine and economic collapse forced a grudging peace.\n\nOur naive belief in yak unity and fraternity is shattered, as is the myth of our strength in battle. Our ruined fields and desolate valleys are full of bitter, unhappy survivors of a war that should never have happened. The rich landowners of Yakistown might not mind a bit, but the disgruntled veteran clan warriors of Bara'dur and the impoverished workers of Karsakag demand changes.\n\nIn these bleak times, yaks return to the old ways, calling upon tribal elders to decide what must be done."
 yakistan.1.a:0 "May our ancestors protect us..."

 yakistan.2.t:0 "Prelude to War"
 yakistan.2.d:0 "The Elders talk long into the night, and the conversation is difficult to follow. They talk of the Seccessionist clan and its complaints. Some Elders, bitter from the pointless loss of life, go as far as to blame Rutherford and his policies for the rift, calling him an upstart and a schismatic. Elders from Bara'dur grumble ominously about the degeneracy of the younger, Harmonic-minded generation. Elders from Karsakag bring with them ideas of yaks who have spoken with the ponies of Stalliongrad. Every Elder talks about what must change.\n\nBut they are all united on one front. There can only be one Yakyakistan, whatever the future holds. Revolution, Democracy, Empire, Isolation, whatever comes, can only come after the Jaki are dealt with. The false prince and the traitors must be taught a lesson, and their yaks must rejoin the fold. They will not listen to words. Yakyakistan must go to war again."
 yakistan.2.a:0 "The Elders have spoken!"
 
 yakistan.3.t:0 "The Election"
 yakistan.3.d:0 "The Elders put off the decision regarding Yakyakistan's future until the war was won, and now that the Jaki have been humbled, they meet again. Prince Rutherford led the armies of Yakyakistan well, but no one has forgotten that it was Rutherford who lost the Jaki in the first place. Some Say that he has redeemed himself, and champion his new ideas. Others say that the war's losses were excessive, and that his weakness can no longer be tolerated. Finally, Elders from Karsakag now speak openly about ideas they once left to whispers. The exhuasted and overworked common yaks cry out for relief, and this new Communism business seems like just the way to help them.\n\nAfter days of debate and several stampedes and brawls, the elders must decide. Rutherford and his Harmonic Monarchy? Karsakag's elders and yak revolution? Or will Bara'dur put an end to all of this weakness and claim Yakyakistan's place in the sun?"
 yakistan.3.a:0 "We Believe in Rutherford and Harmony!"
 yakistan.3.b:0 "Bara'dur is right. Yakyakistan First and Only!"
 yakistan.3.c:0 "The common yak shall no longer suffer. For the People!"
 
 yakistan.4.t:0 "The Fate of Bradford"
 yakistan.4.d:0 "'Prince' Bradford led the Jaki rebels, and now he is in our custody. So far, we have left him alone to think over his failures, but he is a loose end. Most of the Elders want to have him killed or imprisoned for life. Those who supported the harmonic ideas that Rutherford introduced propose that he be forgiven and one day allowed to lead his people once more, this time in defence of all yaks. The response to this was absolutely deafening, but eventually order was restored. What shall we do with this misguided patriot-turned-traitor?"
 yakistan.4.a:0 "Heal the wounds and spare him."
 yakistan.4.b:0 "Show the Jaki the price of betrayal."
 
 yakistan.5.t:0 "The Scars of War"
 yakistan.5.d:0 "The war is over, but our problems continue. The laborers are exhausted, the army is spent, and the coffers are empty. The Jaki have returned, but their place in Yakyakistan is no longer an easy or natural one. As soldiers return home and yaks rebuild their shattered lives, the government must work out how best to reintegrate the rebel lands. The Jaki's hostility is strong, and until we have won them over and they accept our rule, their reluctance will make rebuilding more dificult."
 yakistan.5.a:0 "One way or another, we are One."
 
 yakistan.6.t:0 "Palaver of the Warriors"
 yakistan.6.d:0 "After the first war, the veterans of Bara'dur were bitter and let their hatreds fester. Their elders pushed for empire and merciless razing of Jaki settlements. The Prince arrives in Bara'dur and holds court, inviting the elders of the clan to air their grievances and concerns, while also offering their counsel. His gambit to loosen some of the grip of the newly founded Veteran's League on the elders is successful to an extent. The Prince holds a great feast, inviting the greatest of Bara'dur's warriors and heroes as well as its elites and eventually even the common yaks. The Feast of Bara'dur is spoken of for years afterwards as the time when the clan felt whole again."
 yakistan.6.a:0 "A toast!"
 
 yakistan.7.t:0 "Fanfare For the Common Yak"
 yakistan.7.d:0 "Some of his retinue expressed concern about going in person to Karsakag, being that it is a hotbed of communist sentiment. But the Prince was undeterred. Communists or not, they are all yaks, and they are all his people. He hired yovidaphone players to play a great fanfare before announcing to a cheering crowd of thousands that the royal house was preparing a great feast for the hardworking yaks who had helped deliver Yakyakistan in its hour of direst need. They are the true heroes, he said, and all of the accolades and honor belong to them. Even the trade unionists were impressed by his sincerity."
 yakistan.7.a:0 "Bread and Maybe a Few Roses!"
 
 yakistan.8.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan"
 yakistan.8.d:0 "While the loyal clans have seen great reconstruction efforts, the desolation of Jakistan is still largely the same. Efforts to bring yaks there into the fold of the nation have been met with resistance, with local officials that we allowed to stay in place stalling most of our projects, and with much of the local labor force refusing to work on projects that would benefit them and the nation as a whole. Shipping in labor from Karsakag has proved troublesome, as the trade unions demand better security and hazard pay on one side and the Jakistani malcontents harassing workers and refusing to sell to them on the other. While there has been talk of an official visit to the region to make gestures at reconciliation, it is at present too dangerous. \n\nThe war may be over, but it is likely that the Jakistani lands will bear scars of it for a very long time. But no matter what, we will press on until all yaks are united again."
 yakistan.8.a:0 "We'll Keep Trying"
 
 yakistan.9.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan, Redux"
 yakistan.9.d:0 "Elders from Yakistown and Karsakag have visited some of the more traditionalist-minded villages and towns of Jakistan on a mission of peace. This has been somewhat successful, as our reconstruction efforts in areas they have visited are no longer harrassed or frustrated by local resistance. Some of the more nomadic jaks have filled the void that the sedentary merchants have vacated, selling to our workers at reasonable if inflated prices. Though many in Jakistan still see us as the enemy, they have also realized that our efforts can only help them, and we no longer have to scrounge for workers from Karsakag for public works."
 yakistan.9.a:0 "The Jaki shall be our partners."
 
 yakistan.10.t:0 "Trouble in Jakistan, Final"
 yakistan.10.d:0 "In a moving address, the Elders of Yakistown, Bara'dur, and Karsakag spoke to large crowds in the former Jaki capitol. They spoke of shared hardships, and of the shared joys of recovery. They spoke at length about their desire to be one people again, and after they had all spoken, our leader delivered the final speech of the day. He spoke about our shared wounds, and about the horrors of war. In a shocking move, he proclaimed that the rebuilding of the capitol was being funded from his own personal estate, and from the personal estates of several other prominent yaks who had been involved in the leadup to war. It was arrogance that caused this rift, so he said to the crowd as he laid out his future plans for their city, and we will never be so foolish again.\n\nA great feast in the capitol followed, as Yak and Jak celebrated their newly-reborn fraternity once more, and all spoke excitedly of what the future might hold for Yakyakistan. The Jakistani resistance, though still technically existing, is functionally already irrelevant."
 yakistan.10.a:0 "Finally, we have healed."
 
 yakistan.11.t:0 "The Prince's Sneldarfest in Bara'dur"
 yakistan.11.d:0 "Every year, yaks all across Yakyakistan celebrate the most important yak festival--Sneldarfest! The royal household is no different. As part of his attempts to unify the tribes once more, Prince Rutherford has turned the royal festivities into a feast for the elders and leading yaks of all the clans, even inviting the head-yaks of some of the larger nomadic herds to Yakistown.\n\nYaks across the nation are treated to a full page of glorious photos of the event. For the first time, many yaks see just how much wealth their ruler and Yakyakistan itself is capable of, but also that their leaders are talking and working together. The sight of invited veterans, common soldiers all, surprises yaks used to distant, elitist leadership. It is not quite as inspiring as one would hope, but the common yak cannot help but feel festive about Sneldarfest. The holiday is what we all need now, in times that are still hard."
 yakistan.11.a:0 "Happy Sneldarfest!"
 
 yakistan.12.t:0 "The Equestrian Alliance"
 yakistan.12.d:0 "Late at night, in the palatial suites in Yakistown, the Prince of Yakyakistan and his advisors host a party of ponies. They are very strange creatures, these ponies. They are so small and frail, yet have so much power and influence. On some level, it should offend the yak way. Yet he finds instead that these strange little ponies delight him.\n\nThey are here on a mission of great import, here to hear out his minister's offer of alliance. Yakyakistan seeks to join the Equestria-led alliance. The changelings are rising, the griffons are resurgent, and the world is far more dangerous now than it was before--and so he needs friends. He needs allies, and Equestria needs a war-proven army to keep the Changelings and perhaps one day the griffons at bay. Can Rutherford and Celestia find common ground across vast cultural divides? And if she can... should we tie ourselves to the Sun and its troubles?"
 yakistan.12.a:0 "Yakyakistan joins the Alliance!"
 yakistan.12.b:0 "Negotiations break down..."
 
 yakistan.13.t:0 "The Yakyakistani Revolution"
 yakistan.13.d:0 "It was a close thing, but when the supremacist Veteran's League from Bara'dur showed its true colors, the Harmonists and Traditionalists joined us in expelling their Elders. We made short work of the elections from there on out.\n\nComrade Secretary Karsak Sükhbataar emerges as leader of the new Grand Soviet which has supplanted the prince and his stooges. But our people are backwards. As communists, we understand that the peasantry must be educated and given what they have long been denied. Socialization of agriculture is important, but first we must introduce the teachings of Stalliongrad... with Yak characteristics, of course. "
 yakistan.13.a:0 "All Power to the Soviet!"

 yakistan.14.t:0 "Preparing a Great Leap Forward"
 yakistan.14.d:0 ""We have inherited a shattered nation. The greedy capitalist war, the pointless political squabbling, the exploitation of the people... There is much work to be done. From Karsakag, the Yakistani Soviet prepares a great plan. It has three main goals. First, agriculture must be modernized to avoid famine now and forever; secondly, our industry is backwards and exploitative and it must be modernized; lastly, our culture is stagnant from worthless and reactionary traditionalism that must be purged through re-education. To this end, the Soviet announces the Great Leap Forward.\n\n'Comrades! Remember that we must all work hard for a glorious paradise, but rest assured that it is coming. Yakyakistan shall be for the workers at last!" announced Comrade Secretary Sükhbataar in the party's newspaper."
 yakistan.14.a:0 "From Every Yak's ability!"
 
 yakistan.15.t:0 "The Civilian Industrial Plan"
 yakistan.15.d:0 "As part of our efforts to modernize, the Grand Soviet of the Party has voted to roll out a series of updates to our factories. Though some worried over the lack of safety measures, Secretary Sükhbataar cast the deciding vote to push the measure through. Safety was important, but digging Yakyakistan out of the backwards primitive hole it is currently in is paramount. If we cannot modernize quickly, we will be left in the dust. Our survival depends on building socialism in Yakyakistan, and building socialism in such a backwards country is going to be a messy affair."
 yakistan.15.a:0 "To Every Yak's need!"

 POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of February, 967 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_KARSAK_SUKHBATAAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of October, 970 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yngvar has had a long and successful career in the Ghenikhan clan army, from infantry grunt to commander. Heavily influenced by Thyra's radical rhetoric, he hates the rich who exploit the worker, the priests who brainwash them, and the royalty who rule them. He supported her popular protest against Rutherford, but when she condemned the violence it produced, he knew she was too soft for the business of revolution.\n\nNow he steers the ship of state alone, a red autocrat, and he intends to march Yakyakistan to glory and free the rest of the workers of the North - whether they like it or not. And in pursuit of this great and noble goal, no method will be too extreme. The Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army will see the North liberated, no matter what it takes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
 POLITICS_OVLIINKHUVISGAL_ELBEGDORJ_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 959 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Thyra is a polarizing name in Yakyakistan. As often called a traitor as a hero, she studied at Stalliongrad for years, and saw both how brilliant Steel Stallion's leadership was and how it disintegrated after his death. Would this be the fate of every communist revolution? Distraught, she returned to the peasants, and saw their councils taking charge. She formulated a new thesis then: the vanguard party could not be the basis of communism. Only the workers themselves could liberate themselves, and the councils would be the core of this.\n\nWhen Rutherford reunited Yakyakistan, she knew the time was ripe to free the yaks. She organized a peaceful protest in the capital, and persuaded him to abdicate and let her form a new government in return for some promises to treat the harmonists of Yakyakistan well. Now the time has come to form a Northern Republic of Councils, so that all the peoples of North Equus might be truly free.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_YONA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of December, 990 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yona is a young, eager, and bright yak, who loves her home and her people. From a humble family, she volunteered to visit Princess Twilight's School of Friendship, where she became good friends with five other students, especially a pony named Sandbar.\n\nShe's a bit overwhelmed by the responsibility, but she's sworn to do her friends proud. Rutherford may no longer be Prince, but he's still a valued friend and she often finds herself consulting with him. If only the world could know peace, rather than the constant fighting that the extremists seem to be imposing on them.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_KHAN_KOLETIV_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 962 in Bara'dur.\n\n§YBiography§!: Kerr is the leader of the Yürkids, the most militaristic and expansionist of the clans, and a onetime friend of Prince Bradford's. Unfortunately, politics must always come before friendship, and Bradford would have led Yakyakistan to ruin through his tepid isolationism. How could he not see the growing threats on the continent? The changelings would never be content to have the yaks as a neutral nation, and nor would the ponies let the enclave live in peace with Rutherford and Yona slandering them. No, only by massively expanding the army and striking first can the yaks be safe. By proclaiming himself Khan, Kerr has thrown a gauntlet at the rulers of North Equus--no more will the yaks just accept the attacks against them. No longer will the yaks cower. No, from now on, it will be those others who cower at the yaks' hooves!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

They're by far the most militaristic of all the clans, let alone the Great Clans, destroying any trace of the clans around them early in Yak history, replacing them with their own traditions.

No matter how you might feel about the Jakichikhs, none can deny their importance in the formation of the Yak nation. Had it not been for them standing their ground during the Griffons' march west there may not have been a Yak Kingdom, as this was the spark for the need of nation of united clans. They stood up to the invaders, even if they were not the first in line to fall, and called the smaller clans around them to war against the foreign colonists, destroying them with the help of the mighty Yürkids."

Quickly becoming known for their competency in fortifying positions and wearing out the enemy in long defensive engagements, they were soon being called the "shield" of the Yaks, with the Yürkids taking the title of "sword". Like the other four minor clans who swore their loyalty to the Jakichikh Chief, Menggudei, the Ubkhaits joined them in a Clan Confederation even joining them in their secession from the Kingdom of Yakyakistan. Like many of the eastern clans they also lost land to the Griffons."

Though the empire had been long gone by the time of the war against the Griffon menace, they heeded the call and stood proudly besides the Jakichikh, raising ancient banners from a time long gone. Some of them dream of the empire of old being restored, greater than before, believing the Jakichikh secession to be the start of something greater."

Humiliated and without food for the winter, they bitterly agreed to the Jaki Clan Confederation, being the last of the eastern clans to accept. They're still remembered for their failure to defend their homelands and distrusted by all but the Jakichikhs."
