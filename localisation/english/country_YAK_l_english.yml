 newyaks.3.d:0 "The Khuraltai, or clan assembly, is where the elders of all yak clans gather to decide issues of national importance. In most other nations such a meeting would be filled with calm and respectful deliberations between seasoned political leaders.\n\nBut this was Yakyakistan, and this assembly was anything but calm and respectful.\n\n"Kiyatukh Clan harvesting vanilla beans in Mankhutayid Clan land!" Shouted Menggei, elder of the Mankhutayids. "This disgraceful! Kiyatukh Clan must be punished!"\nWithout waiting for Menggei to yield the floor, the Kiyatukh elder fired back. "Mankhutayid yak lies! Southern valley always belong to Kiyatukh Clan, other yaks just jealous!"\n\nMany other clan elders weren't even paying attention, too busy stomping or butting horns with each other. Thyra, the Ghenikhan Clan's representative, looked on in disgust. The seats for the Yürkid Clan elders were conspicuously empty.\n\n"Yaks be quiet!" Prince Rutherford said with a snort, "Yak called this Khuraltai to plan war against Jaki Clan traitors, not to hear clan elders bicker like calves!"\n\n"Why should yaks help Prince Rutherford?" the Kiyatukh elder sneered, "Prince yak has no respect for clan autonomy!"\n"Yak right! Prince Rutherford act more like pony than yak!"\n"At least Jaki Clan respect yak traditions!"\n\nPrince Rutherford growled. Trying to force the elders into line alone was clearly a lost cause. To survive the coming war he needed an ally, a clan willing to help that didn't have to be bribed into supporting his reforms."
 newyaks.3.a:0 "And only one clan came to mind..."

 newyaks.4.t:0 "The Prince"
 newyaks.4.d:0 ""YAKS DESTROY!" Yelled Prince Rutherford, splitting a log with his hooves.\n\nWhenever the Prince needed a break from the stress of ruling, he always made his way to the Yakistown smashing grounds. Turning wood into splinters cleared his head like nothing else. After smashing through another log with his forehead, Rutherford stopped to catch his breath. He looked around at his retainers, each one stomping through their own pile.\n\n"Yojan!" he exclaimed, "That perfect angle for optimal smashing! Excellent work."\n\nYojan smiled in surprise. "Yak honored, but still need to improve. Yak not smash as good as Prince yak."\n\n"Of course not! As Prince of All Yaks, yak best at smashing! Even when Prince was little yak, Prince always smash better than brother Bradford."\n\nSuddenly Rutherford paused, an unhappy thought intruding into his mind. "Yak and brother Bradford were close friends. When yak became Prince, yak spend less time with Bradford. Prince knew Bradford unhappy with reforms, but never imagined Bradford would go so far..." \n\nYojan looked concerned. "Maybe it not too late? Prince yak can still talk with brother-"\n\n "NO!" Rutherford yelled, his eyes filling with rage. "Brother Bradford is TRAITOR! Bradford conspire with Jaki Clan, destroy unity of Yakyakistan, shed blood of loyal yaks! As Prince, yak must destroy Bradford and Jaki Clan, no matter the cost!""

Smiling and waving politely, she continued walking towards the Yakistown market. Her siblings, walking beside her, were much more enthusiastic.\n\n"Yona is hero yak!" said her little sister, "Yona went to pony school, learned from pony princess!"\n"And Yona defeat evil pony!" added her little brother.\n\n"That not true," she replied, "Yona not save day alone, had help from friends. Yona only did what any yak would do."\n\nAfter the trio finished shopping they made their way home. They were greeted by a crowd of younger yaks waiting outside their house.\n\nOne of the youths stepped forward and said, "Yaks form volunteer battalion, train to fight war against Jaki-Clan. Yaks fight for friendship and harmony in Yakyakstan. Yaks want Yona to lead us!"\n\n"Yona accept." She replied without hesitation.\n\nThe young volunteers and Yona's brother were excited, but her sister realized the danger. "War scary. Yona not have to fight." she pleaded.\n\n"Yes Yona do.

 newyaks.6.t:0 "The Firebrand"
 newyaks.6.d:0 "In all societies throughout history, the vast majority of creatures have been peasants. Yaks, ponies and griffons alike eked out a meager existence on farms, surrendering their surplus to the ruling class. The peasant life kept creatures isolated and ignorant, making broad-based organization impossible. This was why Caramel Marks called them "a sack of potatoes."\n\nThen the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Creatures transitioned to factory work, throwing feudal class relations into chaos. And now, at long last, that change had come to Yakyakistan.\n\nAs Thyra and her comrades marched through the valley, vibrant green fields gave way to dull gray walls and plumes of black smoke. She smiled to herself. The factory wasn't exactly pretty, but it was the harbinger of a brighter future. A future that belonged to the workers toiling inside.\n\nThe dismissal bell chimed. As the yaks finished up their manager, some stooge appointed by Rutherford, made an announcement.\n"Yaks not meet quota again. Tomorrow yaks must start 1 hour early!"\n\nBoos and jeers rang out across the factory floor. When the workers filed out Thyra and her organizers slipped into the crowd.\n"This ridiculous!" huffed one yak worker, "Boss yak ask for the impossible."\n"Boss yak sit around all day," said another, "Has no idea how factory works!"\n\n"Worker yaks right." Thyra said, grinning ever wider. "Wouldn't factory be better if yak workers ran it themselves?""

 newyaks.7.t:0 "The Officer"
 newyaks.7.d:0 "At a training camp in the mountains outside Yakistown, new recruits were practicing at the firing range. The drill instructor, a yak named Yngvar, walked among them and harshly critiqued each one. If he didn't find fault with their aim it was the way they held the rifles, or their posture while shooting.\n\nMost of Yngvar's trainees were clanless, hailing from poor families on the margins of yak society. Unlike most commanders he actually preferred yaks of humble origins. When his recruits lacked the arrogance of the great clans it was easier to break them down and mold them into proper soldiers.\n\nYngvar noticed that one recruit had stopped firing his breech loader, a sullen expression on his face.\n\n"What problem?" Yngvar asked.\n\n"Yak not see point. Gun slow and hard to aim, never defeat charge of yak warriors."\n\nYngvar didn't respond immediately. He reached for the modern bolt action rifle on his back, brought it forward and aimed at the target, a barrel of hay. He unloaded the entire magazine into the hay, scoring a direct hit with every shot. The trainees looked on in stunned silence.\n\n"Old ways of war not work anymore. To be strong yaks must learn modern tactics, like aiming. Now back to practice, or else yak will be next target!""
 newyaks.7.a:0 "We have to be strong to reunite the nation."

 newyaks.8.t:0 "Yakyakistan Requests Military Aid"
 newyaks.8.d:0 "Winter Frost cast an uneasy glance at the yak in front of her. The Committee on Revolution in North Equus very rarely received petitioners, and had never heard a request like this one.\n\n"So to summarize," she said, trying to keep her tone neutral, "you want us to provide military aid to Prince Rutherford, an absolute monarch with ties to Equestria? I'm sorry, but that would require completely ignoring our strategic interests, not to mention all of communist theory."\n\nThe yak smiled back unfazed. "Not true, comrade pony! By opening up Yakyakistan to Equestrian trade Prince Rutherford began yak bourgeois democratic revolution. Yaks need this so yaks can have second, proletarian socialist revolution."\n\nWinter's jaw dropped. She had not expected the yak to be well versed in theory.\n\n"If yaks win upcoming war with Stalliongrad ponies help, communist yaks can make attempt to overthrow Rutherford. If ponies not help and Jaki-Clan win, all yak economic progress will be erased and Yakyakistan will become reactionary stronghold in North Equus. Choice is yours, can yaks count on comrade ponies?""
 newyaks.8.a:0 "For now, we'll work with the Prince."
 newyaks.8.b:0 "No compromise with monarchists."

 newyaks.9.t:0 "Red Army Advisors Arrive"
 newyaks.9.d:0 ""Yaks thank communist ponies for helping," Prince Rutherford said to the newly arrived volunteers from Stalliongrad, "But remember: Yakyakistan not communist country. Prince Rutherford still in charge. Ponies better not break Prince's rules, or else!"\n\nThe mares and stallions of the Red Army rolled their eyes at this display. Here they were, risking their necks to help the yaks win their civil war, and this reactionary monarch had the gaul to threaten them? Talk about getting off on the wrong hoof.\n\nAs Rutherford walked away Thyra took his place. Her bright smile contrasted sharply with the Prince's scowl.\n\n"Comrade ponies no worry about Prince yak. Prince all talk and no action, just like pony Princess!"\n\nThat got a laugh from all the volunteers. With the ice now broken, Thyra began explaining their assignment. They were to assist Yakyakistan's fledgling army, training new recruits to use modern weapons and tactics. If the ponies also happened to tell the yak soldiers about Marksism and the Revolution in Stalliongrad, that was good too. No one would tell the Prince."
 newyaks.9.a:0 "In snowy mountains a red flower blooms."

 newyaks.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"
 newyaks.10.d:0 "Stalliongrad's reply to the yak request for aid was brief: "In light of the limited resources at our disposal, and the reactionary nature of Prince Rutherford's government, we are unwilling to send military advisors to Yakyakstan at this time."\n\n"Communist ponies not help?" Prince Rutherford said with a smile, "Hah! Yaks no need their help. Yak warriors will fight Jaki-Clan traitors alone!"\n\nWhen Thyra heard the news she was dismayed, but mostly annoyed. She had always believed the ponies of Stalliongrad were sincere in their desire to spread the revolution. Refusing to help their yak comrades was quite the slap in the face."
 newyaks.10.a:0 "What's even the point?"

 newyaks.11.t:0 "Yakyakistan Requests Civilian Aid"
 newyaks.11.d:0 "Winter Frost shuffled some paperwork aside and turned her attention to the yak in the room. With a civil war in Yakyakistan looming, their visits were becoming a common occurrence.\n\n"Ok, let's see here. Prince Rutherford, not content with asking us for military aid, is now requesting technical experts to build up Yakyakistan's nascent industries. And I suppose you're going to quote me some theory to explain why granting this isn't completely asinine?"\n\nThe yak gave a sheepish grin. "Well, yaks mostly need industry help to win civil war, but it good for communist reasons too. As yak industry expands, will need more yak workers. These workers, called industrial proletariat, will lead future socialist revolution! And with Stalliongrad ponies help, yaks can raise class consciousness of workers very fast."\n\nWinter smirked. "Not a bad argument, but this isn't exactly an open and shut case. I'll call the committee to a vote.""
 newyaks.11.a:0 "We can spare some bureaucrats and engineers."
 newyaks.11.b:0 "Our resources are better used elsewhere."

 newyaks.12.t:0 "The Spectre of Communism"
 newyaks.12.d:0 "Thyra watched with glee as another plane came in from Stalliongrad. As it landed she busied herself directing the new arrivals to their destinations: bureaucrats to the government hut, engineers to the factories, etc.\n\nWith every passing day more ponies from Stalliongrad arrived, and every day they introduced new technologies and forms of administration to Yakyakistan. Thrya had dreamed of dragging her country into modernity for a long time, kicking and screaming if necessary. She was glad her old comrades were willing to help speed up that process.\n\nOn the far end of the dirt runway, Prince Rutherford looked on in mounting horror. Every day the communist plague spread further, infecting yaks throughout his government and military. He knew that Thyra and Stalliongrad were planning to overthrow him when the war was over. Once he thought their challenge would be easy to crush, but now he wasn't so sure."

Rutherford said, grinning, "Yaks not need their help! Yaks modernize all on our own."\n\nOn the other side of the room Thyra made a face. Her comrades had really let her down this time. She wanted nothing more than to drag Yakyakistan into modernity, but her plans relied on help from a modern industrial state. Without that everything was going to be much harder."
 newyaks.13.a:0 "Why did we bother asking?"

 newyaks.14.t:0 "An Old Friend"
 newyaks.14.d:0 "Prince Rutherford removed the record from the gramophone after the last melody faded out. The device was a gift from one of Pinkie Pie's friends, Spike.The music was a brief retreat from the hectic affairs of the Khuraltai, though somepony else had arrived to brighten the Prince’s mood.\n\n"Wow! You can't believe how long it took me to get here! I didn't know trotting through the Crystal Mountains would take so long and all-"\n\n"Pink pony!" Rutherford suddenly hugged Pinkie Pie, causing the earth pony to cough from the force. "Yak not see pink pony for several moons!"\n\nRutherford soon let go of the hug. "Honored to meet you, Prince! Now, I've heard you got a teensy-weensy problem with your brother and all..."\n\n"Pink pony talk of traitor brother Bradford?” he snorted.\n\n"Yeah! I mean, I have a family of my own, with my sisters Maud, Limestone, and Marble Pie," Pinkie answered with a hop. "We sometimes get arguments between each other, but it's nothing a little talk can't sort out. What I'm sayin' and all is, we can avoid a lot of yaks getting hurt."\n\nRutherford grumbled under his breath. What Pinkie Pie said was similar to what some of his fellow yaks had said. "Not possible. Bradford not see reason. Never will."\n\nPinkie sank for a moment before brightening up again, suddenly pulling out a stack of vanilla cake. "On another note...I know being a Prince is hard and all, so I brought a little something extra from back home, straight from Sugarcube Corner!" Pinkie added.\n\nThe prince's mood quickly lightened up as he briefly looked at the cake and gulped it in one bite. "Pony cake good. Yak like!" he said after swallowing the cake whole."

 newyaks.16.d:0 "Yona grimaced at the papers she had just received. The protests in Yakistown had grown in size, with thousands of angry yaks calling for the overthrow of Prince Rutherford. It didn’t take long for the protests to get violent; the mob threw chunks of stone covered in ice at the guards, and one had the misfortune of hitting a guard’s head, knocking him unconscious. What followed was chaos as the guards opened fire on the mob. Yona and Rutherford were told to remain within the Khuraltai for their own safety.\n\nSuddenly, the doors of the Khuraltai were forced open by a company of yak soldiers, dressed in bright red with rifles pointed at the two. "Yona scared...what’s going on?" Yona asked Rutherford, her hooves shaking in a panic. She had never been threatened like this before.\n\nAn imposing brown yak stomped his way to the front of his line of soldiers, raising a hoof to command them to lower their weapons. "Yngvar comes with simple request," Yngvar stated with a surprising coolness unexpected for his size. "Step down, or else yaks will make you target practice."\n\n"Thyra not with you?" Rutherford replied, ignoring Yngvar’s threat.\n\n"Thyra’s ways have failed," Yngvar snorted. "Silly of Thyra to think that reactionaries will give up power peacefully. Yakyakistan needs new yak leader. Yak who is able to make difficult decisions rather than listen to endless arguing. From now on, Yakyakistan led by the Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army!"\n\nRutherford raised his hoof in resignation. It was either that or both Yona and him in a grave. "Rutherford will abdicate. But Yngvar will bring Yakyakistan down a violent path," Rutherford grumbled beneath his breath. "Just...just do not hurt Yona.""

 newyaks.17.d:0 "Yona and Prince Rutherford stared at the sizable group of revolutionaries that had followed Thyra into the Khuraltai.

"What is meaning of this?" Rutherford exclaimed with a stomp of his hoof.\n\nThyra placed a scroll of paper onto the round table. "Thyra come with ultimatum. Protests not only happen in Yakistown, but across Kingdom too. Many yaks blame Rutherford for heavy bloodshed against Jaki-Clan. If Prince not abdicate..." – Thyra stared firmly at Rutherford – "the Revolution will do it for Prince."\n\nYona glanced uncomfortably at Rutherford. She felt like both of them had been backed into a corner, but if Thyra was willing to enter the Khuraltai unarmed, perhaps there was still room for negotiation. "Thyra is still good yak. If Prince abdicates, will Thyra and communists not hurt harmonists?" she asked.\n\nThyra nodded and placed the pen down in front of Rutherford. "Thyra will not persecute harmonists. But Thyra will become new President. Harmonists may get representation if they work within new republic’s system," she agreed.\n\nPrince Rutherford grumbled for a moment before sighing and looking at the space where he would sign his name.

But..."–she pointed to the bottom of the paper–"some yaks blame Rutherford for yaks losing lives against Jaki-Clan."\n\nYona looked at Rutherford. She had an idea, though it was not one that the prince would like. She then turned to Thyra. "If Prince steps down, will Thyra will agree to fight for friendship and harmony?" she proposed. "Yona does not want more fighting between yaks."\n\nPrince Rutherford stared in surprise and slammed his hoof. "Yona think yak will accept this?"\n\n"Yona think that Prince should step down. For good of all Yakyakistan," Yona returned. "Yaks can form republic. Shouldn't all yaks have say in how to run Yakyakistan?"\n\nThyra nodded and placed her hoof to her chest. "All this time, Thyra just want worker yaks to run Yakyakistan. Republic is boor-zwah-zee idea, but if socialist yaks can join, yak do not see problem," she said. "Plus, Marks just pony, not yak.

Yaks do not want revolution, especially after many yaks lose lives to Jaki-Clan. Protest lose momentum, and rest of yaks leave. It is obvious that many yaks support Prince."\n\nYona looked at the melancholic Thyra and walked towards the Ghenikhan revolutionary, before finally raising a hoof in reconciliation. "This does not have to be end for Thyra. Thyra can join Yona and Prince and work together to make worker yak lives better," Yona proposed with a smile. "One yak strong. But many yaks stronger together. Yona learn that from pony friends."\n\nThyra blinked at Yona and took a deep breath. She recalled the reason why she became a Marksist – it was to make the lives of common yaks free from exploitation and share the prosperity of industry.

 yakistan.31.d:0 "Prince Rutherford stood beside the ceremonial fire pit in Yakistown, speaking with his subjects and watching them go about their days. Every yak was talking about the Jaki Secession Crisis, but their Prince wasn't overly concerned.\n\nRutherford knew better than anyone how desperate the Jaki-Clan's situation must be. They barely had enough soldiers to defend their small domain, and they stood no chance against him on the battlefield. He wouldn't be surprised if the Jaki and his traitorous brother Bradford surrendered before the year's end.\n\n"Prince Rutherford..." said a messenger yak, looking very pale. "Yürkid Clan..."\n\n"What, Yürkid Clan upset?" the Prince scoffed, "Bah! Yürkids always upset."\n\n"No, Prince, Yürkid Clan announce secession. Elder Kerr join with Jaki-Clan."\n\n"More traitors? YAKS DESTROY!" The messenger cowered in fear as Rutherford began furiously destroying his surroundings.\n\nRutherford tried to calm down but couldn't; this was a disaster. The Yürkids were some of Yakyakistan's fiercest warriors, and with their aid the Jaki could form a real army. This betrayal would breathe new life into the secessionist movement and may even cause other clans to defect. An all-out war was now inevitable.\n\n"Take message to clan elders!"

The Jaki-Clan hadn't thought Rutherford would attack so soon, and their warriors weren't ready. Bradford wouldn't be able to do much on his own, but his presence would help boost morale for the few Jaki defenders.\n\nSilhouettes appeared on the horizon. As they approached Bradford could make out the banners of the Yürkid Clan. When they came in closer he realized none of them had their weapons at the ready. Kerr, the clan elder, was at the front.\n\n"Prince Bradford!" Kerr called out across the snowy ground, "Yak want to talk!"\n\nSurprised, Bradford came out to meet him, telling his guards to stay behind.\nKerr smiled at this brazen display. "Rutherford is pony-loving traitor, Yürkid yaks serve him no longer. Yürkids pledge loyalty to Bradford, true Prince of Yakyakistan!"\n\nPrince Bradford smiled back jubilantly. This was the miracle he and the Jaki had been waiting for!\n\n"Prince yak accept pledge. Yürkids and Jakis will defeat Rutherford, restore true yak spirit!""

 POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of February, 967 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_KARSAK_SUKHBATAAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of October, 970 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yngvar has had a long and successful career in the Ghenikhan clan army, from infantry grunt to commander. Heavily influenced by Thyra's radical rhetoric, he hates the rich who exploit the worker, the priests who brainwash them, and the royalty who rule them. He supported her popular protest against Rutherford, but when she condemned the violence it produced, he knew she was too soft for the business of revolution.\n\nNow he steers the ship of state alone, a red autocrat, and he intends to march Yakyakistan to glory and free the rest of the workers of the North - whether they like it or not. And in pursuit of this great and noble goal, no method will be too extreme. The Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army will see the North liberated, no matter what it takes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
 POLITICS_OVLIINKHUVISGAL_ELBEGDORJ_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 959 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Thyra is a polarizing name in Yakyakistan. As often called a traitor as a hero, she studied at Stalliongrad for years, and saw both how brilliant Steel Stallion's leadership was and how it disintegrated after his death. Would this be the fate of every communist revolution? Distraught, she returned to the peasants, and saw their councils taking charge. She formulated a new thesis then: the vanguard party could not be the basis of communism. Only the workers themselves could liberate themselves, and the councils would be the core of this.\n\nWhen Rutherford reunited Yakyakistan, she knew the time was ripe to free the yaks. She organized a peaceful protest in the capital, and persuaded him to abdicate and let her form a new government in return for some promises to treat the harmonists of Yakyakistan well. Now the time has come to form a Northern Republic of Councils, so that all the peoples of North Equus might be truly free.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_YONA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of December, 990 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yona is a young, eager, and bright yak, who loves her home and her people. From a humble family, she volunteered to visit Princess Twilight's School of Friendship, where she became good friends with five other students, especially a pony named Sandbar.\n\nShe's a bit overwhelmed by the responsibility, but she's sworn to do her friends proud. Rutherford may no longer be Prince, but he's still a valued friend and she often finds herself consulting with him. If only the world could know peace, rather than the constant fighting that the extremists seem to be imposing on them.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_KHAN_KOLETIV_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 962 in Bara'dur.\n\n§YBiography§!: Kerr is the leader of the Yürkids, the most militaristic and expansionist of the clans, and a onetime friend of Prince Bradford's. Unfortunately, politics must always come before friendship, and Bradford would have led Yakyakistan to ruin through his tepid isolationism. How could he not see the growing threats on the continent? The changelings would never be content to have the yaks as a neutral nation, and nor would the ponies let the enclave live in peace with Rutherford and Yona slandering them. No, only by massively expanding the army and striking first can the yaks be safe. By proclaiming himself Khan, Kerr has thrown a gauntlet at the rulers of North Equus--no more will the yaks just accept the attacks against them. No longer will the yaks cower. No, from now on, it will be those others who cower at the yaks' hooves!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"
