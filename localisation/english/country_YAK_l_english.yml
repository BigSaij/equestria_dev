 newyaks.3.d:0 "The Khuraltai, or clan assembly, is where the elders of all yak clans gather to decide issues of national importance. In most other nations such a meeting would be filled with calm and respectful deliberations between seasoned political leaders.\n\nBut this was Yakyakistan, and this assembly was anything but calm and respectful.\n\n"Kiyatukh Clan harvesting vanilla beans in Mankhutayid Clan land!" Shouted Menggei, elder of the Mankhutayids. "This disgraceful! Kiyatukh Clan must be punished!"\nWithout waiting for Menggei to yield the floor, the Kiyatukh elder fired back. "Mankhutayid yak lies! Southern valley always belong to Kiyatukh Clan, other yaks just jealous!"\n\nMany other clan elders weren't even paying attention, too busy stomping or butting horns with each other. Thyra, the Ghenikhan Clan's representative, looked on in disgust. The seats for the Yürkid Clan elders were conspicuously empty.\n\n"Yaks be quiet!" Prince Rutherford said with a snort, "Yak called this Khuraltai to plan war against Jaki Clan traitors, not to hear clan elders bicker like calves!"\n\n"Why should yaks help Prince Rutherford?" the Kiyatukh elder sneered, "Prince yak has no respect for clan autonomy!"\n"Yak right! Prince Rutherford act more like pony than yak!"\n"At least Jaki Clan respect yak traditions!"\n\nPrince Rutherford growled. Trying to force the elders into line alone was clearly a lost cause. To survive the coming war he needed an ally, a clan willing to help that didn't have to be bribed into supporting his reforms."
 newyaks.3.a:0 "And only one clan came to mind..."

 newyaks.4.t:0 "The Prince"
 newyaks.4.d:0 ""YAKS DESTROY!" Yelled Prince Rutherford, splitting a log with his hooves.\n\nWhenever the Prince needed a break from the stress of ruling, he always made his way to the Yakistown smashing grounds. Turning wood into splinters cleared his head like nothing else. After smashing through another log with his forehead, Rutherford stopped to catch his breath. He looked around at his retainers, each one stomping through their own pile.\n\n"Yojan!" he exclaimed, "That perfect angle for optimal smashing! Excellent work."\n\nYojan smiled in surprise. "Yak honored, but still need to improve. Yak not smash as good as Prince yak."\n\n"Of course not! As Prince of All Yaks, yak best at smashing! Even when Prince was little yak, Prince always smash better than brother Bradford."\n\nSuddenly Rutherford paused, an unhappy thought intruding into his mind. "Yak and brother Bradford were close friends. When yak became Prince, yak spend less time with Bradford. Prince knew Bradford unhappy with reforms, but never imagined Bradford would go so far..."\n\nYojan looked concerned. "Maybe it not too late? Prince yak can still talk with brother-"\n\n"NO!" Rutherford yelled, his eyes filling with rage. "Brother Bradford is TRAITOR! Bradford conspire with Jaki Clan, destroy unity of Yakyakistan, shed blood of loyal yaks! As Prince, yak must destroy Bradford and Jaki Clan, no matter the cost!""

Smiling and waving politely, she continued walking towards the Yakistown market. Her siblings, walking beside her, were much more enthusiastic.\n\n"Yona is hero yak!" said her little sister, "Yona went to pony school, learned from pony princess!"\n"And Yona defeat evil pony!" added her little brother.\n\n"That not true," she replied, "Yona not save day alone, had help from friends. Yona only did what any yak would do."\n\nAfter the trio finished shopping they made their way home. They were greeted by a crowd of younger yaks waiting outside their house.\n\nOne of the youths stepped forward and said, "Yaks form volunteer battalion, train to fight war against Jaki-Clan. Yaks fight for friendship and harmony in Yakyakistan. Yaks want Yona to lead us!"\n\n"Yona accept." She replied without hesitation.\n\nThe young volunteers and Yona's brother were excited, but her sister realized the danger. "War scary. Yona not have to fight." she pleaded.\n\n"Yes Yona do. Ponies taught Yona that friendship can be hard, but friendship always worth fighting for.""

 newyaks.6.t:0 "The Firebrand"
 newyaks.6.d:0 "In all societies throughout history, the vast majority of creatures have been peasants. Yaks, ponies and griffons alike eked out a meager existence on farms, surrendering their surplus to the ruling class. The peasant life kept creatures isolated and ignorant, making broad-based organization impossible. This was why Caramel Marks called them "a sack of potatoes."\n\nThen the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Creatures transitioned to factory work, throwing feudal class relations into chaos. And now, at long last, that change had come to Yakyakistan.\n\nAs Thyra and her comrades marched through the valley, vibrant green fields gave way to dull gray walls and plumes of black smoke. She smiled to herself. The factory wasn't exactly pretty, but it was the harbinger of a brighter future. A future that belonged to the workers toiling inside.\n\nThe dismissal bell chimed. As the yaks finished up their manager, some stooge appointed by Rutherford, made an announcement.\n"Yaks not meet quota again. Tomorrow yaks must start 1 hour early!"\n\nBoos and jeers rang out across the factory floor. When the workers filed out Thyra and her organizers slipped into the crowd.\n"This ridiculous!" huffed one yak worker, "Boss yak ask for the impossible."\n"Boss yak sit around all day," said another, "Has no idea how factory works!"\n\n"Worker yaks right." Thyra said, grinning ever wider. "Wouldn't factory be better if yak workers ran it themselves?""

 newyaks.7.t:0 "The Officer"
 newyaks.7.d:0 "At a training camp in the mountains outside Yakistown, new recruits were practicing at the firing range. The drill instructor, a yak named Yngvar, walked among them and harshly critiqued each one. If he didn't find fault with their aim it was the way they held the rifles, or their posture while shooting.\n\nMost of Yngvar's trainees were clanless, hailing from poor families on the margins of yak society. Unlike most commanders he actually preferred yaks of humble origins. When his recruits lacked the arrogance of the great clans it was easier to break them down and mold them into proper soldiers.\n\nYngvar noticed that one recruit had stopped firing his breech loader, a sullen expression on his face.\n\n"What problem?" Yngvar asked.\n\n"Yak not see point. Gun slow and hard to aim, never defeat charge of yak warriors."\n\nYngvar didn't respond immediately. He reached for the modern bolt action rifle on his back, brought it forward and aimed at the target, a barrel of hay. He unloaded the entire magazine into the hay, scoring a direct hit with every shot. The trainees looked on in stunned silence.\n\n"Old ways of war not work anymore. To be strong yaks must learn modern tactics, like aiming. Now back to practice, or else yak will be next target!""

 newyaks.8.t:0 "Yakyakistan Requests Military Aid"
 newyaks.8.d:0 "Winter Frost cast an uneasy glance at the yak in front of her. The Committee on Revolution in North Equus very rarely received petitioners, and had never heard a request like this one.\n\n"So to summarize," she said, trying to keep her tone neutral, "you want us to provide military aid to Prince Rutherford, an absolute monarch with ties to Equestria? I'm sorry, but that would require completely ignoring our strategic interests, not to mention all of communist theory."\n\nThe yak smiled back unfazed. "Not true, comrade pony! By opening up Yakyakistan to Equestrian trade Prince Rutherford began yak bourgeois democratic revolution. Yaks need this so yaks can have second, proletarian socialist revolution."\n\nWinter's jaw dropped. She had not expected the yak to be well versed in theory.\n\n"If yaks win upcoming war with Stalliongrad ponies help, communist yaks can make attempt to overthrow Rutherford. If ponies not help and Jaki-Clan win, all yak economic progress will be erased and Yakyakistan will become reactionary stronghold in North Equus. Choice is yours, can yaks count on comrade ponies?""
 newyaks.8.a:0 "For now, we'll work with the Prince."
 newyaks.8.b:0 "No compromise with monarchists."

 newyaks.9.t:0 "Red Army Advisors Arrive"
 newyaks.9.d:0 ""Yaks thank communist ponies for helping," Prince Rutherford said to the newly arrived volunteers from Stalliongrad, "But remember: Yakyakistan not communist country. Prince Rutherford still in charge. Ponies better not break Prince's rules, or else!"\n\nThe mares and stallions of the Red Army rolled their eyes at this display. Here they were, risking their necks to help the yaks win their civil war, and this reactionary monarch had the gaul to threaten them? Talk about getting off on the wrong hoof.\n\nAs Rutherford walked away Thyra took his place. Her bright smile contrasted sharply with the Prince's scowl.\n\n"Comrade ponies no worry about Prince yak. Prince all talk and no action, just like pony Princess!"\n\nThat got a laugh from all the volunteers. With the ice now broken, Thyra began explaining their assignment. They were to assist Yakyakistan's fledgling army, training new recruits to use modern weapons and tactics. If the ponies also happened to tell the yak soldiers about Marksism and the Revolution in Stalliongrad, that was good too. No one would tell the Prince."
 newyaks.9.a:0 "In snowy mountains a red flower blooms."

 newyaks.10.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"

Prince Rutherford said with a smile, "Hah! Yaks no need their help. Yak warriors will fight Jaki-Clan traitors alone!"\n\nWhen Thyra heard the news she was dismayed, but mostly annoyed. She had always believed the ponies of Stalliongrad were sincere in their desire to spread the revolution. Refusing to help their yak comrades was quite the slap in the face."
 newyaks.10.a:0 "What's even the point?"

 newyaks.11.t:0 "Yakyakistan Requests Civilian Aid"
 newyaks.11.d:0 "Winter Frost shuffled some paperwork aside and turned her attention to the yak in the room. With a civil war in Yakyakistan looming, their visits were becoming a common occurrence.\n\n"Ok, let's see here. Prince Rutherford, not content with asking us for military aid, is now requesting technical experts to build up Yakyakistan's nascent industries. And I suppose you're going to quote me some theory to explain why granting this isn't completely asinine?"\n\nThe yak gave a sheepish grin. "Well, yaks mostly need industry help to win civil war, but it good for communist reasons too. As yak industry expands, will need more yak workers. These workers, called industrial proletariat, will lead future socialist revolution! And with Stalliongrad ponies help, yaks can raise class consciousness of workers very fast."\n\nWinter smirked. "Not a bad argument, but this isn't exactly an open and shut case. I'll call the committee to a vote.""
 newyaks.11.a:0 "We can spare some bureaucrats and engineers."

 newyaks.12.t:0 "The Spectre of Communism"
 newyaks.12.d:0 "Thyra watched with glee as another plane came in from Stalliongrad. As it landed she busied herself directing the new arrivals to their destinations: bureaucrats to the government hut, engineers to the factories, etc.\n\nWith every passing day more ponies from Stalliongrad arrived, and every day they introduced new technologies and forms of administration to Yakyakistan. Thyra had dreamed of dragging her country into modernity for a long time, kicking and screaming if necessary. She was glad her old comrades were willing to help speed up that process.\n\nOn the far end of the dirt runway, Prince Rutherford looked on in mounting horror. Every day the communist plague spread further, infecting yaks throughout his government and military. He knew that Thyra and Stalliongrad were planning to overthrow him when the war was over. Once he thought their challenge would be easy to crush, but now he wasn't so sure."

Rutherford said, grinning, "Yaks not need their help! Yaks modernize all on our own."\n\nOn the other side of the room Thyra made a face. Her comrades had really let her down this time. She wanted nothing more than to drag Yakyakistan into modernity, but her plans relied on help from a modern industrial state. Without that everything was going to be much harder."
 newyaks.13.a:0 "Why did we bother asking?"

 newyaks.14.t:0 "An Old Friend"
 newyaks.14.d:0 "Prince Rutherford removed the record from the gramophone after the last melody faded out. The device was a gift from one of Pinkie Pie's friends, Spike. The music was a brief retreat from the hectic affairs of the Khuraltai, though somepony else had arrived to brighten the Prince’s mood.\n\n"Wow! You can't believe how long it took me to get here! I didn't know trotting through the Crystal Mountains would take so long and all-"\n\n"Pink pony!" Rutherford suddenly hugged Pinkie Pie, causing the earth pony to cough from the force. "Yak not see pink pony for several moons!"\n\nRutherford soon let go of the hug. "Honored to meet you, Prince! Now, I've heard you got a teensy-weensy problem with your brother and all..."\n\n"Pink pony talk of traitor brother Bradford?" he snorted.\n\n"Yeah! I mean, I have a family of my own, with my sisters Maud, Limestone, and Marble Pie," Pinkie answered with a hop. "We sometimes get arguments between each other, but it's nothing a little talk can't sort out. What I'm sayin' and all is, we can avoid a lot of yaks getting hurt."\n\nRutherford grumbled under his breath. What Pinkie Pie said was similar to what some of his fellow yaks had said. "Not possible. Bradford not see reason. Never will."\n\nPinkie sank for a moment before brightening up again, suddenly pulling out a stack of vanilla cake. "On another note... I know being a Prince is hard and all, so I brought a little something extra from back home, straight from Sugarcube Corner!" Pinkie added.\n\nThe prince's mood quickly lightened up as he briefly looked at the cake and gulped it in one bite. "Pony cake good. Yak like!" he said after swallowing the cake whole."

 newyaks.16.d:0 "Yona grimaced at the papers she had just received. The protests in Yakistown had grown in size, with thousands of angry yaks calling for the overthrow of Prince Rutherford. It didn’t take long for the protests to get violent; the mob threw chunks of stone covered in ice at the guards, and one had the misfortune of hitting a guard’s head, knocking him unconscious. What followed was chaos as the guards opened fire on the mob. Yona and Rutherford were told to remain within the Khuraltai for their own safety.\n\nSuddenly, the doors of the Khuraltai were forced open by a company of yak soldiers, dressed in bright red with rifles pointed at the two. "Yona scared...what’s going on?" Yona asked Rutherford, her hooves shaking in a panic. She had never been threatened like this before.\n\nAn imposing brown yak stomped his way to the front of his line of soldiers, raising a hoof to command them to lower their weapons. "Yngvar comes with simple request," Yngvar stated with a surprising coolness unexpected for his size. "Step down, or else yaks will make you target practice."\n\n"Thyra not with you?" Rutherford replied, ignoring Yngvar’s threat.\n\n"Thyra’s ways have failed," Yngvar snorted. "Silly of Thyra to think that reactionaries will give up power peacefully. Yakyakistan needs new yak leader. Yak who is able to make difficult decisions rather than listen to endless arguing. From now on, Yakyakistan led by the Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army!"\n\nRutherford raised his hoof in resignation. It was either that or both Yona and him in a grave. "Rutherford will abdicate. But Yngvar will bring Yakyakistan down a violent path," Rutherford grumbled beneath his breath. "Just...just do not hurt Yona.""

 newyaks.17.t:0 "The People's Will Reigns Supreme"
 newyaks.17.d:0 "Yona and Prince Rutherford stared at the sizable group of revolutionaries that had followed Thyra into the Khuraltai. Yona had proposed a meeting to avoid an almost certain revolution from occurring. While most of the revolutionaries were unarmed, it felt more like a coup to Prince Rutherford. "What is meaning of this?" Rutherford exclaimed with a stomp of his hoof.\n\nThyra placed a scroll of paper onto the round table. "Thyra come with ultimatum. Protests not only happen in Yakistown, but across Kingdom too. Many yaks blame Rutherford for heavy bloodshed against Jaki-Clan. If Prince not abdicate..." – Thyra stared firmly at Rutherford – "the Revolution will do it for Prince."\n\nYona glanced uncomfortably at Rutherford. She felt like both of them had been backed into a corner, but if Thyra was willing to enter the Khuraltai unarmed, perhaps there was still room for negotiation. "Thyra is still good yak. If Prince abdicates, will Thyra and communists not hurt harmonists?" she asked.\n\nThyra nodded and placed the pen down in front of Rutherford. "Thyra will not persecute harmonists. But Thyra will become new President. Harmonists may get representation if they work within new republic’s system," she agreed.\n\nPrince Rutherford grumbled for a moment before sighing and looking at the space where he would sign his name. He didn’t have a choice. "For good of all Yakyakistan... Prince will step down. Yakyakistan needs no more violence.""

But..." –she pointed to the bottom of the paper– "some yaks blame Rutherford for yaks losing lives against Jaki-Clan."\n\nYona looked at Rutherford. She had an idea, though it was not one that the prince would like. She then turned to Thyra. "If Prince steps down, will Thyra will agree to fight for friendship and harmony?" she proposed. "Yona does not want more fighting between yaks."\n\nPrince Rutherford stared in surprise and slammed his hoof. "Yona think yak will accept this?"\n\n"Yona think that Prince should step down. For good of all Yakyakistan," Yona returned. "Yaks can form republic. Shouldn't all yaks have say in how to run Yakyakistan?"\n\nThyra nodded and placed her hoof to her chest. "All this time, Thyra just want worker yaks to run Yakyakistan. Republic is boor-zwah-zee idea, but if socialist yaks can join, yak do not see problem," she said. "Plus, Marks just pony, not yak. Pony words of revolution not always right."\n\nPrince Rutherford grumbled before he surprisingly calmed down.

Yaks do not want revolution, especially after many yaks lose lives to Jaki-Clan. Protest lose momentum, and rest of yaks leave. It is obvious that many yaks support Prince."\n\nYona looked at the melancholic Thyra and walked towards the Ghenikhan revolutionary, before finally raising a hoof in reconciliation. "This does not have to be end for Thyra. Thyra can join Yona and Prince and work together to make worker yak lives better," Yona proposed with a smile. "One yak strong. But many yaks stronger together. Yona learn that from pony friends."\n\nThyra blinked at Yona and took a deep breath. She recalled the reason why she became a Marksist – it was to make the lives of common yaks free from exploitation and share the prosperity of industry. But with yaks like Prince Rutherford being receptive to reform, maybe it was possible to bring about change from the inside."

 newyaks.20.d:0 "The ancient saying goes "if things not perfect, yaks get mad", but judging by the happiness reigning in Yakistown, everything was as close to perfection as it could possibly be. With the country slowly recovering from the conflict, a festive period had been proclaimed by the authorities, and the coronation of Prince Rutherford was set as the centerpiece of the celebrations.\n\nSome could say that the Prince already had a ceremony, or that resources devoted to it could be better spent elsewhere, but these opinions were clearly in minority. The nation, once again united under Rutherford’s banner, cheered its leader on, and so the elders of loyalist clans as well as the new, more agreeable representatives of the ones recently smashed gathered in the capital to take part in the proceedings.\n\nAlthough his father carried the title of a king, Rutherford did not consider it proper to follow up on this, especially with the course towards harmony. Thus, in the ancient shrine atop a sacred mountain peak, after a long-horned shaman wiped the steel crown with fresh snow and sang the hymns of renewal, a voice of the true prince boomed over the crowd of nobles and invited foreign dignitaries.\n\n"Khuraltai yaks! Afar friends! Our land stand true, in harmony! Yaks become stronger, smarter! Me honored to guide them!" Decisively, he placed the crown on his head. It felt cold and somehow heavier than before, but Rutherford never shied from any burden."

 newyaks.21.d:0 "Despite the end of the overt hostilities, a certain unease could be felt throughout Yakyakistan. The process of harmonic reforms started by Prince Rutherford snowballed into something global, sidelining its own founder and creating an outlet for itself in the form of national elections. The idea of a chosen government was close to the clan tradition of family heads appointing their leaders, but now every yak had a chance to shape the future of their own country with a thump of a hoof.\n\nYona observed the proceedings with great apprehension. Not only was she the very yak who in the critical moment swayed the direction of the state towards these uncharted ranges, she had also joined the race for the post of the chairyak for the new Khural - for her it was the path clearly dictated by duty. As a candidate, she was not allowed to work at polling stations in any capacity, so instead Yona spent the day at home, enjoying a calm moment with her family.\n\nLate in the evening, when all the chores were done twice over and a few hours after her little siblings were tucked away in beds, a guest came to visit. It was a stocky yak by the name of Nir, formerly a volunteer under Yona’s command, and now one of the members of her political team.\n\n"Results now in! Number yaks counted hard!" Enthusiastic enough to forget the greetings, Nir spoke loudly as soon as Yona opened the front door.\n\nShe raised the hoof telling him to quiet down, and then slipped outside. "Please not Yngvar. Thyra had great campaign, should be her. Maybe..." Whispering loudly, she was swept up by the same excitement, but Nir interrupted her before she could continue.\n\n"Not Yngvar! Not Thyra!

One was visiting, the other was confined here, one was older, the other was younger, one was crowned, the other was disgraced, and even though they shared the same sadness, it was of shattered kinship.\n\nRutherford spoke first, his voice low and his mind focused. It was the first time he came here, as he spent dozens of moons thinking, weighing the words and the options.\n\n"Traitor prince Bradford judged by clans and ancient spirits. Some call for blood, some say banishment, few kind yaks believe in forgiveness. Much chaos on the madyak's hooves, many lives broken."\n\n"Brother strong." Averting his gaze, Bradford snorted. "Lost his way to ponies, set yaks on same path, but mighty, willful. No need to listen to elders, consult shamans - should pass sentence, like true yak chieftains did."\n\nThere was silence for a while, and Rutherford continued to stare at his fallen sibling until the other yak raised the head and met his glare once more. In the dark eyes, covered in part by unkempt brown fur, the true prince could see his own reflection. He remembered it looking young and happy when they played together in the snow, proud and stubborn when they politicked in Khuraltai or carefree and cheerful during Yickslurbertfests. He also recalled it being hurt and angry when Bradford smashed the gifts from the Equestrian diplomatic mission before storming off to Saihan Tolgod. Here and now, however, it was a reflection of someone ready for a decision."

Thus, the leaders of the yak secessionists were judged in the expediently established High Court, comprising representatives of the influential political movements. Unsurprisingly, the variety of opinions between them guaranteed that decisions on punishments would be carefully devised compromises, and for many, including Prince Bradford, the result took the form of banishment.\n\nYona did know Rutherford's wayward brother personally, even if she could not say much good about him - after all, the deposed prince went from vehemently opposing any reform and positive diplomacy, including her enrollment in the School of Friendship, to plunging Yakyakistan into a bloody war. Still, she wanted to oversee his departure personally, both as a symbol of renewal and to support Rutherford.\n\nThe smaller terminal of Yakistown train station was cordoned off for the proceedings, and the platform housing the armored train was guarded by an additional squad of police. Allowing Rutherford and Bradford to talk privately, Yona kept her distance, only occasionally glancing towards them. The farewell was cut short as the older yak thumped his hooves, loudly scoffed and went back inside. When Yona hurried to catch up with him, the remaining brother called out to her.\n\n"Braided yak cunning, like pony. Stole power, kept fur clean. Should be proud." Bradford's words rang with bitterness.\n\nThere was a lot she could say back, on battles she fought, on companions lost, on guilt or on sacrifices. Instead, she picked a different way.\n\n"Prince should go, see more, learn more. One day return to best, strongest Yakyakistan.""

Such mystical rumors were finally disproved when a daring brigade of volunteers assaulted Star Mountain's hideout, discovering scores of bloody trophies and barely taking her alive.\n\nIt turned out that the experience did little to quell her temper, and even before the transfer from a prison hospital to a regular incarceration facility, Star Mountain picked several bloody fights with the guards, making a physical barrier for the meeting a sensible measure. When the prince arrived, the wardens opened a small slit in the cell door, allowing Rutherford to take a look at the captive. A blond-maned pony sat atop the straw bed haughtily, her head following the clanging sound. As soon as she was able to realize who was standing on the other side, Star Mountain jumped up closer.\n\n"Socialist pawn! Marksist puppet! Came here to gloat on behalf of your masters?" She was screeching, almost frothing at the mouth. "Oh, I have something to tell them!"\n\nUnfazed, Rutherford made a swiping gesture with his hoof, and the wardens shut the hole back, muffling the crescending rant."
 newyaks.81.a:0 ""Mad one stay as she is. Maybe pony friends talk to their own.""

 newyaks.82.t:0 "Building Coalition"
 newyaks.82.d:0 "Despite ruling over the Yürkids with iron hoof for years, or possibly thanks to his unprecedented authority, elder Kerr wielded significant support among his clan members, and many perceived casting him out as an outright insult. Still, Yona approved of the sentence and was eager to join the government delegation to Bara’dur to ensure the integrity of the country.\n\nThere were a few factors in her favor, namely the general weariness from the war, the sharp drop in Kerr's popularity after his defeat in strict accordance with his own "rule of the strong'' idea, and the lack of clear successor, as it seemed that the long-horned chief had no intention of leaving his position. Knowing well that she will not be able to completely uproot the local ways of thinking, Yona focused on the next best thing - ensuring that the new leader would be forthright and ready to earnestly join Khuraltai by engaging in practical diplomacy, from personal meetings to public "agi-tai-shun", the latter being a neat trick borrowed from Thyra’s tactics.\n\nA young warrior by the name of Royznbarg was the single suitable candidate, respected for her prowess on the battlefield and reputed to be honorable due to her actions before the ceasefire, negotiating a fair surrender for her banner-force and a safe passage for Yürkid non-combatants. After a short, but intense back-and-forth she accepted the support of the harmonists, proceeding to beat the disjointed competition quite soundly and declare her intention to be "voice of clan in yak unity". When Yona was departing, for the demonstrated efforts Royznbarg even considered her worthy of a farewell horn bump!"

 newyaks.83.t:0 "Strange Ways"
 newyaks.83.d:0 ""In the end, I’m a pony who had enough punch to be true yak’s equal." Star Mountain squinted and Yona and then spitted on the ground. "And you are a yak who wasted her life to be a worse pony imitation."\n\nThe sentencing of the most unusual rebel commander was one of the few which could conceivably have a different outcome. Many members of the High Court, especially those from the Ghenikhan clan, pushed strongly for a harsher penalty in response to the campaign of bloody terror wrought by the "Severyanian madmare", up to and including a public execution. Although Yona was glad that the calmer voices prevailed, she feared that the banishment was not that much better of an alternative - after weathering the scornful semi-coherent sermon, the young chairyak became even more convinced that Star Mountain truly needed some kind of help, not isolation alongside her followers.\n\n"Nothing to say, huh? You communist patsies are all the same, can only repeat after your stupid little books or the dumb painted slogans." Changing her tone between disdainful and mocking, the pony carried on. "Don’t worry, we’ll have some words of our own when we come back from the north."\n\nIndeed, what was there to say? Could a phrase or two or a hundred make a difference? Mustering all her willpower, remembering all the lessons of the School of Friendship, Yona finally answered, right as the military police trucks were driving inside the prison courtyard to collect the exiles for their transportation."
 newyaks.83.a:0 "Only stars knew if she was heard."

 newyaks.84.t:0 "White Banner"
 newyaks.84.d:0 "A very curious group of creatures has recently crossed our southern border, all of them formerly a part of a military unit involved in the recent Yakyakistan civil war. They have been banished from the country in its aftermath, not only due to fighting for the losing side, but for demonstrated ferocity and brutality, and now these exiles seek a new cause.\n\nThe fact that all of the expats are ponies, apparently of Severyanian descent and strict anti-communist outlook, makes the situation even more interesting. Their leader, one called Star Mountain, has already directed a missive to [PLB.Capital.GetName], offering us her services and expertise in return for a proper post at our chain of command and incorporation of her subordinates into the army."

 newyaks.85.t:0 "The Formation of the Agrarian Union" #Current text does not have alternative for Rutherford - Fabian
 newyaks.85.d:0 "In Thyra's eyes the post-war drop-off in the popularity of the hardline left movement was somewhat disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Yakyakistan weathered this dark storm while staying on the course towards harmony, and since its inhabitants were famously headstrong, they took it as a surefire sign to press on with the original reforms, maybe with a slight change in the specifics of leadership.\n\nOf course, Thyra was also a yak, meaning that there was no way she would abandon her struggle for the cause. Nonetheless, being stubborn did not equate to being stupid, so she had been toiling tirelessly, revising the approach towards the character of socialism in her homeland. Pressed by the need to keep up with the times, she also genuinely wanted to learn from and contribute to the forming democratic system which held the potential for many good things, especially with a suitable touch.\n\nDue to the aforementioned wilful nature of her comrades, this conciliatory route meant that the previous communist organization would have to come to an end, but Thyra quickly found that she did not lack for new allies and followers, especially among the young and the clanless. As a result of her efforts, the Yak Agrarian People's Union was born, advocating for peaceful peasant cooperatives and expanded worker rights, as well as the steady continuation of industrialization, and ready to carry the torch."

 newyaks.86.t:0 "A Smashing Plea"
 newyaks.86.d:0 "A few years ago, when the diplomatic mission sent by Prince Rutherford, ruler of Yakyakistan, toured Equestria with great success (admittedly, after a few hiccups), Princess Celestia was quite pleased with the previously isolated country finding a harmonic place in the modern world. She had personally authorized several projects aimed at the industrial development of the region, approved of supportive packages for businesses willing to undertake ventures in the north and became acquainted with Yona, the first yak student at Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship. The positive trend came crashing down recently, as a bloody war between reformists and reactionaries broke out beyond the Crystal Mountains, threatening to undo all of the progress achieved. However, yaks were not the ones to ask for assistance directly - at least that was what the princess believed until a small royal delegation once again made its way south.\n\n"True clans brought down, their banners tattered." The voice of Rutherford echoed across the audience chamber, ringing with weariness and desperation. "Snow red with blood, salted with tears."\n\n"Please, Your Majesty. Please." Repeated by Yona, this word made her prince wince, but he did not interrupt, only lowering his head further. "Yaks need guns to fight, for hope, for families, for future. Ponies did so much for us - can they help in darkest hour too?"\n\nLooking at the brave souls forced to leave their kin and beg for salvation in a strange land brought Celestia great sorrow. Still, what they sought was not kind words, but weapons, supply of which was limited at best and crucially important for the defense of her own nation."

 newyaks.87.t:0 "Yaks Request Backing in their Claims" #Current text does not have alternative for peace - Fabian
 newyaks.87.d:0 "We have received a series of secret messages from the government of Yakyakistan outlining their plan and tacitly asking assistance to pressure Nova Griffonia into returning their contested historical territories. These lands were forcefully occupied by the latter centuries ago in the colonization drive and have remained an unresolved issue for the two regimes in the modern era.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that after dealing with their internal problems our allies are seeking diplomatic support in the endeavor, but the ongoing war with the changelings makes it hard to divert political or economical resources to this project of historical revisionism in the less-than-stable north and brings about a risk of aligning griffons closer to the cause of our enemies. Moreover, it is worth considering that our endorsement might make Yakyakistan foolhardy enough to use their armed forces, while the lack of it might cause the tensions to reach a similar breaking point by themselves."
 newyaks.87.a:0 "We will issue a statement in favor of the yaks."

At the same time, there exists a possibility that yaks will continue pressing this issue in a less civilized manner if we refuse."

 newyaks.91.d:0 "Tired from traveling from all corners of the world, the group of once "dangerous and unpredictable creatures", as the six prominent students of the School of Friendship were named by the more conceited staff members, agreed on properly meeting after some freshening up. Gallus, Silverstream, Ladybug, Smolder, and Sandbar, the one who invited them all in for a little reunion - Yona felt weird seeing them after so much time and so many things. She was rather restless, startled by the warm, yet awkward greetings, so she wandered the place, trying to wrap her head around being here again.\n\nA sudden clanging sound brought her out of the contemplation. As Yona tried to determine its origin, a hushed curse followed the racket from a room to her left.\n\n"Ladybug alright there?" Recognising the voice of her shy friend, the yak peeked inside without waiting for an answer. To her surprise, there was no pony in sight, just a startled changeling. The stranger flapped her wings, mumbled something and then, before Yona's very eyes transformed into Ladybug and back.\n\n"I'm sorry... I can explain. Just come in, please!" With each word, the desperation of the changeling increased noticeably.\n\n"Talk. Promise to hear out." Cautiously, Yona entered the chamber and closed the door.\n\nLadybug or, going by her true name, Ocellus, talked as prompted, about everything - hive childhood, selection for duty, covert mission to the School and the chaotic web of circumstances, feelings and considerations which allowed her to go back willingly. Not all of these revelations sat well with Yona, but she could make out her old friend obscured behind them, remorseful and scared, shaking from the pouring truth, obviously different, but so very familiar, just as the School itself."

Sitting together around the fire late into the night, all of them had turned a bit sleepy and a little dreamy. Meanwhile, the flames danced, the smoke soared and magic was weaving its threads through the air, the rare type of spell born in a truly close circle of creatures.\n\n"We do live in an interesting time, don’t we?" Speaking in a relaxed manner, a stallion with a turtle cutie mark smiled. "It’s good to be here, though. Remember what you said at graduation, Smolder?"\n\n"In fact I do remember, Sandbar." The dragon parodied his tone and then playfully poked the pony with her elbow. "Something along the lines of exams, homeworks and this whole place going ablaze. And that I will miss you bunch dearly. So I did."\n\n"Isn’t it great that it did not go ablaze? I mean, I know it was a metaphor." Silverstream, a hippogriff and the final member of the merry six after Yona and Ocellus, quickly glanced towards the School building. "But then there is a certain spark..."\n\nThe banter went on and Yona listened closely, allowing the reality to blend with her old memories. In her opinion, she had talked enough for now, especially after a barrage of questions everyone had for the latest head of yak state. This state, the country changed so much by her beliefs and actions, waited for her patiently in the north, and even though the more practical side of Yona was already setting up the plans for her return, this was the night for her other side, one not as calculating, but equally important in setting the way forward for her kin.

 yakistan.47.d:0 "When Prince Bradford heard about troop movements to the north he rushed there as fast as he could. The Jaki-Clan hadn't thought Rutherford would attack so soon, and their warriors weren't ready. Bradford wouldn't be able to do much on his own, but his presence would help boost morale for the few Jaki defenders.\n\nSilhouettes appeared on the horizon. As they approached Bradford could make out the banners of the Yürkid Clan. When they came in closer he realized none of them had their weapons at the ready. Kerr, the clan elder, was at the front.\n\n"Prince Bradford!" Kerr called out across the snowy ground, "Yak want to talk!"\n\nSurprised, Bradford came out to meet him, telling his guards to stay behind.\nKerr smiled at this brazen display. "Rutherford is pony-loving traitor, Yürkid yaks serve him no longer. Yürkids pledge loyalty to Bradford, true Prince of Yakyakistan!"\n\nPrince Bradford smiled back jubilantly. This was the miracle he and the Jaki had been waiting for!\n\n"Prince yak accept pledge. Yürkids and Jakis will defeat Rutherford, restore true yak spirit!""

While normally a Yürkid leader's rule lasts only a few years before being overthrown by a harsher, crueler successor, Kerr's has lasted since 982. It is a testament to his intelligence and skill that Rutherford did not kick him from the clan coalition when the first reports of slaughter trickled in.

 POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of February, 967 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_KARSAK_SUKHBATAAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of October, 970 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yngvar has had a long and successful career in the Ghenikhan clan army, from infantry grunt to commander. Heavily influenced by Thyra's radical rhetoric, he hates the rich who exploit the worker, the priests who brainwash them, and the royalty who rule them. He supported her popular protest against Rutherford, but when she condemned the violence it produced, he knew she was too soft for the business of revolution.\n\nNow he steers the ship of state alone, a red autocrat, and he intends to march Yakyakistan to glory and free the rest of the workers of the North - whether they like it or not. And in pursuit of this great and noble goal, no method will be too extreme. The Grand Marshal of the Invincible Red Sun Yak Army will see the North liberated, no matter what it takes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
 POLITICS_OVLIINKHUVISGAL_ELBEGDORJ_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 959 in Karsakag.\n\n§YBiography§!: Thyra is a polarizing name in Yakyakistan. As often called a traitor as a hero, she studied at Stalliongrad for years, and saw both how brilliant Steel Stallion's leadership was and how it disintegrated after his death. Would this be the fate of every communist revolution? Distraught, she returned to the peasants, and saw their councils taking charge. She formulated a new thesis then: the vanguard party could not be the basis of communism. Only the workers themselves could liberate themselves, and the councils would be the core of this.\n\nWhen Rutherford reunited Yakyakistan, she knew the time was ripe to free the yaks. She organized a peaceful protest in the capital, and persuaded him to abdicate and let her form a new government in return for some promises to treat the harmonists of Yakyakistan well. Now the time has come to form a Northern Republic of Councils, so that all the peoples of North Equus might be truly free.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_YONA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of December, 990 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: Yona is a young, eager, and bright yak, who loves her home and her people. From a humble family, she volunteered to visit Princess Twilight's School of Friendship, where she became good friends with five other students, especially a pony named Sandbar.\n\nShe's a bit overwhelmed by the responsibility, but she's sworn to do her friends proud. Rutherford may no longer be Prince, but he's still a valued friend and she often finds herself consulting with him. If only the world could know peace, rather than the constant fighting that the extremists seem to be imposing on them.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
 POLITICS_KHAN_KOLETIV_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of April, 962 in Bara'dur.\n\n§YBiography§!: Kerr is the leader of the Yürkids, the most militaristic and expansionist of the clans, and a onetime friend of Prince Bradford's. Unfortunately, politics must always come before friendship, and Bradford would have led Yakyakistan to ruin through his tepid isolationism. How could he not see the growing threats on the continent? The changelings would never be content to have the yaks as a neutral nation, and nor would the ponies let the enclave live in peace with Rutherford and Yona slandering them. No, only by massively expanding the army and striking first can the yaks be safe. By proclaiming himself Khan, Kerr has thrown a gauntlet at the rulers of North Equus--no more will the yaks just accept the attacks against them. No longer will the yaks cower. No, from now on, it will be those others who cower at the yaks' hooves!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

 YAK_evanna_boom:0 "Evanna Boom"
 YAK_EVANNA_DESC:0 "As the leader of the Süldintjid clan banner, Evanna has risen high in in military experience.

 YAK_ridoven_taini:0 "Taini"
 YAK_TAINI_DESC:0 "A Mangchijid noble, Taini is something of a hawk among the harmonists. She pushed for a harsher treatment of the Jaki-Clan, opposed the truce, and now is eager to see war looming. She utterly despises Yona, seeing her as a soft wimp who would lead Yakyakistan to ruin. But Rutherford is Prince, and nothing can be done."

 YAK_AINSLEY_DESC:0 "Arusharii's militarism is at odds with their clan leader Ainsley's calm, serene demeanor out of combat. Said to be remarkably well-spoken, he turns into a ferocious beast in combat, smashing anything in his way. Losing his allegiance would be a dire proposition."
