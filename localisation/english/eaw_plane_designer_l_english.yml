 EQ_MOD_CAT_super_large_plane_jet_engine_type_TITLE:1 "8 Jet Engines"

 jet_engine_8x:0 "8x Jet Engines"
 jet_engine_8x_desc:0 "Eight engines provide an absurd amount of thrust, for carrying an absurd amount of weapons."

 fast_jet_engine_6x:0 "6x Supersonic Jet Engine"
 fast_jet_engine_6x_desc:0 "Six engines with boron-enriched zip fuel can provide astounding speed, although at a hefty price and fuel consumption. They also take up as much space as 8 normal jet engines, thus requiring a larger airframe to mount."
 rocket_engine_4:0 "Crystal Engine I"
 rocket_engine_4_desc:0 "Similar to a rocket engine, this design uses the radical idea of liquid crystals for its power source. This increases performance, at the cost of requiring access to said crystals."
 rocket_engine_5:0 "Crystal Engine II"
 rocket_engine_5_desc:0 "More stable, faster, and overall better, this is the ultimate in short-range interceptors."

 super_large_bomb_bay:0 "Super Large Bomb Bay"
 super_large_bomb_bay_desc:0 "A massive bay to carry enough ordinance to devastate a city."
 guided_air_to_surface_missile:0 "Guided Air-to-Surface Missile"
 guided_air_to_surface_missile_desc:0 "A bomb with joystick guidance and a rocket engine, this missile is among the first true precision air-to-surface weapons."
 guided_air_to_air_missile:0 "Guided Air-to-Air Missile"
 guided_air_to_air_missile_desc:0 "A high explosive charge with a rocket engine and heat or radar guidance, this new weapon of war is a serious threat to planes currently flying."
 nuclear_air_to_air_rocket:0 "Unguided Nuclear Air-to-Air Rocket"
 nuclear_air_to_air_rocket_desc:0 "While it may seem completely insane to fire unguided nuclear rockets over our own airspace, the fact is that modern bombers are unstoppable by machine guns. With missiles still in their infancy, this rocket provides a valuable stopgap for killing strategic bombers and preventing actual nuclear strikes on our soil."
 hardpoint:0 "Hardpoint"
 hardpoint_desc:0 "Capable of mounting an autocannon, glide bombs, rockets, or even primitive missiles, this is the true multirole weapon of choice. Its chief drawback is its cost."

 small_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "This airframe is designed to take advantage of the great speeds offered by modern engines and potentially reach low transonic speeds."
 modern_small_airframe:0 "$small_plane_airframe_5$"
 modern_small_airframe_desc:0 "$small_plane_airframe_5_desc$"
 medium_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "With jet-powered planes now dominant, engineers have learned how to truly take advantage of jet propulsion."
 large_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "A more durable frame focuses on survivability, to ensure at least some bombers get through."
 super_large_plane_airframe_1:0 "Super Large Airframe"
 super_large_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Massive, unwieldy, and very long-range, this airframe can mount the largest bombs ever dropped... at a high price."

 air_ground_radar_3:0 "Air-Ground Radar III"
 air_ground_radar_3_desc:0 "Even better air-to-ground ensures a higher chance of successful hits."
 air_ground_radar_4:0 "Air-Ground Radar IV"
 air_ground_radar_4_desc:0 "The final word in aerial bombardment, this radar lets pilots ensure their payloads almost always hit even at night."
 air_air_radar_3:0 "Air-Air Radar III"
 air_air_radar_3_desc:0 "Modern radar is capable of even locating enemy fighters, instead of just bombers."
 air_air_radar_4:0 "Air-Air Radar IV"
 air_air_radar_4_desc:0 "Further advancements in radar let air superiority and interception missions reach new heights of success."

 bomb_sights_3:0 "Bomb Sights III"
 bomb_sights_3_desc:0 "Smaller, more advanced computers can perform more calculations faster."
 bomb_sights_4:0 "Bomb Sights IV"
 bomb_sights_4_desc:0 "The ultimate in bomb trajectory calculation, these all but guarantee a hit."

 hardpoints:0 "Hardpoints"
 hardpoints_desc:0 "Flexible mounts capable of holding autocannons, rockets, bombs, or missiles, what they lose in power they make up for in versatility."
