For many decades have the balance of their myriad interests worked by Mekiouzza, her sheer presence and success more than enough to keep the tribes beating to the rhythm of her drum\n\nHowever, her time is running out, and the years ever since the death of the Storm King have led to a deep gap between the tribes, and her relationship with them.\n\nIf Zarantia is to have any future to be a power within North Zebrica, Mekiouzza must unite the disparate tribes' interests with her own, lest her power slips past her hooves like the sand of the ageless desert she calls home.\n\n£house_texticon Agzhat's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Agzhat_Compliance_Text]\n\n£mountain_texticon Zinder's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zinder_Compliance_Text]\n\n£glass_texticon Zawagh's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zawagh_Compliance_Text]\n\n£textiles_texticon Zajhari's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zajhari_Compliance_Text]\n\n£caravan_texticon Shizra's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Shizra_Compliance_Text]\n\n£alchemy_texticon Senmare's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Senmare_Compliance_Text]\n\n£sea_texticon Menzaka's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Menzaka_Compliance_Text]\n\n£gunandshield_texticon Zamfara's tribes are [Root.Zarantia_Zamfara_Compliance_Text]\n\n"

 zarantia.1.t:0 "The Aguellid"
 zarantia.1.d:0 "Time was like water, flowing on endlessly, and as much as you grasped for it, it just flowed around your hooves. Even if you achieved great things, time could sweep it away so easily, leaving you standing in the ashes of your successes. As all things were born, so all things must die, and Mekiouzza Ataghan felt her age weigh down on her. Two years ago, all had been right in the world, and yet then it all had come crashing down.\n\nWas this the legacy she would leave her beloved daughter? A nation that had fled into the desert with its tail between its legs, a capitol in the hooves of criminals and warlords, and a people who had lost faith in her. Decades of work, undone in a hoofful of months.  Now she was back where she started all those years ago, now an older, more tired zebra.\n\n"You are brooding, mother." Umalez voice came from behind Mekiouzza as she came up to stand by her mother's side. "You know that you do not need to do this, right? You can retire now, and let me deal with Tobuck. Perhaps the time has come for a younger and more vigorous zebra to take charge? Then you can stay in Agzhat and eat dates. Perhaps it would be a more fitting challenge for you."\n\n"Girl, I will have you caned." Mekiouzza gave her daughter a freezing glare. "I thought I would have peace when your father passed, but his barbed tongue has jumped into your mouth."\n\n"No rest for the wicked, mother, and there is not a greater villain in Zarantia than you." Umalez smile reached from ear to ear.\n\n"That's it, where can I find a cane?" Mekiouzza started looking around herself. She was certain she had seen some reeds she could use somewhere.\n\n"Oh but mother, if you need support to walk I can have one made for you!" Umalez laughed as she fled her mother's wrath."
 zarantia.1.a:0 "I am not dead yet, you insolent whelp!"
 
 zarantia.2.t:0 "The Lost City"
 zarantia.2.d:0 "Menes Amasdag - a trader from Tobuck - had arrived early that morning, and he carried with him news from Tobuck. Said news were enough to make the blood boil, yet Mekiouzza sat calmly on her pew as Menes spoke of Pea Shooter's plans.\n\n"And they say Equestria is the land of friendship," she sighed when Menes was done. "Is there no depth to which he won't sink? Not enough that he squats in our city, he even has the temerity to try to negotiate?"\n\n"It seems that way, your majesty. He asks for one year, and says that at the end of the year the city 'will be given back to you' as he put it... and though he is impudent, I humbly request that the crown repays his diplomacy in kind. Tobuck, much like your tribes, was devastated by the storm king, and though the ponies long for your return, sparing them more violence is the right thing to do."\n\n"A thief has crawled into your house and taken possession of it. Do you drive him out, or sit outside your house to patiently wait for when he deigns to leave?" Mekiouzza responded, Menes bowing his head in response.\n\n"I simply fear that threats, however justified, will only impact what little trade that still can flow to the city. Whatever you choose, though, know that the ponies of Tobuck still long for your return."" 
 zarantia.2.a:0 "Pea Shooter is a rat, and he shall be aware of where he stands."
 zarantia.2.b:0 "It is humiliating, but we can ill afford pride."
 
 zarantia.3.t:0 "From the Chaos, Growth"
 zarantia.3.d:0 "As you reach the highlands of northern Zarantia, the desert slowly gives way to rolling grasslands, which in turn become hills criss-crossed by small brooks. These lands are as fertile as you will find anywhere in Zarantia, and the valleys are filled with olive groves, fields of sorghum and cassava and even vineyards. Cool winds blow in from the north, contesting the hot, dry Zebhara, and gives the region periods of refreshing cool.\n\nHere, nested on the slopes of a large ridge, lies the city of Agzhat. It is a modest place by international standards, with buildings out of mud bricks and rammed earth. The buildings are - unlike the Zonician cities of the coast - built for defense as much as anything else, with many of them almost akin to small fortresses. Yet it is also a place of rapid change. Before the storm king, Colthaginian and Maregyptian investors had both seen the potential in this city, and industries have sprung up in the region. Foreigners are a more common sight than ever before as it escaped destruction and has became one of the few places still fully intact, and thus the best place to do business. The merchants and craftsponies that fled Tobuck and Pea Shooter's reign have settled among the Zarantians as well, doing their part in helping to raise the city up.\n\nThough the last years have been hard on the Aguellid and on Zarantia, for Agzhat, they have been good."

 zarantia.4.d:0 ""Why did we take Tobuck, my daughter?" Mekiouzza asked Umalez before taking a sip of her tea. "Not 'when', or 'under what pretext', but why?"\n\n"Because it was our gateway to modernity. Holding Tobuck would let our people rise to become akin to Colthage, or Maregypt."\n\n"Yes, we would seize a modern city, leave our old ways behind and become like the zonicians, with no trouble. That was why we failed. Yes, failed. Our people are bound by traditions millennia in the making. The future is like the Emerald Sea, vast, inviting, and we galloped out of the desert towards it when we took Tobuck... but the sea can drown you. You can become lost in it, and it is no less deadly than the Zebhara. If we do not have ourselves, then what do we have?"\n\n"And losing our old ways to start playing at being zonicians would make us what? Imposters, dancing to a foreign tune not ours?" Umalez nodded as she noticed mother's point. "But at the same time, that unwillingness to change is what lost us Tobuck."\n\n"Was it?" Mekiouzza asked pointedly. "Or was it blind faith that progress would be inevitable, and that my people had to lose themselves in order to be safe? Or..." she smiled wryly. "Maybe that is just simple fear speaking? It's so easy to flee and refuse to give up anything, and then you've already lost. Clinging to what drags you down can drown you even in shallower seas. It is a difficult issue, but that is why we are here, my daughter...""

 zarantia.5.d:0 ""At times, I do envy the rulers of other nations." Umalez murmured as more tea was poured for her. "Their people might bicker and fight for dominance, but they are still part of the same nation. Being the Aguellid of Zarantia seems to be more akin to herding dragons."\n\n"It is," Mekiouzza responded flatly. "Zarantia is not something written into the fabric of the land. It is an agreement between tribes, and if they feel that the deal is not honored, they will no longer stick around. The question is what the remedy will be."\n\n"In Griffonia, the griffons' empire was brought together through force, and all I've read says that the empire had no shortage of prideful or stubborn peoples. Then again... their empire's a shadow of what it was, and their leader frail."\n\n"Indeed, and yet at least they reached that far. That is more than you can say for many nations. Tribes like ours have worked together in concord, but conquest is how kingdoms have been built."\n\n"And yet aren't these kingdoms rocked by demands for democracy?" Umalez mused. "A hoofful of dragons will defeat an army of sheep. It's true that a cowed people follows more easily, but might not a nation of free zebras be even stronger?"\n\n"High-faluting ideals are dangerous, my daughter...""

 zarantia.6.d:0 ""The zonicians are an amusing sort." Mekiouzza said out of the blue. "We have been their neighbours for untold centuries, and yet so many of them think we do not live in towns or villages at all. I recall this one playwright in Colthage who wrote a play where an Imazeeb mare was withering away because she was 'trapped' in the city. I had the misfortune to watch it once when visiting, and I did not know if I was to collapse in laughter, or retrieve a cane and go find the playwright."\n\n"It is so strange. Agzhat lies close to their lands, do they not know how many of us have been settled for centuries?"\n\n"I guess they do not consider those proper Imazeeb. In their mind, you must be nomadic to be a true Imazeeb. Yet... when you consider the opposition between the nomads and the settled, I suppose I see where they get confused."\n\n"How do you manage it?" Umalez asked her mother. "How do you find a balance between the settled and the nomadic?"\n\n"I don't, not really." Mekiouzza said. "Their needs are nigh completely opposed, and perfect balance is a precarious position. To favour none is to be able to trust none, and you need to find those who stand by you utterly. As for me...""

Aren't we sworn to aid her? Would she be a threat to us?"\n\n"A greater threat than most zebras you will meet, but not in battle." Wasif smiled at the naive remark. "She is a snake, coiling herself around you, and before you know it, her venom has made you content with being in her clutches. For how could you say no? I remember at one gathering, where she met with Zawgha Amsarmud. You would have thought they would be cold with each other, but Mekiouzza met her with the warmth you give a daughter, inquired about Zawgha's niece and whether she had had her foal yet. Within weeks, she was like a mother to all in their tribe."\n\n"I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? She's hospitable."\n\n"She ingratiated herself with the Amsarmud like she was everyone's mother, and before long they were so woven into her schemes that they could not pull away without ripping themselves apart. Now they walk by her side, so integrated into the greater Ataghan that they are no longer a whole, but part of something else. That's why she's dangerous. She sees no Talat, or Amsarmud, or Ataghan. All she sees is Imazeeb, and as long as she is Aguellid, she will defend and care for them.""

Wiwurgh Tasawent was a slight Zebra, though just how was hard to see thanks to the Tasawent's customary blue robe and veil that covered all but his bespectacled eyes. Yet, his age and his wisdom shone through his obscuring clothes as he placed the books down before Mekiouzza and accepted the tea.\n\n "My life's work, such as it is. Alas, I return before you a defeated Zebra." He bowed his head before drinking. Mekiouzza, whose hoof had travelled over the first book's cover, raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I count eight books, each of them sizeable. Can there be so much in the art of alchemy you still have not learned?"\n\n"For each and everything I learned, I realized there were ten things more to discover." Wiwurgh sighed as he gave the cup back. "My life's goal, I am afraid, was a far to ambitious one for one single zebra to master. The world is great, greater than we realize, and when we rise to challenge it, it reminds us of how small we are. You saw that a long time ago, did you not? That was why you have sought to unite our people, and elevate us to something different?" Mekiouzza did not answer, only smiled wryly at him as she raised the cup to him and drank.

Tens of thousands of zebras from hundreds of tribes are pouring into the city, each tribe a colourful parade of wealth and power. Yet the mood is not tense, but hopeful. Foals stand on the rooftops, raining down flower petals over the arriving tribes as music and song fills the air, and as the chieftains arrive at the Aguellid's castle, they are welcomed like kin by her. Food, drink, even the singuler gift of a cup of Igennet tea awaited them, with no expenses spared.\n\nSome came ready for arguments, straining against the Aguellid's overreach, but they found themselves embraced and led to a sumptious feast before they could say much. Others, who had hoped to converse in private with the Aguellid to curry favour were gently but firmly kept among their peers. Outside the castle, the tribeszebras who came with their chieftains are treated to feasts as well. Every household and every family of the Ataghan have opened their homes and tents, and from the highest to the lowest, all in Agzhat hosts their kin tonight."

Years have passed, friends were lost and gained, enough scars were cast on her body to make her look like a battleground map, and those naive, fresh eyes were replaced with a steely, temperate gaze.\n\nAlongside her as she looked backwards is the Ironbreaker Warriors, her battle brothers and sisters from home and abroad. Many of those she left with would never return home, their belongings and sometimes ashes being carried in a simple wagon to the families that even after all this years, waited either their return or a closure. Alongside these fallen brothers however, were many faces fresh from her home, folk that she extended a hoof in friendship and family, when the world had all but cast them down.\n\nThe Ironbreaker Warriors are not the same group that left this village that day. Bonds carved in battle, Ponies and even Gryphons stand alongside her ranks, each one carrying their particular wisdom and experience on each of their motions.\n\nZawgha is not the same.

For centuries, the Zebhara has been the fastest route to cross the continent, but there are few who have been able to brave the sand ocean. The Imazeeb are among those who have the strength, the skill and the willpower to conquer this desolate region, and from Maregypt to Colthage, merchants have eagerly hired their services to help speed them along their way.\n\nIn the wake of the Storm King's rampage, the caravans that once trekked these dangerous routes have all but disappeared, yet the flow of and desire for commerce has not abated, and there are those who long for the routes to open again. Tobuck might currently be lost to us, but our services are still desired across Zebrica, and we are still here to provide." #Zarantia used to be an important route for the trans-zebharan trade, and though it was kinda in shambles after the storm king, it's time to get it going again.

Thankfully, our guards could smooth things over, and our merchants could deal in their goods along the route.\n\nThe lands we travelled are still dealing with the aftermath of the Storm King's invasions, and the still devastated towns and villages we saw make it all too clear that it will take months, if not years, to restore them. Yet, life goes on, and there is still the need for trade.\n\nMaybe the goods needed are more practical than they used to be, but the buyers are no less interested.

 zarantia.13.d:0 "The Zonicians believe that we love the desert. We don't. We endure the desert, but we do not love it. There is nothing in the desert and no zebra needs nothing. We love the rivers that briefly flows through our lands in the winter. We love the times that the rain brings the desert alive with countless flowers and plants, we love the fields that bring plentiful harvests of sweet fruits and filling grains. We love the sacred Igennet flowers that the mighty Ijirmed leaves in its wake, and we tend every little patch we find like it was our children.\n\nThe Zonicians have lived so long along their verdant coastlines, where the soil provides all that they could dream of, that when they see us eking out a living in the Zebhara, they presume it must be a matter of desire rather than necessity. As we carve the wadis and the dried riverbeds into canals and reservoirs, treasuring every drop we are given, we remember Tobuck, that city between the rivers. There, the coastline was ours, and the ponies we liberated from their Warzenan oppressors were our friends. We traded, we feasted together, found love with each other and worked together to build a future together.\n\nTobuck might be lost to us, at least for now, but as we wait to regain that city, we wait, and we carve the desert to give what little it can." #Zarantia might be born in the desert, but they don't really like it.

Mekiouzza has seen first hoof the broken families, the destroyed cities and abandoned tents, the scorched lands of her people, and their despair gripped her heart. The horrors he inflicted on her people were an unforgivable crime, and if she were any lesser, she would have fallen in a deep despair, or a maddened sense of revenge.\n\nNot to say she didn't desire revenge, but this revenge wouldn't come from blood and fire, but by picking up the pieces left from her home, and reforge into something greater, a whole larger than the Storm King ever saw before it blighted them with their presence.\n\n"As you can see, my Queen the rebuilding of Shizra is going apace." An assistant shows her ledger after ledger, as well as reports. "...at the pace of everything, reconstruction should be done within the month."\n\n"Not only reconstruction. Improvement." She said, to the light confusion of the assistant. "Shizra didn't have schools to teach it's youth. It didn't have a pier so it's people could take from the bounty of the rivers effectively." She continued, pushing herself to stand from her chair, gazing upon the window with a thoughtful, stern expression. "It didn't have plowshares and shoves, to work it's riverbed soil into the nature's bounty. I trust those means were all given to them now?"\n\n"Yes, my Queen."\n\n"Good. You're dismissed."

None would dare accuse her after all, and yet, as they argued, it was clear amongst them the different interpretations of the oath; veterans and newly-picked representatives of the tribes argued amongst themselves on what they meant, and soon a dawning realization came to them, prompted by a single question.\n\nMekiouzza raised a single hoof, silencing the commotion, before she spoke again.\n\n"I do not doubt the commitment of the tribes to the promise, but how long has it been since those oaths were carved in words and paper? How many were here, so long ago, when they were made? I do not ask for a test of faith, but a renewal of those promises. An oath made, for a new age."\n\nShe gesticulates a hoof over all the leaders, a careful laid smile on her expression.\n\n"Look at our land, our people. How they've suffered, yet how they've grown.

Her heart fluttered with  pride as once again her people had reclaimed her birth home to the world.\n\nAnd the world laid out there, ready to know her name. Ripe for Zarantia to one day stand as high as their peers of Colthage and Maregypt. And, if she allowed herself a moment of arrogance, to know the name of Queen Umalez.\n\nTobuck was returned to Zarantia and even with all the problems and challenges to come, Umalez let herself dream of possibilities that were yet to come, which didn't help her see the lightpost in front of her, her daydreams interrupted by the reality that she was not intangible."

Honor was nothing: convenience overruled it again and again, and the bonds forged through it withered under the sun.\n\nAll that mattered in the end was power, and power came from unity. Bickering would break that unity apart, and destruction would follow. It was a simple and yet cruel equation, proven beyond any reasonable doubt by the events of the last years.

She made her engineers carve the arena from stone, imported radios and recording equipment, and sent and scattered them across Zarantia, together with her challenge!\n\nThe people of Zarantia would be witness to the question that they didn't dare voice in front of her: Is her people, her government, truly a better path than what they had stubbornly clung to, all this time?\n\nThe battle took the good part of an hour, witnesses clinging to their seats, and she was sure families and entire clans sat around their radios, captivated by one of her aide's surprising ability at narrating the bout! Wasif fought like a Zebra possessed, but he only knew how to fight Zarantians. Zawgha was a warrior forged by coin, and battles abroad, and little by little, she wore him down until a brutal pommel strike to his cheek sent him crashing into the sand as the crowd roared and clopped.\n\nThe next day, with the city of Agzhat as witnessed on that same arena, they saw the most vicious warrior of the country bend his head and kissing her hooves, submitting himself and his tribe to her service, until the end of times."

And in a way, he still was, just not in the way his ancestors would have neither liked nor approved of.\n\nSimply put, he was a banker of the National Bank of Zarantia in Agzhat; which wouldn't be so "bad", if he wasn't also working closely with the Aguellid as she smothered the other tribes. Her plan was simple: outlast the tribes that refused a place in the council but and to submit to their taxation or any measure of control of their work.\n\nThat was what he was here for, after all. His time as a caravan gave him the mindset of one, and he knew how to starve them: simply fund the tribes and caravans that were more willing to play nice with them. A merchant, after all, was loyal to coin more than their tribesmen if they desired to make a profit, and by stealing the best caravaneers it would not only be the most stubborn merchants that would bend over, but also their business.\n\nThey would either submit to the government, and receive aid and investment, or break, sell out, and he would be there to buy them and put it to better use. And as the clock rang lunchtime, he stopped writing the missive of acquisition from his own tribe's rivals cotton farms and left his office towards the quaint, novel restaurant across the street. Maybe he could meet Addae, he'd been dying to ask her out on a date."

And at the centre of it all stood the Aguellid and her daughter, mediating and subtly inserting their desired topics to the discussions, which tended to be accepted nonetheless.\n\nWithout any fanfare, over days and weeks, the concept of Zarantia as a true, federalized nation, became more and more of a reality. It would have almost filled her with pride if it wasn't for the fact that the time-honored tradition of throwing their horseshoes at each other when discussions became particularly heated had gone nowhere..."

She responded, fairly dryly, and casually leaning her head back as she dodged a half-hearted attempt from her mother to clobber her in the head.\n\n"Your sarcasm notwithstanding, what you're seeing right now is an uncut diamond. A potential to be something greater than even Tobuck, if one would only polish it, and make it shine brighter."\n\n"Greater than Tobuck? You surely don't mean that?"\n\n"I don't make claims I can't back up, Umalez. One of my biggest mistakes was thinking that Tobuck could have held our weight to the world by itself, that prosperity was to be found at those lush lands...no. The desert holds a treasure that the Imzeeb have neglected for far....far too long."\n\nShe tapped her cane on the ground and looked at her daughter once again...instead of the stern, harsh expression that she had seemed to permanently wear for the good part of a year, there was only a kind, soft expression as she spoke candidly, from mother to daughter.\n\n"I want you to look at this, and I'll promise you, the next time you cross this street""

Their knowledge of metallurgy and its industrial tycoons could easily be the push her country needed.\n\nOn the other hoof, Maregypt's trading history is downright millenary, and its development in recent years has been by leaps, thanks to their investment towards the new technologies; a future that she desires to lead her nation herself.\n\nHowever, she can't play both sides, a mixed capital is mixed trouble.

It was a grand menagerie of workers indeed, from captured slaves from other nations, foreign advisors and experts and various tribal labourers all working side by side.\n\nThrough day and night, through careful guidance from experienced travelers and their generational knowledge as well as foreign expertise, they carved a path through the desert, one built the test of dunes and winds, all the way out to the seas at Menzaka.\n\nAnd when they reached the sea, a sight of boundless blue that seemed impossible for many of them, they could not help but feel pride in their work. Even if nobody would know who they were, the road would outlast them. And one day, when those same foreign machines on wheels, boats, traders, and tourists came within their lands, their legacy would forever be enshrined on the path they walked upon.

In a few moments, a radio would broadcast her speech across all radios on her country, and what better way to make the first, of hopefully many broadcasts, than severing one of her country's oldest crutches.\n\n"People of Zarantia. Tribes, Imazeebs, Ponies and all. When Tobuck was stolen from us, I've thought deeply of our future, our country's future! What kind of proud nation, proud queen, would have built a strong legacy to simply collapse by itself when we lost but a city! But a territory!"\n\n"I've decided that before my body returns to the desert and my soul wanders the endless winds, I would set upon the stone to which a nation, not a group of collected tribes, but one, an individual home we share under the sky, would stood and grow! Growing pains have certainly been felt, and many detractors endeavored to stay against these changes, but still we are undeterred. Still we are stronger!"\n\n"Yet, one topic, many wish I wouldn't topic. One that, no matter how neutral the tribe stood, still dabbled on it. To put the chains on the defeated, the prisoners, the spoils of conflict. You might be glaring, you might be shutting off these radios, but I speak of a plain truth...it has no future in the Zantara of tomorrow. To hold one in chains is to consign them to a fate not of their control, neither to their freedom, and isn't freedom one of our main values?!"\n\nAnd, on the memory of every clansperson, on every slave owner who hurriedly shut down that lasted device, and carved in the heart of every soul clad in metaphorical and literal chains, were the next words..."

Murder to her wrists? Doubly so!\n\nHer maid, Adowa, raised alongside her took the quill, staring at it for a long moment, her expression conflicted.\n\n"...Are you expelling me, Ummy? Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"W-what, no! You're a free mare! Your family has been our slaves since the times my mother had my age, don't you want to be free?"\n\n"...W-where would I even go?"\n\nShe stared at her lady, her friend, her wide, nervous eyes glancing at the zebra she grew alongside with. Of course, many of these slaves were from generations, where else would they go? She remembered something Mother did for those...what was it?\n\nAs if a lightbulb lit over her head, she quickly pulled a blank small quill, writing the terms of a quick contract, before hooving it to her, and motioning her to read. She seemed confused for a moment, her expression melting into peace as she read more and more.\n\n"I hereby declare Adowa Nefertiti to be the Princess Umalez of Zarantia's personal bedmaid, until she no longer deems herself worthy of service, upon the word of the Aguellid.""

The silence was near deafening, but neither of them seemed willing to make the first move. It was a mood that could so easily explode into violence, and though they were both hard-bitten tribes more than willing to shed blood for honor's sake, that same honor forbade them from making the first move. Also...\n\n"Thank you all for your presence today. I'm overjoyed to see that you take your children's first day so seriously." The teacher of this new "school" said with a smile from where he stood at the other end of the classroom, and both chiefs turned to glare at this Agzhat interloper as their children had found their places in the rows of benches. "My name is Naravaz Tifirrelest. You can address me as Mister Tifirrelest, or for you children, you can simply say teacher. And today I especially wish to welcome Chief Munatas Aqyun and Chief Zararni Amcic: it is an honor to meet you both."\n\n"As chief of the Aqyun/Amcic, I-" the two chiefs both began before stopping and giving each other withering glares as the mood in the room dropped even further. Neither of them continued saying what they were going to say. Their followers all rose up a bit taller, glaring down their respective counterparts, and the children cowered a bit in their seats. Mister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, continued to smile even if it was an ever so slightly forced smile. Gods and ancestors both help him, if these were the tribes his students came from..."

 zarantia.33.d:0 ""So tell me, you two." Mister Tifirrelest said as he watched the two young zebras standing in front of him. Zadla Aqyun and Takama Amcic had been at each other's throats since the very first day, and now they had come to actual blows, with Zadla missing a tuft of mane and Takama having a bite mark on her leg. "Why did this start? Nonononono!" he said, raising his hoof as they seemed about to start yelling at the same time. "Zadla will go first, and then Takama will speak."\n\n"Takama pushed my cousin!" Zadla said, Takama bristling.\n\n"I pushed him because he wouldn't leave my sister alone!" she yelled out angrily.\n\n"You lie, just like Amcic always..." Zadla began and Mister Tifirrelest slammed his hoof into the table.\n\n"QUIET!" Mister Tifirrelest roared, cowing them both before leaning down to begin untangling this entire mess. So Zadla's cousin had been pushed, but that was only because he had harassed Takama's sister after she had tricked him out of his lunch and she had done that because another kid had stolen hers and gods help them all... "So what started all this?" he asked the two. "Go back to the very start of this whole thing. Where did this conflict begin between your two groups?" He looked from Zadla to Takama, neither of them answering. Narawaz sighed.\n\n"This started centuries ago. At some point, Amcic and Aqyun started fighting, and you've been fighting ever since. Nobody knows where it started, because it is a braid made from spite and anger that goes back since before anyone was born." he placed a hoof on each of their shoulders. "I understand why you did what you did, both of you, but I am here because the Aguellid needs more from you. On her behalf, I ask that there be peace between your two tribes.""

 zarantia.34.t:0 "Silly Games" 
 zarantia.34.d:0 "The mood was really awkward in the school bench. Mister Tifirrelest had reshuffled their seats, and Takama and Zadla had gotten the dubious pleasure of sitting side by side. Neither of them had said anything to the other for the entire day. In fact, they hadn't even looked at each other, and instead focused on their work. And yet still the air was almost quivering between them, and as Zadla reached out to grab her pen she accidentally bumped into Takama, who gave her a sour glare. Zadla glared back only for both of the girls to jump in their seats when Mister Tifirrelest slapped their bench with his cane.\n\n"Did you intentionally push her, Zadla?" he asked and Zadla looked down at her bench.\n\n"No, it was an accident," she muttered, and Mister Tifirrelest looked to Takama, who also looked down. Turning around, he returned to the blackboard. Zadla, meanwhile, glanced at Takama and stuck out her tongue before quickly turning back to look at the blackboard when Takama glared at her. After a few seconds she realized Takama was doing something and looked, only to see Takama turn back towards the teacher as well. Realizing what she was doing, Zadla extended her tongue once more and turned back before she was spotted, unable to stop a small smile from creeping onto her face as their silly game continued.\n\nMister Tifirrelest, meanwhile, heard the small giggles coming from behind him after a while and smiled to himself before schooling his face. Though he approved, he still had a class to hold."

 zarantia.35.t:0 "Sometimes, Victory isn't All" 
 zarantia.35.d:0 "Zadla didn't like tests. It wasn't the test itself that was the issue though, it was that both tribes turned up to hear the results. Her father and a large contingent of the Aqyun tribe had gathered outside the school building, once again staring down the Amcic across the schoolyard. It felt weird, like two different parts of her life that wasn't meant to come together, and she gave Takama an apologetic look. She'd never tell her father, but she didn't mind Takama. After today though... she had felt confident on the test, and she knew she had a chance to get the top score. But if she was the best in her class, her father would lord it over the Amcic, and by that Takama. As they stood there, waiting, Zadla realized she was begging that she didn't get the top score. She didn't really care about that, not if it cost her her... friend?\n\nAs Mister Tifirrelest came outside, over a hundred eyes turned to him as he cleared his throat to call for the students, who lined up to receive their tests from him. Zadla realized her heart was beating, and she could only bow mutely as she was given her results. Walking over to her parents, she looked down at the score... 98/100.\n\n"98! Well done, my daughter!" Her father said loudly, patting her shoulder. "I knew you could do it! You've made me and the tribe both proud today!" Zadla wanted to sink down into the ground as she saw her father preen in the diretion of Takama's, who only blinked.\n\n"Wait a minute... my daughter also got 98! Has your brat been copying her?!" Takama's dad yelled. The two girls, meanwhile, looked at each other in surprise, and as their fathers began to yell at each other about who had copied from who, the girls snuck away to exchange tests. Realizing that they really had gotten the same results, they high-fived in joy."

Taking a temporary leave, and alleviating the worries of her aids she left her tent to take a long walk amidst the dunes of her home.\n\nThe howling of the wind, the biting cold, the starry sky, and the milky way stretched across her vision, reminding her how little time she truly had left. Her sun had set a long time ago, and she could do was to make sure the desert, its treasure, her people, and her daughter, endured the time the winds called to her yet again.\n\n"Mother, are you alright?"\n\nUmalez came running, a bit breathless. Such a teasing brat, yet it's moments like these her heart shone true...would she be okay? Would she be okay without her, eventually? She doesn't know...she likely never will.

She didn't care much for the politics that happen between the tribe, her tribe casting her out in the desert for the crime of falling in love taught her a sharp lesson in trust not the whimsical, frail link between Imzabeeb, but between individuals, and bonds of kinhood.\n\nThat being said, that was one of the few decisions of the Aguellid she fully endorsed, and she all but insisted to see it to fruition. And as she stepped upon the fields of the tribe, and she saw the malnourished, weakly "spoils of war", she simply unsheathed her sword and trotted to each one with an unreadable expression.\n\nIt is depressing to think that as she approached, a tinge of fear came over them as if they were guilty of anything. She rose her saber high, and struck each and every one of their chains, their faces brightening as they were cast free.\n\n"You are a free zebra of your own accord. My brothers will take you towards the nearest town, and aid you in finding a true path to yourself."\n\nOf course, she knows it's not all in the goodness of her Aguellid's heart. The furnaces and factories need hooves to train, and the "economy" she so hears about needs people to buy, and be paid. But, in that particular instance, to the tearful smiles, hugs, and even oaths of following her Warband, she can't help but remark on how far that naive zebra cast to the desert went."

How will our tribe carry on without your knowledge or skill? This service will assure none of them are forgotten to time. After all, I would not have accepted her if I hadn’t absolute confidence in your abilities as a blacksmith."\n\nZudad paused for a moment, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Then, he shook his head with a scoff. "Perhaps I could make an exception this time, even if she’s an Aqyun." His hard eyes settled on the young mare, the wrinkles on his face deepening with a frown and causing her to flinch back. "You sleep in the room in the back.

As an assistant, Zadla had quite the number of tasks to take care of, like preparing the furnace’s lumps of coal for work, sweeping the floor, and cleaning up the working surfaces once the day ended. Still, there was at least a silver lining. She liked to observe Master Zudad while he was at work. Furthermore, the older zebra loved to talk as he busied himself near the furnace; mostly to complain about Maregyptians keeping all the good metal for themselves, or to go into deep detail on various metallurgic techniques Zadla had never heard of.\n\nNot today. Zudad had remained silent, his eyes focused on the ingot of steel before him. Sparks flew with each strike of the hammer, stopping only momentarily as to gauge at his work, only to then begin again, in silence. He finally stopped after several hours, as the sun had already slipped beneath the horizon, and only after Zadla had pointed out the fact to him.\n\n"Do you know what this is, kid?" Zudad said as he removed his working googles. Zadla shot a puzzled glance at the object laying of the working surface. "Well, that’s a piece of metal, right?"\n\n"A piece of metal?!" Zudad scowled. "Kid, if I didn’t think you had some potential, I would have caned you already. A good blacksmith never sees the raw material, but always has the finished work before his eyes." Zadla gave a sceptical glance at the bar of steel in question but nodded anyway. "Oh. I see."\n\n"No, you don’t. And I guess that’s the real problem here. It’s a waste of breath describing it with words alone." Zudad shook his head. "No matter. You’ll see it tomorrow with your own eyes. Clean up now while I prepare dinner."\n\nZadla nodded and set out to work, before stopping midway as something finally clicked in her mind. "Wait. Master Zudad, did you say that I have potential?"

"One can’t just say no to his own chief, after all. And besides, it might be a good thing that I’m accompanying him. Munatas has this fascination with any kind of foreign machinery.

You’ve watched over my workshop before, right?"\n\nZadla hesitated, then shook her head. "For two weeks at most, not months. Master Zudad, I don’t think I’m ready for this. What if I mess something up while you’re ..."\n\n"Oh, give me a break, kid!" Zudad suddenly snapped. "Don’t come here telling me you’re afraid of working alone.

Pockets of resistance and reports of Guerrilla ambushes are still fairly common, she still has a nation to build before her daughter takes the Crown, and the threat of their neighbors is an ever subtle, insidious whisper in her ears; the path will be long, arduous, and she will certainly not live to see the end of it, whatever destiny it may take.\n\nBut, if those quick bright flashes are any indication, Zarantia may be starting to appear on the newspapers abroad it seems.

He allowed them to surrender and to a faint shame of his part they've surrendered to the sieging forces almost immediately. He wondered if any of them bothered to understand why he held so tightly to Tobuck, to the ideal of this fake, artificial state. The population despised them, their armies were as loyal as the coin was plentiful, and in truth, no single politician of the republic thought of their nation as anything more than a squeeze and dump investment.\n\nTruth is, he didn't know either. Perhaps he was a fool, perhaps he was a griffin tired of running from his past, and desired a fresh start somewhere far from a place that knew his name, his true name.\n\nHe picked a bottle of Gryphonnian Whiskey and poured himself a cup.

She could tell the zebras around her were surprised by her actions. Though he was a chieftain of high honor and status, he was still a Buckharan, and the Imazeeb's relation to their very distant cousins in the east had always been a wary one.\n\n"Your hospitality is peerless, noble Aguellid, and I'm honored to sit in your house - a house equal in honor and dignity to your nation." He gave the bowl back to her with his head bowed. The Buckharans had not weathered the last years much better than the imazeeb had, but unlike the imazeeb, the Buckharans had not managed to reassert themselves and instead were trapped under the iron hoof of the Quaggatai and their Khan. Mekiouzza had made overtures to them many years ago, but they had politely rebuffed her back then. Of course, desperate times had a way of making old familial ties bubble to the surface.\n\n"It is a long overdue meeting, cousin, but I am happy to welcome you." Umalez smiled as she accepted the bowl from him and drank as well. It was a careful dance, one that likely would take days if customs would be observed. It would be, that was why the Buckharans were here. The Quaggatai overlordship chafed, and they had decided to take their chances with the Zarantians in the hopes that the Amsisi would give them their honor and independence back.\n\n"As am I, and if the gods will it, I hope we may see many future meetings like these. Of course, I would not expect a gift like this every time." He smiled slightly at her and Umalez returned it. As for her... the Buckharans were their distant relations, and controlling it would further strengthen their hold on the trans-zebrican trade.

Yet, it would not be an uncomplicated matter.

 zarantia.150.t:0 "The Hard Lessons of Leadership"
 zarantia.150.d:0 "The willful Imazeeb tribes had demanded the respect and independence they believed themselves due, and they had been ravaged until their spirit was broken. The criminals that had infested Tobuck had believed themselves secure from the wrath of its rightful owner, and they had been hunted down and killed to the last. Time and time again, as the world had crashed down on Zarantia, there had been one answer: force.\n\nIn the end, the world was a place where peoples and rulers scratched and clawed at each other, all to seize a place for themselves, and the instance you stopped fighting, you condemned yourself to death. Mercy and kindness were luxuries to be doled out in service of an end goal, and that goal was fear. Fear that you'd lose favour with your ruler, fear that the outsiders would come and take away what you had, fear that the world would hurt you if you did not hurt it first.\n\nStanding in front of Mekiouzza's mausoleum, Umalez wept. She wept for the passing of her beloved mother and for the cruelties that had come to pass under her watch. What more, she cried because she knew what would come next. No other chieftain remained to challenge the Ataghan tribe's dominance - her dominance - and the title of Aguellid-Queen was now hers by right... as would be the cruelty that holding this position would demand.\n\nThe lesson was taught, and Umalez had always been a good student. Liking or disliking the truth would not change. It was blood and death that had raised her to this position, and if she did not maintain the course, she would throw away all her mother had achieved. She wasn't that selfish, and she bowed her head to touch it against the cold stone door."

The hundreds of gathered warriors finished their oath, and Umalez rose up from the throne she had been sitting in. Stepping forth to stand side by side with Zawgha, who had administrered the oath, she addressed them for the first time.\n\n"Soldiers, you now stand as the true defenders of the throne and the nation. You have risen above the petty bickering of old, and you serve a higher purpose: to shield this nation from enemies both internal and external. By your labours, Zarantia will prevail, now and forever!"\n\n"Now and forever!" Their cry was almost deafening, and Umalez smiled as they saluted her.

Step down and bow your head because if you don't, the price is way higher than you can pay."\n\n"I didn't think the Ironbreaker would be the one who broke so easily," the chieftain across the table from her said with a raised eyebrow. "The Ataghan girl is not her mother, and she must be reminded of this."\n\n"She knows that she's not," Zawgha locked eyes with the old stallion. "When her mother made an example of the Talat some of us learned to not cross her, but Umalez learned that only violence can keep her where she is. She's learned that lesson with all her heart, and believes in it with fanatical fervor. There is no line she won't cross, no cruelty she will will not stoop to. I know you are looking for concessions to remain loyal, but she will kill you, she'll kill your family, she'll hunt down those who would seek vengeance for them, and end your entire tribe down to the foal born yesterday. Not because she is arrogant enough to think herself untouchable, but because to her, her mother's actions proved that is the only way to ensure order. This is not politics to her, it's faith, and she will gladly sacrifice anything on that altar."\n\n"If she is mad dog, then she..." the old chieftain began and Zawgha sighed, slamming her cup down to cut him off.\n\n"I have given my warning. It is more than she will do. Do with it what you wish, but once you make her your enemy, you will never be anything else to her. That is the age in which we live now, and for your children's sake, learn the new rules.""

By word of the Aguellid-Queen, the tribes were no longer recognised legal entities in any form. Their privileges were revoked, their standing nullified and their customs no longer any more than quaint familial traditions.\n\nYet, the laws and its interpreters were controlled by the Aguellid-Queen, and silence reigned on the matter. The tribes that were in a position to challenge her or cause issues were long since cowed or bought off, leaving only the long since marginalised to cry out - fruitlessly - in protest.

Out there were a horde of predators, each hungry for power and success, and they tirelessly circled around her in the hopes of currying favour. They would look for any signs of weakness, and they would pounce on it instantly. Thus, from the moment that door opened, she would be nothing but an indomitable autocrat who controlled Zarantia and every living creature within it. Yet for now, she would enjoy the little freedom she could still enjoy.\n\nShe did not bemoan her fate, it was all for Zarantia. Her mother had founded it, she had completed it, and one day her daughter would be the one to carry it on. Fate, the gods, the natural progression of society, whatever the forces that had brought them here had demanded that the Imazeeb be cowed if they were to become one nation. Like so many rulers throughout history, she had led her people down the path to civilisation by forcing them down it. That was the role she had been given, and she would not shirk from it, even if it exhausted her.\n\nA knock on the door left her sitting up almost instinctively, and she turned impassively to watch the servant that entered, holding a tray with her breakfast. Stepping out of the bed to be dressed, she realized that she longed for the next morning and the few minutes of freedom she would have then."

zarantia_umalez_flavor.10.d:0 "It was strange how cruelty became easier over time. Like with most things, practice made perfect, and though Umalez still felt troubled by some of the things that were happening, she couldn't help but grow familiar with it. The tribes that had seemed so proud and headstrong turned out to be pliable if enough force was applied, and those who didn't bow were simply killed. It had gone against centuries of dearly held tradition, and Mekiouzza should have been killed by the tribes as they rose up. Yet, after decades of playing the game, Mekiouzza had known how to outplay and isolate all those who did not bow to her, and though thousands lay dead by her hoof, Zarantia was stronger for it.\n\nBut what was it all for, Umalez wondered. Her mother was unquestioned, and wielded power beyond what any Imazeeb ever had. Was this merely the natural culmination of her efforts? Was it the inevitable end result for someone who sought to change the world around them?\n\nShe would once have been disgusted by it, and claim that the Aguellid's role was to serve as the defender of the tribes, not to tower above them like some Maregyptians Pharaoh or Griffonian Emperor. Agreement and negotiation was their people's way, and though she knew that things would have to change, wasn't the goal to only reach as far as was needed to in order to ensure their people could still thrive? The once obvious answer, wasn't nearly as obvious any longer. "

zarantia_umalez_flavor.3.d:0 ""You are like an antlion sometimes, master Wiwurgh," Umalez told the sage as they wandered the roads of Agzhat. "When I least expect it, you pop out and toss your questions in my face like sand. Ijirmed itself could not keep a zebra on their guard like you do."\n\n"If the question caused offense, I am more than willing to withdraw it." Wiwurgh bowed his head and Umalez smiled dryly at him.\n\n"Oh but it's already in my head, isn't it? Wiggling around and just waiting for an answer." Though she was making light of it, the question he had asked was one she had thought a lot about herself. Even now, after everything had crumbled, her mother had patiently begun to gather the tribes around her with as soft a hoof as she had shown decades ago. Umalez knew how much it vexed her mother to have to restablish the power she had held for so many years, she just hadn't expected Wiwurgh to needle her about whether it vexed her too. Did it though? Umalez pondered the question for a good while before answering." 
zarantia_umalez_flavor.3.a:0 ""No. I admire mother's efforts, and hope I can be as patient one day.""

zarantia_umalez_flavor.5.d:0 ""You have another question in mind, master Wiwurgh, I can tell." Umalez said as she took a break from her work of documenting the legends of their people. With the events of the last years, Umalez had decided to aid her people in a more oblique way. The Imazeeb had always been storytellers, and yet if they were meant to be one nation, wouldn't it behoove them to have those stories gathered as well? In this, Wiwurgh had been invaluable, even if he tended to continue needling her with his questions.\n\n"What's the purpose of Zarantia? Is it a vehicle for the Aguellid's ambitions, or does it mean more than that?" Umalez didn't reply at first, only blinked at him. That was audacious, even for him. What was he getting at? "I hold no intent of going against your mother in any way," Wiwurgh preempted her follow-up question, "but it is an important question. I cannot think of many zebras that are truly enthusiastic about the idea of trading away their independence to be ruled over by someone not of their tribe, not even one as revered as your mother. With that in mind, how does Zarantia justify its existence?""

zarantia_umalez_flavor.7.d:0 "The hour of fate was close at hoof, Umalez could tell. The tribes were coming together again, and her mother's position was more secure than it ever had been before. It would not be long before they marched on Tobuck now, and Umalez wondered what would happen then.\n\nFor all the changes that had come over their people in recent years, a few principles stood as strong as they ever had before. Though tempered by the Aguellid's law and the Amsisi, revenge was still a core tenet among the Imazeeb. When your security and dignity rested on being able to fight back against those who'd cross you, vengeance became not a vice, but a virtue. What more, by the Aguellid's words and creed Tobuck was equal to any Imazeeb tribe.\n\nAnd so, with their cousins on the coast conquered and degraded by honorless criminals who had sought to strip it bare to enrich themselves, the insult was as complete as it could be, and the demand for justice was absolute. Tobuck suffered, and so should not the Imazeeb pour out of the desert like a storm, and slay every last of these fiends for what they had done to the Imazeeb's distant family? And yet... was that what Tobuck wanted? Were the Imazeeb overlords coming to extract venceance for a slight against them more than they sought to liberate Tobuck?"

zarantia_umalez_flavor.9.d:0 ""Was I naïve to think that our people's stories would be any less difficult to wrangle than the tribes themselves?" Umalez sighed, flopping back in her seat and staring up at the ceiling. Wiwurgh put down his pen and looked at her with an eyebrow raised. "That is now seventeen variants of the legend of the floating cities. Twelve of them just among the Azir tribes. When I try to find the common themes, I'm left with one thing, a floating city."\n\n"And sadly, each of those tribes would say that their tales are truthful." The Blue Sage was placid about the entire affair, though he gave her a sympathetic nod. "It has rarely been an issue before. After all, no Imazeeb would be so brazen as to question another tribe's legends."\n\n"And you will now ask me what my purpose with this endevour is," Umalez added dryly as she scooted up to a sitting position and Wiwurgh clucked happily in response. Looking down at the texts in front of her, she thought about all the high-minded ideals she had had when starting her work. One unified canon of stories to serve as a tentpole for Zarantia and bring them together, yet there were so many variations that she didn't know where to even start. In the end..."

zarantia_umalez_flavor.11.d:0 "The Aguellid's role was clearly defined and always had been: elected by the tribes for the purpose of negotiating disputes and ensuring the safety of the tribes. To this end, they could call the tribes to war. That was the entirety of it, and Mekiouzza had run roughshod over it for a long time. Her influence was not strange per se, but the way she had tied it to her title was. She was no mere Aguellid, hadn't been for years, and yet what would happen when she was gone?\n\nUmalez sat quietly in her study, watching the bustling city outside the window. The last years had been crazy, and there was already so much that never would be the same again. Would the office go back to what it was, or would it too be forever changed? It should be such a simple thing to consider, a glorious triumph of her mother, but for some reason it made her pensive. How much could a people change and still remain themselves? She had worked tirelessly to preserve the rituals, the stories and the mythology of her people, but if all else had changed, was there a point to preserving those things?"
zarantia_umalez_flavor.11.a:0 "You are without equal, mother. But I hope our people will never need a zebra like you again."

It seemed as though our efforts to divide the tribes had paid off, and with the hoofful of tribes that we could buy off on our side, we were safe, at least until last night.\n\nOut of nowhere, nearly every last of the tribals packed their stuff and left. The entire coast is being emptied of zebras, and in the cases where our border patrols tried to stop them, the tribals shot their way out. If we wanted to ensure that we didn't have to deal with the tribes again, that has certainly happened, but the circumstances are beyond suspicious."

zarantia_worm.2.t:0 "The Secret is Out"
zarantia_worm.2.d:0 "We had thought that the departure of the zebras would at least give us some peace, but instead, there's rioting across the city! Someone has spread word of what happened to the Aguellid out to the people, and now they are out in the streets, calling for Vasile's head.\n\nVasile meanwhile is furious, and as the police is breaking up the protestors, an internal investigation into just who leaked this information out there. The troops involved in that fiasco were dealt with and wouldn't be able to tell anyone, and nobody outside the inner circle of advisors knew about it. Yet they are still out there, and when Vasile gets his claws on them, they'll wish they never were born."

We aren't sure what exactly happened, but they were evidently caught, and the tribes took their time with them.\n\nThe entire scene that met our border patrols was beyond gruesome, with the scouts having been ritually killed and their bodies arranged in some strange pattern. One of the guards identified it as a stylised Tatzlwurm, which only raises even more questions. Whoever this person who revealed what actually happened is, they're working with the tribals. What more, they're currently running circles around us!"

The streets of Tobuck are still filled with rioters, we've no idea what's going on in the deeper parts of the country, our troops are being sabotaged and bombs have started going off at airports and railroad hubs. The perpetrators we've managed to corner have cut their throats rather than to be captured alive.\n\nThey have been ponies, zebras, a couple griffons even, and the only thing that they have in common is that their bodies are covered in weird tattoos that have been identified as being that of the Zarantian mortuary cult. For some reason, these grave tenders have gone insane and are causing all the damage they can. The question is why, and there's a sense that we won't like the answer."

They are the heralds of the goddess of death, and all that steps in their path is undone. You do not fight the Ijirmed, you flee. Even if you could bring such a beast down, it would not earn you honor but rather exile, for their passage brings the sacred Igennet flowers to the desert, through which those blessed with its taste can glimpse the gods. They are eternal, their wrath endless and their gifts priceless, and when they sing, the imazeeb know the world will end.\n\nSlowly swaying as it towered above the zebras, the titanic worm filled the air with its rumbling lament together with the priests that encircled it. Other priests walked among the gathered crowds, holding baskets into which the tribeszebras threw their jewelry and their adornments, stripping themselves down to merely their robes in the way of mourners but for one exception; they were all armed. As the last zebra discarded his necklace and his rings, the mighty worm reared up high, its three jaws slowly opening as it looked out over the crowds. Gasps of horror and disbelief came from them, along with cries of denial or realization. Yet it all was drowned out as the worm, against all they knew, spoke.\n\n"Behold your past, the false roads you walked, and behold where they led you." The voice was not one but a thousand, all speaking in accord as its breath washed over them, overwhelming them with the acrid, sweet smell of Igennet. "The mirage has faded, and as you see, you understand. Aguellid broken, hopes crushed, trust betrayed, future murdered, rotting and left to the sand. So kill, Imazeeb, walk the bloody path, and bury the false world that would undo you. Die, and die as yourselves. End the broken world, and may the ashes bear the fruits of the a new one.""

It tears you up by the roots and makes you march to foreign drums, makes everything you are an inconvenience and a superstition, unworthy of anything but scorn.\n\nHow many of our people died when we liberated that misbegotten tumour in the west from the Warzenans? How much blood did we spend on protecting those fat gold-mongers, and what good did it do our people? Our greatest leader lies dead, our sacred rituals are reduced to pageantry to pacify us, and the one who should lead us became a puppet controlled by the debased foreigners. This is "modernity", this is what "progress" means to the outsiders. It is the taste they give their honeyed words to mask the poison inside.\n\nWhat have we bled for? What did we fight so hard for? What was the point of any of this?! That we would become twisted from within and reduced to slaves?! Modernity is a plague of the mind, one that destroys a people from within and leaves them beholden to only gold and greed. It is a mirage leading you astray and thirsting to death, all so that the carrion feeders can pick at your bones!\n\nIt is a false promise, one that has taken enough from us, all so that the tumour can keep feeding on us.

 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense:0 "The Arsenal of Defense"
 ZAR_arsenal_of_defense_desc:0 "If Zarantia is to remain be safe, we must never stop continuing in our efforts to procure new weapons, nor can we ever presume that we are "done" with improving our military production capacity."


###Political Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_unity:0 "The Issue of Unity"
 ZAR_issue_of_unity_desc:0 "The loss of Tobuck is more than the loss of a city, it is an existential threat to Zarantia itself. If a gaggle of warlords and gun runners can run us out of the city, then what will stop any outside force from crushing our fledgling state for good? We must come together, or we will fall."
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza:0 "I am Mekiouzza"
 ZAR_i_am_mekiouzza_desc:0 "I brought the tribes together. I led the war to free Tobuck from Warzena's clutches. I forged Zarantia as a concept, and I maintained it. It is mine by right, as none of the other tribal leaders could even come close to accomplish what I accomplished. Zarantia is mine, and I will drown it in blood before I allow it to fall."
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together:0 "Bringing the Tribes Together"
 ZAR_bringing_the_tribes_together_desc:0 "Zarantia is - must be - one united force. The tribes can no longer claim independence from it, and they must be given their place in the order that now arises. Their place will be given willingly and generously, but they will take it, or else..."
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi:0 "Enforce the Amsisi"
 ZAR_enforce_the_amsisi_desc:0 "There are those who would not view those outside their tribe as kin, but as outsiders. They would show hospitality, but only as much as is needed, and they would make excuses when called to defend those who would come to their aid. There is a word for this: betrayal, and it is time to remind them of this."
 ZAR_remember_your_friends:0 "Remember Your Friends"
 ZAR_remember_your_friends_desc:0 "Some of our people have stood by the Aguellid's side since the beginning. They have shown more than just recognition of her ability and given her loyalty. Through thick and thin, they have stood by her side, and Mekiouzza has not forgotten this."
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths:0 "Demanding their Oaths"
 ZAR_taking_their_oaths_desc:0 "The time has come for the Aguellid's power to be based on more than honor and custom. Those who stand by her will swear oaths to serve her, no matter what order she gives. If they do not give it, they have no place under her."
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward the Loyal"
 ZAR_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "For the headstrong tribes of Zarantia, blind obedience is not a virtue, but a strange foreign notion. In order to ease their transit into the fold, there must be generous rewards for those who bow their heads to her."
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die:0 "We Unite or Die"
 ZAR_we_unite_or_die_desc:0 "The Imazeeb are weak. Once, we were strong, but this new age is not kind to our kind of people. Tobuck showed this, and desperate situations demand desperate measures. Options that once were abhorrent must be considered. The price if we fail is too high."
 ZAR_for_my_people:0 "For my People"
 ZAR_for_my_people_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's life has been one long struggle to bring the Imazeeb together, and to lead not just a tribe, but a people. Time and time again, the world has contested her, but time and time again she has pushed on. Calling on every favour she has, she will achieve her goals no matter the cost."
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us:0 "Crush those who Would Divide Us"
 ZAR_crush_those_who_would_divide_us_desc:0 "Leaders object to Mekiouzza's plans, and tribes turn away from her. With their actions, they threaten to undo all that the Aguellid has accomplished. Generous gifts have failed, threats fallen on deaf ears.\n\nSo be it, either they die, or Zarantia dies."
 ZAR_they_blinked_first:0 "They Blinked First"
 ZAR_they_blinked_first_desc:0 "The savagery and speed with which Mekiouzza turned on her people has shocked the other tribes, and though many would willingly fight, it has been made clear that any tribe that turned against her would not find battle, but a slaughter. In blood and fire, Zarantia stays united."
 ZAR_a_true_queen:0 "A True Queen"
 ZAR_a_true_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza's place is carved into the annals of legend. For the first time, the Imazeeb are truly united. It happened in blood and death, but they now stand as one people. Queen Mekiouzza now leads her nation and her people forward to the future, for no other Imazeeb was worthy."

 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes:0 "The Tribe of Tribes"
 ZAR_the_tribe_of_tribes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have always been a people of many tribes, but the question is whether that truly is a weakness. Certainly it precludes autocratic methods, but how many foreign thinkers have not written about the importance of checks and balances? We have that, always had it, and we simply need to refine it."
 ZAR_a_common_code:0 "A Common Code"
 ZAR_a_common_code_desc:0 "The tribes value their customs and traditions, and if unity is to be reached, these things must be respected. It will demand all the effort that we can muster, but the reward will be a Zarantia that the tribes feel invested in."
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus:0 "The Tribal Council"
 ZAR_tribal_council_focus_desc:0 "Mekiouzza has a long tradition of calling the tribal leaders to her to counsel her. Perhaps this institution should be made permanent, and give the tribal chiefs a formalised say in Zarantia's governance."
 ZAR_establish_high_courts:0 "Establishing High Courts"
 ZAR_establish_high_courts_desc:0 "Inter-tribal squabbles take up too much time and effort that would be better spent elsewhere. In order to relieve the burden this places on the government, we must create a pan-Zarantian justice system of neutral mediators that can speak with the Aguellid's authority."
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights:0 "The Code of Rights"
 ZAR_the_code_of_rights_desc:0 "There must never be any doubt in the minds of our people that we will respect their way of life. Our commitment to preserving the rights our people always have known shall be written into the very fabric of our nation, and if we fail in it then we will be held accountable."
 ZAR_selling_unity:0 "Selling Unity"
 ZAR_selling_unity_desc:0 ""Unity" is a strange ideal to most Imazeeb, and if we are to convince them to change their ways and embrace it, we must offer them a lot in return. If it succeeds, it will be the sale of the century, and Mekiouzza is no stranger to pulling off difficult deals." 
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises:0 "Making Deals and Promises"
 ZAR_making_deals_and_promises_desc:0 "It will not be one great agreement that brings Zarantia together, but rather hundreds of small purchases and thousands of promises of aid or reward, arbitration, gifts and carefully chosen words."
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes:0 "Pressure the Unwilling Tribes"
 ZAR_pressure_the_unwilling_tribes_desc:0 "Not all tribes are open to unity, and some - like the Talat and their proud leader Wasif - fiercely defend their independence. Yet the Talat are poor, and where brute force might fail, a slow, steady squeeze might do better."
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option:0 "The Best and Only Option"
 ZAR_the_best_and_only_option_desc:0 "Unity will bring peace and prosperity, it will ensure our people's continued existence and it will ennoble our people in the eyes of the rest of the world. It is a fantastic deal, and so it is understandable that we do not take no for an answer."
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense:0 "Oaths of Mutual Defense"
 ZAR_oaths_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "If anything threatens one tribe, it threatens them all. This has always been the case, so formalising it is not an idea foreign to the tribes. Of all the changes that will come, it is probably the least controversial one, and it will let us mobilise much faster if needed."
 ZAR_a_chosen_council:0 "A Chosen Council"
 ZAR_a_chosen_council_desc:0 "As many tribal leader are unwilling to sit by Mekiouzza's side, and would rather attend their own affairs, Mekiouzza has suggested that instead they will choose representatives to fulfil this role. With these chosen representatives at her side, Mekiouzza's control is complete, even if not absolute."

###Industrial tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_land:0 "The Issue of Land"  
 ZAR_issue_of_land_desc:0 "It is from the land that our riches are gathered and grown, and from where the people stem. It is such a shame that the land is either held by absentee lords or lies fallow with no owner. To begin the path to modernity, this must be fixed."
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck:0 "Our Own Tobuck"
 ZAR_our_own_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck was a crutch to our nation's economy, and overreliance on it will not be a mistake we will repeat. Through investment, internal and external, we will carve a new jewel within our land."
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes:0 "Settling Land Disputes"
 ZAR_settling_land_disputes_desc:0 "One problem with land are the ancient disputes over who owns which land, or if it is owned in the first place. The traditional ways of handling these issues have proven futile. Modern methods are needed to work these problems out."
 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors:0 "Colthaginian and Maregyptian Advisors"
 ZAR_colthaginian_and_maregyptian_advisors_desc:0 "Even if we do not have the know-how that we need to continue our march towards a modern society, other nations and their people have. Gold is a powerful motivator, and some can be swayed to apply the white heat of technology to Zarantia."
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless:0 "Land for the Landless"
 ZAR_land_for_the_landless_desc:0 "The final step of the land reform is to grant what land that is available to tenant farmers and those who do not stand to inherit land. A new land of smallholders and independent farmers, where it is not just a small class of lords that take all the profit."
 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth:0 "Finding the Desert's Wealth"
 ZAR_find_the_desert_wealth_desc:0 "Where some see desolate wastes, we see opportunity. Riches beyond our dreams lie beneath the sands, and they are waiting for those worthy to use them as they see fit. We will find them, and we will use it for the betterment of Zarantia."
 ZAR_schooling_for_all:0 "Schooling for All"
 ZAR_schooling_for_all_desc:0 "Everything is founded on thoughts and brains. Though our generation may have been able to lift itselves up from our own disadvantages, we should not neglect the next generation. Everyone will need to receive an education. Tomorrow's battles will be faced by minds, not muscles."
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains:0 "Hammers to Break their Chains"
 ZAR_hammers_to_break_chains_desc:0 "Slavery is not only a weight to our economical potential, but a historical debt towards out people, for it has no place for a Zarantia that desires to grow. What only remains is to discuss how we will abolish this rot to our society."
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road:0 "The Trans-Zarantian Road"
 ZAR_the_trans_zarantian_road_desc:0 "Everything needs a place to be. The hammer needs the nail, the fuel the engine. And roads are how it gets there. It is no good having the parts if they cannot come together. A road is sorely needed."
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck:0 "The Second Tobuck"
 ZAR_the_second_tobuck_desc:0 "Foreign investments, labor and trade flows through Agzhat's markets and factories like water, the rough diamond not only turned into a oasis, but as as one of the finest jewels of Mekiouzza's Crown. Our work to bring Zarantia to the modern age is far from over, but there's no shame in taking a moment to gaze upon our works."


 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert:0 "The Rules of the Desert"
 ZAR_rules_of_the_desert_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have lived in these lands for centuries through countless toils and hardships. Why should this time be any different? These traditions and customs have not steered the tribes wrong before and they will not this time. It must be ensured that they are enshrined in law to preserve and refine them."
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws:0 "Tribal Support Laws"
 ZAR_tribe_support_laws_desc:0 "The building block of Imazeeb society is the tribe. Before Zarantia and all else is the tribe. As such, laws must be enacted to ensure that the tribes can take care of themselves and take care of their own, even if it comes at the expense of the state as a whole."
 ZAR_division_of_labour:0 "The Division of Labour"
 ZAR_division_of_labour_desc:0 "While such a term like “division of labour” may seem out of place among the Imazeeb, it is not. All must do their part to ensure their community runs smoothly and all are provided for. By codifying existing traditions regarding labour, we can ensure small communities continue to operate smoothly."
 ZAR_everyzebras_right:0 "Everyzebra's Right"
 ZAR_everyzebras_right_desc:0 "All creatures yearn to be free, and zebras are no different. By putting zebras in chains, we violate that natural urge. On top of this, slave labour is proving inadequate for producing the complex machinery and tools used in modern methods. As such, slavery in its current form will be incrementally abolished and all slaves allowed to live (and more importantly work) as they please."
 ZAR_internal_trade:0 "Internal Trade"
 ZAR_internal_trade_desc:0 "While all the people may need is within our borders, it does not mean everyzebra can easily access them. By encouraging trade and caravans between villages and tribes, all will be able to benefit from our wealth and focus on the development of their own communities."
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops:0 "The Thousand Workshops"
 ZAR_the_thousand_workshops_desc:0 "We do not need the massive, towering and dirty factories of the citydwellers. Cottage industry can be just as effective and every household is its own factory producing whatever the tribes, and therefore we, need be it swords, rifles, horseshoes, or silverware."
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships:0 "National Apprenticeships"
 ZAR_national_apprenticeships_desc:0 "Apprenticeships and masters teaching new tradezebras is a fairly common method of expanding skilled labor here and elsewhere in the world. We can upscale this process to the national level by establish state-backed apprenticeship schemas for those seeking trades as well as ensure all our tradezebras are up to a good standard."
 ZAR_duty_to_aid:0 "A Duty to Aid"
 ZAR_duty_to_aid_desc:0 "While we may not have the extensive handouts and welfare of our urban neighbours, we are not heartless. Everyzebra falls on hard times once in a while, and it is the duty of everyzebra in the community to help lift them up. Likewise, we should show hospitality and generosity to strangers of our tribes. Let us turn no pony, zebra, or otherwise away if they are in need."
 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own:0 "The Confederacy Stands By Its Own"
 ZAR_the_confederacy_stands_by_its_own_desc:0 "While this may seem like a loose union, it is still a strong one within. In such a short time, the groundwork has been laid to ensure the Imazeeb tribes remain relevant and stronger than ever without abandoning our core values. With this alliance of tribes and families, we are sure to stand up to any challenge that may come to our homeland."

###Tobuck Conquest Tree###

 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck:0 "Drive out the Thieves"
 ZAR_issue_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The time has come to retake Tobuck. Pea Shooter might be gone, but his former allies still infest the city and they have made it clear they will not surrender it. So bet it then. Like we did fifty years ago, we will free Tobuck by force of arms and teach the thieves the price of crossing us."
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed:0 "Tobuck Reclaimed"
 ZAR_tobuck_reclaimed_desc:0 "In the end, the gun runners threats and boasts were nothing more than bluffs and empty banter. Once again, our armies claim Tobuck and reunite us with long lost brothers and sisters. Small pockets of resistance are still being found across the region, but for the time being, the Zarantia flag can pridefully fly against Tobuck's skies!"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges:0 "Tobuckian Pledges"
 ZAR_tobuckian_pledges_desc:0 "While the population and the armies celebrate in the streets, our scribes wage another battle, not by weapons, but in pen and paper. Many communities within Tobuck still need to renew their pledges and be brought back into the fold. With the mess we have been left, this will take time..."
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes:0 "Restoring the Old Routes"
 ZAR_restoring_old_routes_desc:0 "It seems the Gun Runners' last spiteful bark at us was to blow up the roads and bridges that connected our cities. No matter, routes can be rebuilt and retraced, and those who destroyed them are gone."
 ZAR_emerald_fields:0 "The Emerald Fields"
 ZAR_emerald_fields_desc:0 "The Tobuckian Sea is known by its verdant, emerald gleam, but it's countryside where the emerald fields lie are its true treasure. Now that Tobuck is finally reunited with us, it is a simple matter of fixing those factories, and re-establishing the emerald trade. While we can't get back the profit those thieves profitted from our bounty, we can however return from where we left off."
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge:0 "Tobuckian Knowledge"
 ZAR_tobuckian_knowledge_desc:0 "The swindlers and thieves left behind a vast wealth of knowledge after we drove them from our city. It would be folly to allow it to go to waste. As such, we must collect it up and replicate it so that we may instead bend the tools of the greedy for the good of all."
 ZAR_open_for_business:0 "Open for Business"
 ZAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "As the last pockets of resistance are dealt with, and the last negotiations and pledges are made, the trading port of Tobuck is finally open for business once more! West, East or beyond, Zarantia welcomes all!"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city:0 "Taking Stock of the City"
 ZAR_taking_stock_of_the_city_desc:0 "The retaking of Tobuck was costly to both our warriors and the city itself. We must assemble an inspection team to sift through the rubble and debris to give us a clear view of the city's current problems and damage. Who knows, maybe they will stumble on something missed before?"
 ZAR_learning_from_change:0 "Learning from Change"
 ZAR_learning_from_change_desc:0 "With Tobuck finally back under our control, we can allow ourselves to look to the future. Never before our people have found themselves in such a position, holding what is truly a modern city. And even if the new task now before us is great, we have reasons to be hopeful. For Zarantia, a new chapter now opens." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_offer_assurances:0 "Offer Assurances to the People"
 ZAR_offer_assurances_desc:0 "Though those that collaborated with our enemy deserve no pity nor mercy, we must not forget why we came here.

 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay:0 "The Pearl of the Green Bay"
 ZAR_pearl_of_the_green_bay_desc:0 "Tobuck suffered for a long time under the yoke of foreign adventurers who cared nothing for its people. Under Mekiouzza's leadership Tobuck shall be reforged into a mighty city, and a true capital of an united Zarantia." #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution:0 "The Hour of Retribution"
 ZAR_hour_of_retribution_desc:0 "Mercy has its place, but not when dealing with liars and backstabbers. Their words were worth nothing, and they have caused both us and our Tobuckian kin countless woes. For that, they will die, and their deaths will serve as a warning."
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords:0 "Hunting them Down to the Last"
 ZAR_hunting_down_warlords_desc:0 "There is no escape for the scum who thought they could steal Tobuck from us. We will chase them to the edge of the world if we have to, and our vengeance will be terrible."
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world:0 "A Warning to the World"
 ZAR_a_warning_to_the_world_desc:0 "Years ago, we lost Tobuck to a band of bandits, thieves, mercenaries and cut-throats. As a flock of carrion birds they followed the Storm King there, believing they could prey on our lands undisturbed, that the Imazeeb tribes were too weak to oppose them. But now, the time has come; all shall learn the price for facing a united Zarantia!" #AAAAAAH
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong:0 "Zarantia Stands Strong"
 ZAR_zarantia_stands_strong_desc:0 "Tobuck's defences were damaged in the fighting, but also by a general lack of maintenance. Always the fools, the Gun Runners clearly were not interested in investing on their own safety. Now that we have returned, we shall rebuild the city's bastions and turn them into impregnable forts, ready to repel any invader." #AAAAAAH

 ZAR_the_eternal_federation_desc:0 "We weep for the Great Aguellid as we put her to rest, but in her wake is left a great void that cannot be filled by any one zebra. She was great, but now other zebras must stand together and each be a co-equal part of carrying what she carried alone."
 ZAR_first_among_equals:0 "First Among Equals"
 ZAR_first_among_equals_desc:0 "We honor Umalez Ataghan not as the daughter of the Great Aguellid, but also for her own efforts for our people. Yet like her, we have learned from her mother. She has a place of honor in the federation we build, but it is one among us, not above us."
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council:0 "An Ascendant Council"
 ZAR_an_ascendant_council_desc:0 "The seeds that were planted by the Great Aguellid are blooming, and the council she created has reached its true potential.

 ZAR_a_decentralised_system:0 "A System Without Core."
 ZAR_a_decentralised_system_desc:0 "No single thread in the carpet holds the entirety together, and so shall our homeland be built to endure no matter what single thread is cut."
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state:0 "A Many-Headed State."
 ZAR_a_many_headed_state_desc:0 "The Great Aguellid's shortcoming was that she was but one zebra, and that as power flowed from her, it lessened all those around her. Zarantia is not one tribe, but many, and thus every tribal chief must be part of the leadership."
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us:0 "The Desert Belongs to Us"
 ZAR_desert_belongs_to_us_desc:0 "Though the desert causes our people many woes, it is also the source of our strength. The desert is a harsh mother, but so was the Great Aguellid, and she elevated us all. We must remember that the desert does the same, and as we face her and learn from her, we will be stronger for it."
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty:0 "Sharing in Modernity's Bounty"
 ZAR_sharing_in_modernitys_bounty_desc:0 "Though we have reaffirmed the tribes, we realise that there is no going back. Though the sword has its place, the gun is ascendant, and though the caravan fed us for centuries, the train runs faster and more tirelessly. We will continue trading for these new tools and machines, and we will build our tribes with them."
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth:0 "The Hidden Wealth"
 ZAR_the_hidden_wealth_desc:0 "New tools means new discoveries out in the wild hinterlands, and every tribe knows that it will earn a good living from the metals and minerals that are found.

 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms:0 "The Desert Storms"
 ZAR_like_the_desert_storms_desc:0 "We may not have the raw industrial power of other nations, but we have the grit and the spirit that has allowed us to thrive in even the most inhospitable of lands. Let the enemy come with their armored cars and tanks and cannons, we will lead them through a merry dance across the dunes, and their sun-bleached bones will serve as a warning to the others who would threaten our home."
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands:0 "A Sanctuary in the Sands"
 ZAR_sanctuary_of_sands_desc:0 "The world is a bloody place, and countless are fleeing the ravages of war and death. We who sit in a prosperous homeland must consider that most sacred of virtues, hospitality. When you see a lost wanderer you aid them, period. The same holds true today, and just because they arrive by boats or refugee caravans, they are no less lost."
 ZAR_friends_abroad:0 "Friends Abroad"
 ZAR_friends_abroad_desc:0 "We may be watchful, but we are not hostile. Those who show honor and act honestly are worthy of respect, whether Imazeeb or not, and as the night draws close, one cannot have enough friends."
 ZAR_facing_the_future:0 "Facing the Future"
 ZAR_facing_the_future_desc:0 "Though the Imazeeb change, we have changed on our terms. We learned from the highest of us, and rose to stand as tall as her. We don't know what the future will hold, but we know that we had a good teacher, who would not accept us failing."
 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes:0 "Among the Dunes, Deliverance"
 ZAR_deliverance_amongst_the_dunes_desc:0 "The Imazeeb's greatest moment was when it swept forth from the desert to deliver the oppressed people of Tobuck. They cried out for deliverance, and we gave it. As the world grows darker, we remember this creed, and we listen. Should the oppressed and enslaved cry out, we will hear them, and we will come."

 ZAR_finding_allies:0 "Finding Allies"
 ZAR_finding_allies_desc:0 "Between our strategic position and the wealth that rests beneath the desert, we are not only strong, but we are also wealthy. Zarantia is a friend that many nations would be happy to have, and we're more than happy to formalise this."

 ZAR_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Time and tide waits for no mare. We have only started to build a strong and prosperous Zarantia, and instead of resting on our laurels, we need to launch ourselves forwards, and use the wealth we've gained to speed up our efforts."
 ZAR_settling_the_coast:0 "Settling the Coast"
 ZAR_settling_the_coast_desc:0 "With the recent chaos, the Tobuckian countryside is not nearly as populated as it should be, and we have an opportunity here.

 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads:0 "The Zarantian Railroads"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_railroads_desc:0 "Trains are loud, noisy, complicated and utterly wonderful. Hundreds of tonnes of cargo, easily enough for a great caravan, all carried at speeds we couldn't even dream of. This is more than a vehicle, it is the key to Zarantia's trading future!"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century:0 "New Century, New Laws"
 ZAR_new_laws_new_century_desc:0 "A changing society demands changing laws. What exact taxes are we supposed to apply to electronic devices? How low can the airplanes that now cross our skies fly? How shall we treat patents? There's much to decide on here."
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen:0 "Honoring the greatest Aguellid"
 ZAR_honoring_the_greatest_queen_desc:0 "Mekiouzza Ataghan was more than an Aguellid. She was the founding mother of Zarantia, the liberator of Tobuck and the one who elevated the imazeeb. As our capitol grows it might not change name, but it will be shaped in her memory."
 ZAR_amsisi_laws:0 "Amsisi Laws"
 ZAR_amsisi_laws_desc:0 "The guiding principle of our nation is and will always remain that of Amsisi, but as Zarantia grows and changes, it risks drifting away from these principles.

 ZAR_the_desert_patrol:0 "The Desert Patrol"
 ZAR_the_desert_patrol_desc:0 "Traditionally, the tribes have kept watch over their lands of the desert, but as these old duties are laid to rest, we need something else.

 ZAR_the_zarantian_court:0 "The Zarantian Court"
 ZAR_the_zarantian_court_desc:0 "Around the queen of Zarantia, a vast organisation of civil servants and bureaucrats is emerging, one that will need to be tied closely to the rest of the nation if the queen is to be able to continue her duties to the people."

 ZAR_the_buckharan_supplicants_desc:0 "The Buckharans are a strange people, and for the longest time, we've been content to mind our affairs while they mind theirs. Still, they are distant kin of the imazeeb all the same, and they've come before Umalez with their heads bowed."
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad:0 "The Trans-Zebharan Railroad"
 ZAR_the_trans_azir_railroad_desc:0 "The Zebhara has been an eternal barrier, a line across the map that divides north and south Zebrica, and the edges of it thrive off the trade that can flow past it. Yet now, the technological progress of recent years makes the impossible possible; a great road of iron cutting straight through it."
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara:0 "Liberating Buckhara"
 ZAR_liberate_buckhara_desc:0 "The Buckharans call, and we answer. If their overlords maintain their right to rule over them, we will show them that though the imazeeb have changed, their ferocity has not."

 ZAR_violence_is_authority_desc:0 "Violence is how authority is kept. If you cannot defend what is yours, thieves and invaders will take it from you.

 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance:0 "Reaching for Dominance"
 ZAR_reaching_for_dominance_desc:0 "Zarantia's fate is forged by one zebra, and the nation must be an extension of her will. My mother realized, almost too late, that the bartering and dealing that all Aguellids had engaged in prior to this left them weak. I will not make the same mistake."
 ZAR_tightening_the_grip:0 "Tightening the Grip"

 ZAR_our_own_ability:0 "Our Own Ability"
 ZAR_our_own_ability_desc:0 "The tribes' ingenuity is the greatest asset at our disposal. After all, they have the know-how in digging deep wells, even if to uncover hidden water deposits rather than oil. There's no reason to doubt that they'll adapt to the new task quite easily."
 ZAR_foreign_assistance:0 "Foreign Assistance"
 ZAR_foreign_assistance_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have delved into oil extraction long before we did.

 ZAR_the_zajhari_wells_desc:0 "Our expedition from Zajhari has returned with excellent news; new deposits have been discovered in the area. Now, they may not be as extensive as others are, but they also are not too deep underground. This will undoubtedly make extraction easier for our crews."
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture:0 "New Methods of Agriculture"
 ZAR_new_methods_of_agriculture_desc:0 "For a long time, our food production was held back by harsh environment and rudimentary techniques.

 ZAR_the_new_centurys_infrastructure_desc:0 "Long pipelines of steel now snake across our lands, delivering the precious black gold to newly-built plants in a constant flow.

 ZAR_tools_of_war:0 "All the Tools of War"
 ZAR_tools_of_war_desc:0 "Though we are tasked with throwing back the sickness that infested our lands, that does not mean we must reject all the tools it has provided. We are already tainted by it, so making use of their weapons to undo them is no sacrifice."
 ZAR_return_old_gods:0 "The Return of the Old Gods"
 ZAR_return_old_gods_desc:0 "In this struggle, we walk alongside the great gods of old, hearing names we had long forgotten. If we are to die, we can at least have done our part to ensure that the worms remain behind."

 ZAR_no_tobuck_nor_zarantia_desc:0 "Tobuck is tainted and needed to go, but the people within were slaves to the falsehoods it represented just like we were. We shall scatter them among the tribes, and they will come to hear the song of the gods as well. In the end, we shall become one after all."

 ZAR_tobuck_burning_desc:0 "With this act, we settle the old scores utterly, and teach the old, tainted world the final lesson our people's honor demanded that we teach it. This city that caused so much strife and so much contention is no more, and nobody remains to recreate it."

 ZAR_feeding_the_creation_desc:0 "The flame that burns the brightest is snuffed out all the faster for it, and though our duty is to bring about the end of the world, harsh words rocks will not avail us.

 ZAR_feeding_the_destruction:0 "Feeding the Destruction"
 ZAR_feeding_the_destruction_desc:0 "The destruction of this tainted world is a sacred duty, one that will brook no half measures.

 ZAR_quelling_the_ruins:0 "Quelling the Ruins"
 ZAR_quelling_the_ruins_desc:0 "Those that wander the devastation we've left behind are more than willing to continue to fight. It is honorable, but pointless. All will bow before Ijirmed, and as the goddess moves through these lands, they will see in the end."

 ZAR_summoning_the_elites: "Summoning the Elites"
 ZAR_summoning_the_elites_desc: "As the city is restored to Zarantian control, we must summon the old power brokers and figureheads before the Aguellid. They are still welcome under her rule, and a grand ceremony will let their return to her service be a great and honored moment."
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service: "Vasile cel Tradat at your Service"
 ZAR_vasile_tradat_service_desc: "One of Pea Shooter's accomplices - a griffon from distant Brodfeld - have remained behind when his colleague ran off. It appears that he has realised there are few places for his kind to run, and he has offered his services to the Aguellid in exchange for safety."

 ZAR_our_faithful_friends_desc: "There are those in the city who never forgot Tobuck's debt to the Zarantians, and who were ready and willing to aid us should it have come to war. These brave souls deserve to be recognized for their honor. Friendship is a valuable commodity, and we know its price."
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets: "Dancing In the Streets"
 ZAR_dancing_in_streets_desc: "Above all else, the union between Tobuck and the Imazeeb is one of mutual respect and honor, and we view the city folk not simply as subjects, but as honored friends and an integral part of Zarantia. Recent events have shaken them, however, and we need to remind them of the esteem we hold them in."
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law: "Reminding Them Of the Law"
 ZAR_reminding_them_of_law_desc: "The Tobuckians are traders at heart, and they have always strived towards new and better deals. Sometimes this is at the expense of the law, and though we accept it, we do not let it get out of hoof. Fair warning will be given, but they have always known we treat the law seriously, and they can't have expected that to change."
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance: "Reestablishing Dominance"
 ZAR_reestablishing_dominance_desc: "The city is under control, but the outlying areas which have been neglected for over a year, still go about life in their own way. They need to be made aware of the change in leadership, and that we may well come to ask them to do their part soon."

 ZAR_lessons_from_tobuck_desc: "It is a bitter pill to swallow, but there are things we can learn from Pea Shooter and his efforts here.

 ZAR_the_migration: "The Migration"
 ZAR_the_migration_desc: "The coastlines were ravaged by the Storm King more than most areas of Zarantia. Many regions lie abandoned, not the least since their inhabitants fled into the desert. Now that the lands are reclaimed, they can finally return home again."
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck: "Mayor Of Tobuck"
 ZAR_mayor_of_tobuck_desc: "He is a snake, but nocreature can deny that Vasile cel Tradat has been an indispensible asset as we restore our hold over Tobuck.

 ZAR_city_of_opportunities: "City Of Opportunities"
 ZAR_city_of_opportunities_desc: "Tobuck is a free city, one of opportunity and propsperity, over which the watchful Aguellid holds her hoof. Those who seek to earn their fortune may do so here honestly and without concern, for all of Zarantia watches vigilantly over their jewel of a city."

 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals: "Gently With Cornered Animals"
 ZAR_gently_with_cornered_animals_desc: "Pea Shooter honored his deal and departed peacefully, and many lives were spared for it.

 ZAR_lay_down_weapons: "Lay Down Weapons"
 ZAR_lay_down_weapons_desc: "It is a frustrating and drawn out dance to get them to leave, much like handling a scared, angry animal, but opening up corridors to the borders or the ports to them is having its effects. As long as we do not do anything surprising, they will depart."

 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding: "Tobuck Shipbuilding"
 ZAR_tobuck_shipbuilding_desc: "A gun can be put together by a skilled gunsmith in his home, but the notion of said gunsmith hammering away at a thousand tonne steel colossus is more like the setup for a joke. As with all things, the new age demands new kinds of workshops, and the Tobuckians have contacts."
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral: "A Curious Admiral"
 ZAR_a_curious_admiral_desc: "We are not sure where exactly he came from, nor if he actually is an admiral or just a lunatic, but he seems to know what he is doing, and he brings a cadre of capable sailors with him. From what we hear of his history, it might be prudent to keep a close eye on him."

 ZAR_eyes_in_sky_desc: "A leader must know what is going on during battle, and when one soars through the clouds at dizzying speeds, it is an entirely new world that is opened. The warriors who fly across these battlefields are something different, and we'll need to accept learning from wherever we can find it."
 ZAR_sky_warriors: "Sky Warriors"
 ZAR_sky_warriors_desc: "The foundations of aerial might is the fighter plane; a raider able to move swiftly and strike against all that would threaten our warriors below. They are a warrior's shield and first into the fight, and they will demand much of those we choose for this role."
 ZAR_flying_artillery: "Flying Artillery"
 ZAR_flying_artillery_desc: "An artillery shell weighs maybe 50 kilos, and we've seen what such a weapon can do to an entire warband. What then can a shell ten times as heavy, not fired from many kilometers away but dropped straight from above on them, do?"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers: "The Skywalkers"
 ZAR_the_skywalkers_desc: "Those who fight in the skies are a nigh tribe unto themselves, with customs and beliefs that will by necessity come to differ from their land-fighting kin. We shuldn't shy away from this, but rather embrace it. Let the Igenwan fly high, and let their stories reverberate through our history!"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare: "New Ways Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_ways_of_warfare_desc: "The menagerie of bandits, thugs and mercenaries that infested Tobuck might have been a plague, but it was a capable one. They would not have held out against the attempts to dislodge them if they hadn't been. It is just as well that we accept this fact, and study what they did to see what we can learn from it."
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare: "New Tools Of Warfare"
 ZAR_new_tools_of_warfare_desc: "The age where a rifle and a sword could carry a warrior to victory is long gone; the Storm King and his eventual defeat proved that. War is like a diamond, possessing many facets, and each one must be polished to an absolute shine."
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior: "A Hybrid Warrior"
 ZAR_a_hybrid_warrior_desc: "It is the Imazeeb way to adapt to her surroundings, and with the plethora of painful lessons we have gotten in recent years, the time has come to adapt more than ever before. The traditional warrior must die, and in its place something new - the unity of two worlds - must be born."
 ZAR_the_martial_elite: "The Martial Elite"
 ZAR_the_martial_elite_desc: "War is a craft, one that can take a lifetime to truly master, and like with many other crafts it has changed. With a thousand tools at the crafter's disposal, it takes immense training to master them all. War is no different, and this new era will be one where the masters will shine."
 ZAR_dominating_the_wilds: "Dominating The Wilds"
 ZAR_dominating_the_wilds_desc: "Moving forward does not mean to discard what you are, but it does mean you must question some things. The Imazeeb have always been masters of desert warfare, but did she rely on that too much? Tobuck is more than just desert, and we have new lessons to learn here."
 ZAR_the_big_guns: "The Big Guns"
 ZAR_the_big_guns_desc: "Whatever skills a warrior possesses, they will not avail him if he is blown to bits before even reaching the battlefield. These heavy guns will be crucial to warfare going ahead."
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge: "Importing the Knowledge of Warfare"
 ZAR_importing_warfare_knowledge_desc: "There are many places across the world that has seen war on a scale we can scarcely imagine, and whose peoples have learned many hard lessons about war. We should make sure to listen to them, and gain the lessons they learned without paying the price they had to."
 ZAR_holding_the_line: "Holding The Line"
 ZAR_holding_the_line_desc: "Imazeeb warfare has long been built on mobility, but if we are to protect Tobuck in the future, we must reconsider this attitude. While mobility will avail our forces, there will also be times where we must dig our hooves in and let the enemy break against us."
 ZAR_the_bulwark: "The Bulwark"
 ZAR_the_bulwark_desc: "It doesn't matter how fast a warrior runs, or how quickly he adapts, if everywhere he attacks he will find deep tunnels and fortified bunkers waiting for him. We know what we fight to protect, and every drop of sweat spilled in building will pay dividends in blood."

 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold: "City Of Wonders And Gold"
 ZAR_city_of_wonders_and_gold_desc: "Tobuck is as she always has been, and she has always been a wondrous city. Outsiders will preen and say 'well OUR city is greater' but they can eat sand. To us, Tobuck is a shining jewel, and the wealth and industrial might she offers us is the greatest prize."
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess: "Cleaning Up The Mess"
 ZAR_cleaning_up_the_mess_desc: "Pea Shooter left the city in a right state. Having been more interested in plundering the Storm King's arsenal than keeping the city in order, we are now left with an entire year of economic development wiped from the books. We are, in essence, starting from scratch."
 ZAR_taking_stock: "Taking Stock"
 ZAR_taking_stock_desc: ""If it has not been measured, weighed and registered, it does not exist, and the Aguellid will claim it as hers when she finds it." These words have lit a fire under the Tobuckians, and they are more than eager to register their property, their companies and their businesses with us."
 ZAR_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
 ZAR_modern_agriculture_desc: "Not even the farmer's field is safe from the march of progress, with strange new machines, fertilisers and countless new innovations making the fields more fertile than ever. Famine will truly be a thing of history going ahead."
 ZAR_reopening_the_factories: "Reopening the Factories"
 ZAR_reopening_the_factories_desc: "It has taken time, and in a couple of cases chasing down the thieves that had seized the tools and machinery, but finally the factories of Tobuck are starting to work again."
 ZAR_sprawling_roads: "Sprawling Roads"
 ZAR_sprawling_roads_desc: ""All roads lead to Tobuck" a merchant once told Mekiouzza. Admittedly he was looking to sell her something at the time, but the expression has stuck with the Aguellid ever since. If it is not true, then why not make it true?"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics: "Schools and Clinics"
 ZAR_schools_and_clinics_desc: "All this change and development is pointless if it does not benefit the entirety of our people, especially the children. Those are for whom we build this new world after all, and they need new teachers to find their place in this world as well as doctors to save them from disease or injury."
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors: "Age Of Prospectors"
 ZAR_age_of_prospectors_desc: "There is wealth out in the desert, but many times we do not know what we look for. Finding iron is one thing, but what are you supposed to look for when looking for tungsten or chromium? We'll invite any prospectors willing to come to look, and to know that we pay well for any deposits they find."
 ZAR_cash_crops: "Cash Crops"
 ZAR_cash_crops_desc: "With Tobuck's fields once again under our control, and with the food supply ensured, we can start making good use of the fields for more than just sustenance farming. There is a deep thirst in the world for things like coffee or tobacco, and we grow it well here."
 ZAR_the_trading_port: "The Trading Port"
 ZAR_the_trading_port_desc: "Tobuck's port is more than just a port, it is the gateway into all of Zarantia, and it should be one of the finest in all of northern Zebrica. The time of tripping over each other and fighting for space is over, now Tobuck shall welcome everycreature who wishes to come."
 ZAR_finally_industrialising: "Finally Industrialising"
 ZAR_finally_industrialising_desc: "With Tobuck back in prime shape, we can finally embark on that glorious old plan from years ago to let the new industry and commerce flow from Tobuck out into the rest of Zarantia. After all, when the answer to "how are we meant to industrialise" is simply to point at Tobuck and say "do that", it is much easier."
 ZAR_trade_is_king: "Trade is King"
 ZAR_trade_is_king_desc: "War and Trade have been the foundations of imazeeb life for a long time, but this too is changing. Raiding, mercenary work or tribal conflicts are becoming a thing of the past, as we all are united around the pursuit and facilitation of trade."
 ZAR_the_great_dam: "The Great Dam"
 ZAR_the_great_dam_desc: "We have worked the desert and irrigated it for centuries, and if there is any area where the modern developments thrill us, it is here. Going ahead, the desert is going to become ours to mold as we wish on a scale never before seen."

 ZAR_a_radiant_jewel_desc: "When you cross the oceans and pass by Maregypt into the Emerald Sea, you come upon Tobuck, a trading city of prosperity and progress. This city stands between worlds, be it Maregyptians or Imazeeb, Zebrica or Equus/Griffonia, or any other, but all are home here. Welcome to Tobuck, home and opportunity for anycreature."

 ZAR_revolt_against_the_modern_world_desc:0 "The madness must come to an end! We have been marched to the very brink by power hungry tyrants, and in all their hollow talk of "progress" and "modernity" they forgot to ask whether this was something any of us wanted. We now give our answer: no!"
 ZAR_return_land_to_people:0 "Return the Land to the Tribes"
 ZAR_return_land_to_people_desc:0 "Land was the first thing they sought to take from us, and we take it back. We till the land and thus it is ours, and no amount of long-winded bleating by city creatures who never worked a day in their lives can convince us otherwise."
 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders:0 "Restore Tribal Elders to Power"
 ZAR_restore_tribal_elders_desc:0 "Give a creature an inch and they take a mile, that is the truth of all autocrats, and restoring our own leaders is long overdue. The Aguellid has one duty only, and we will not allow whoever holds that position to forget that in the future."
 ZAR_peasants_not_proletarians:0 "Peasants, Not Proletarians"
 ZAR_peasants_not_proletarians_desc:0 "Though we have gotten some aid from the so called Marksists in other nations, we aren't so deluded to think that they are kin. Farming and trade is our lifeblood, not industry. Besides, someone who calls your way of life "the idiocy of rural life" shows they're no kin of yours." 
 ZAR_true_masters_of_the_desert:0 "True Masters of the Desert"
 ZAR_true_masters_of_the_desert_desc:0 "We defend what is ours, and we do so by tooth and hoof to the bitter end. Nocreature has truly conquered the imazeeb, and nocreature ever will, not as long as we never forget the price of submitting."
 ZAR_trade_not_factories:0 "Trade, not Factories"
 ZAR_trade_not_factories_desc:0 "For centuries, our lifeblood has been trade, and that will remain the case. We still provide something no other creature can - safe passage across the zebhara - and that will not change."
 ZAR_farms_in_the_sand:0 "Farms in the Sand"
 ZAR_farms_in_the_sand_desc:0 "We coax the desert to give what little it can, and over time, we have come to provide for ourselves. This is more than a grim necessity, this is our greatest achievment, and we should be proud of it!"
 ZAR_a_little_modernity:0 "Antiquity with Modern Elements"
 ZAR_a_little_modernity_desc:0 "We reject the outsiders' ways because they would destroy ours, but that does not mean we should reject it all out of hoof. There are still valuable lessons to learn, as long as they don't challenge our way of life."
 ZAR_no_exceptions:0 "No Exceptions"
 ZAR_no_exceptions_desc:0 "The outsiders' ways are a disease, and it does not matter how useful they might seem. Let one rat into the home, and you will soon have a thousand. We have no use for that which we cannot create ourselves."
 ZAR_desert_ambushes:0 "Desert Ambushes"
 ZAR_desert_ambushes_desc:0 "If an enemy comes for you, you run. You run deep into the desert, taking water where you can and lead him on a merry chase only to turn around and kill him when he's exhausted and delirious from the heat."
 ZAR_continue_flowering:0 "Continue the Flowering"
 ZAR_continue_flowering_desc:0 "Our great works in the desert are living proof that we do not need the outsiders. Are the Maregyptians making desert into farmland like we do? The Colthaginians? No, the imazeeb alone know how to make these lands fertile."
 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling:0 "Encourage Desert Settling"
 ZAR_encourage_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert may be harsh and unforgiving, but at least it does not try to break your people and make you something you're not. Our people have claimed swathes of the desert and made it livable before, and can do so again."
 ZAR_deindustrialize_tobuck:0 "Deindustrialize Tobuck"
 ZAR_deindustrialize_tobuck_desc:0 "That damned city has caused us no end of woes at this point, but the cause is too obvious. The Tobuckians have been steeped in industry and wealth, and like strong drink it has gone to their heads. We'll tear the bottle out of their hooves, and after that, maybe we can finally find accord."
 ZAR_enforce_desert_settling:0 "Enforce Desert Settling"
 ZAR_enforce_desert_settling_desc:0 "The desert is tamed through tireless work, but our people is loathe to accept others telling them what to do. Yet, if there is any place where we should push to encourage, it is in the irrigation efforts."
 ZAR_hidden_supplies:0 "Hidden Supplies"
 ZAR_hidden_supplies_desc:0 "They say that we live off sand and sunlight, and they can continue to think that. In truth, we just know how to hide supplies across the desert, and the task of creating these stockpiles is a revered position. The desert kills the unprepared, and we are always prepared."
 ZAR_community_and_tradition:0 "Community and Tradition"
 ZAR_community_and_tradition_desc:0 "The Imazeeb have endured since time immemorial through two great pillars: an eternal respect for tradition, and an ironclad community. That is all that we have ever truly needed, and we will sttle for this. We are imazeeb, no matter what the world tries to make us."

 #### Leader Descriptions ####

 ZAR_mekiouzza_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:19th of February 941 in northern Zarantia.\n\n§YBiography§!: Mekiouzza was born as the oldest child of the leader of the Ataghan tribe. Ever the precocious child, her talent for leadership showed itself when the Tobuckian envoys came to seek aid from the imazeeb tribes in throwing off the Warzenan yoke. Though not even a chief, she was the first to pledge herself to aid them and managed to both convince her parents as well as many others to join the cause. What more, her zeal impressed the Tobuckians, and as the tribes moved to liberate the city from its Warzenan overlords, the Ataghan was able to set the agenda. And within the tribe, the agenda became set by young Mekiouzza.\n\nThe victory against Warzena raised the Ataghan to the apex of their power among the tribes, and Mekiouzza was raised to become the new Aguellid - the chosen leader with the right to call the tribes to war - in recognition of her triumphs. While not officially the leader of Tobuck, the city and its surroundings knew who they relied on for protection and therefore allowed her great say in their affairs as well.\n\nEver since, Mekiouzza has worked to bring Tobuck and the imazeeb together into one, united nation akin to Colthage or Maregypt, and though the events of recent years have set her life's goal back by decades, she is nothing if not tenacious. \n\n§YPortrait By§!:Kajko and Venva"
