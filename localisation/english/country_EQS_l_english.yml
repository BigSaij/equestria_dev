#FOCUS TREES
EQS_celestia_tree:0 "Celestia's Equestria"

#NEW FOCUS LOCALISATION
EQS_pony_summit:0 "The Grand Equestria Pony Summit"
EQS_pony_summit_desc:0 "An event long rooted in Equestrian tradition, the Grand Equestria Pony Summit is a gathering of local leaders from all across Equestria in Canterlot to discuss matters with the Princesses and enjoy the local cultures that each delegate brings to the capital. With the start of the new year it is now long overdue for another summit, especially considering the state of the world as of late."
EQS_our_friends_abroad:0 "Our Friends Abroad"
EQS_our_friends_abroad_desc:0 "Equestria has quite a few friends internationally, some through historical ties, others more recent through the actions of our own Element Bearers. Despite that, we have been quite lax in maintaining our alliances and treaties. It's time for us to take a more proactive place in the world, to tighten the bonds of friendship we have crafted with others lest they slip away and leave us vulnerable."
EQS_look_northward:0 "Look Northward"
EQS_look_northward_desc:0 "Far to the north the nation of Yakyakistan lies, one of our newfound friends after finally breaking their long period of isolation. But the acceptance of Harmony has come at a cost, with the Jaks breaking off in the name of isolationism and anti-harmonic ideas taking root. Not only that, but we can not forget the topic of our former province of Severyana, more commonly known now as Stalliongrad..."
EQS_united_ponies_alliance:0 "The Harmonic Accord"
EQS_united_ponies_alliance_desc:0 "The Harmonic Accord is the official name for the series of treaties, agreements and friendships that bind Equestria to its allies in the Crystal Empire, New Mareland and Puerto Caballo. While they have generally been successful under our protection in recent years, signs still point to potential troubles on the horizon for them as well. They deserve our attention just as much as any other friend would."
EQS_support_crystal_empire:0 "The Crystal Empire"
EQS_support_crystal_empire_desc:0 "Ever since the return of the Crystal Empire, the land to our north has been our closest ally in harmony ruled by Princess Celestia's adopted niece, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. Though they have already made great strides in adapting to the modern world, they still remain under threat from many influences seeking to destroy them from within. It is only right that we offer whatever aid we can to our northern friends."
EQS_support_new_mareland:0 "The Colony Of New Mareland"
EQS_support_new_mareland_desc:0 "Far across the sea, New Mareland is a land that was long ago settled by pony explorers seeking opportunity in the east and has always remained close to Equestria. However, the ongoing economic depression has left them feeling abandoned by Canterlot and has begun to stir resentment. With recent events settled, we can finally turn our attention to providing aid to the colony."
EQS_support_puerto_caballo:0 "The Dominion Of Puerto Caballo"
EQS_support_puerto_caballo_desc:0 "Puerto Caballo is a small island nation off the southern coast of Equestria, one which has had a recent history of political instability despite our best efforts to stabilize it. Now that the political violence is behind it, we can turn our attention to aiding their economic situation. As the largest island in the Canterbbean, it may yet play a crucial role in the future of the region."
EQS_upa_training_exercises:0 "United Pony Training Exercises"
EQS_upa_training_exercises_desc:0 "Despite our similarities in race and harmony, Equestria and its subjects are far different in culture, nature and history, which has resulted in far different armed forces suited for each nation. There is much we can learn from each other, and with us all united in friendship it is time for a united training exercise to do so. Our strengths will become theirs, as will theirs become ours."
EQS_dragons_and_buffalo:0 "Dragons And Buffalo"
EQS_dragons_and_buffalo_desc:0 "In the south, the dragons and the buffalo are the two races that we have always had... difficult relations at times, to put it one way. While we were lucky enough to have the Element Bearers solve the Appleloosa issue, and now have a Dragon Lord generally friendly to Equestria, it would still be prudent to resolve our relationships with them as to prevent a potential turn to hostility and disharmony."
EQS_raven_inkwell_report:0 "The Inkwell Report"
EQS_raven_inkwell_report_desc:0 "Ever since the Canterlot Invasion of 1002, Raven Inkwell has been working by order of Princess Celestia to compile a report regarding the domestic situation of Equestria. While it has been delayed multiple times due to events such as Tirek's attack, the Storm King's invasion of Hippogriffia and the School of Friendship incident, Raven has finally informed the Princess it is ready for her review."
EQS_industry_innovation:0 "Innovation Of Industry"
EQS_industry_innovation_desc:0 "Though much of Equestria is still rural and agrarian, its large cities are some of the most modern and industrialized on the planet, leading the way to the future of ponykind. It is important more than even to encourage their progress, and ensure we remain at the forefront of industrial techniques and innovation. After all, the march to modernity is one that never ceases for anypony."
EQS_trans_equestria_railway:0 "The Trans-Equestrian Railway"
EQS_trans_equestria_railway_desc:0 "The invention of the train and railroad was one of the most important catalysts in Equestria's industrial transformation, and it continues to play a critical role in the transportation of ponies and goods across our massive nation. Continuing to support and expand our infrastructure should be one of our first priorities, so as to connect our isolated communities and their economies into one."
EQS_resource_extraction:0 "The Bounty Of Equestria"
EQS_resource_extraction_desc:0 "Equestria is a land rich in natural resources, with an overabundance in just about everything anypony could ask for. However, there are some resources particularly important for a prospective defence of Equestria which have not been utilized to their full capacity. With some effort we could gain even more from our lands while still maintaining its natural beauty and protecting local wildlife."
EQS_civilian_industry_projects:0 "Investing In The Future"
EQS_civilian_industry_projects_desc:0 "Despite our vast industrial capacity, we can not become complacent because of it. Every new factory is one that can make life for Equestrians a little more comfortable, a little more secure, and most crucially will be one more factory that can be put to use building the Equestria of tomorrow, today."
EQS_military_industry_projects:0 "For Our Own Defense"
EQS_military_industry_projects_desc:0 "We can not be blind to the threats beyond our borders, and the first step to addressing them is to be prepared for when they will strike. The weapons of war many be distasteful to many, including the Princess, but they are necessary should we need to defend ourselves. War is not something we can choose, but it is something we can be ready for."
EQS_production_bonus:0 "Made In Equestria"
EQS_production_bonus_desc:0 "Equestria is not just a modern nation; it sets the standards for modernity. Every single apple grown from a tree, every toaster from a factory line, every rifle handed to a soldier bears the mark of Equestria, a mark of quality and craftsmanship. Ponies take pride in knowing that no matter what their occupation, they showcase the best of what we as Equestrians have to offer to the world."
EQS_princesses_and_ponies:0 "Of Princesses And Ponies"
EQS_princesses_and_ponies_desc:0 "For much of Celestia's reign the role of the monarchy has been largely passive, governing through royal appointment, committee and local democracy. But as the world becomes more and more dangerous, it is clear the Princesses of Equestria will need to play a more active role in domestic affairs. Adjusting schedules and priorities to accommodate will only be the beginning of the reforms required."
EQS_modernize_education:0 "Modernize Education"
EQS_modernize_education_desc:0 "The Equestrian Education Association, or E.E.A. is a board of scholars created with the intention of overseeing all aspects of education within the nation. In recent times it has come into conflict with the Crown over the School of Friendship, resulting in total deadlock. Now that Chancellor Neighsay is more amenable to compromise however, perhaps an educational reform plan can finally be drafted."
EQS_expand_bureaucracy:0 "Expand The Bureaucracy"
EQS_expand_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The royal appointment system has served Equestria for many years, but it is clear now that it can no longer adequately handle the needs of Equestria's governance. A permanent bureaucracy, one flexible enough to tackle problems without the direct interference of the monarchy needs to be built from the ground up. Only then can the will of the Princess be more effectively enacted."
EQS_royal_meritocracy:0 "A Royal Meritocracy"
EQS_royal_meritocracy_desc:0 "All ponies chosen by the Princess for tasks of relative importance are qualified for their duties. However, a vast majority of those ponies are local elites from Canterlot, leaving countless potential candidates out from serving Equestria. With the new bureaucracy finally forming we can take the best and brightest of the nation, working in service of all of Equestria where they are truly needed."
EQS_court_reform:0 "Reform The Court"
EQS_court_reform_desc:0 "As Canterlot grew, so did its upper class. These ponies, once close to their Crown for their unique skills now mostly only care for the social life and notoriety that comes with being close to the Princess. Though we are not ones to punish for such activity, it is long past time to politely sideline them so that the Princess may focus more on pressing matters rather than waste time listening to petty disputes."
EQS_centralize_autonomies:0 "Centralize The Autonomies"
EQS_centralize_autonomies_desc:0 "Now that the bureaucracy is in place, it is finally time to tackle the issue of autonomy in Equestria. For centuries, the massive size and population of the nation has required a strong devolution of authority, with widespread reforms taking time and protracted effort. But with recent changes we can bring more national governance back to Canterlot, so that national efforts can be better coordinated."
EQS_ministry_of_defence:0 "The Ministry Of Defence"
EQS_ministry_of_defence_desc:0 "With the question of leadership in the Royal Guard now solved, reforms to Equestria's military can finally continue in earnest. Both the Guard and the Wonderbolts have made great strides in modernizing for the coming storm, but more coordination between branches is needed. To this end the Ministry of Defense shall be organized, where the leaders of Equestria's armed forces can gather to prepare effectively."
EQS_air_force_reform:0 "Wings In The Skies"
EQS_navy_expansion:0 "On The High Seas"
EQS_preparing_for_storm:0 "Preparing For The Storm"

EQS_around_the_clock_equestria:0 "Around-The-Clock Equestria"
EQS_track_down_nightmarists:0 "Track Down The Nightmarists"
EQS_integrate_lunar_guard:0 "Integrate The Lunar Guard"
EQS_integrate_lunar_guard_desc:0 "Long ago before the banishment of the Nightmare, the Lunar Guard was an equal to the Royal Guard sworn to protect the Princess of the Night. However, even after Luna's return it was never truly revived past a few ceremonial duties. That will change today, as Luna has shown interest in bringing back her old personal military detail, complete with appointing a new Captain of the Lunar Guard."
EQS_calming_the_crowds:0 "Calming The Crowds"
EQS_a_true_equal_diarchy:0 "A True, Equal Diarchy"

EQS_civil_war_start:0 "The Equestrian Civil War"
EQS_civil_war_start_desc:0 "The unthinkable has happened - Luna has once more fallen to Nightmare Moon, and her forces have split Equestria apart in a mad attempt to take over the nation. Though it saddens us all greatly to have to fight our own ponies, we are left with no choice. Onwards, for Harmony!"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul:0 "Rapid Economic Overhaul"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul_desc:0 "Our economy, already brought to the brink by over half of the country breaking away, is also nowhere near ready for supporting a full-scale war. And yet, that is what is required of it. The stagnation that has befallen Equestria must end, and every effort taken so that we may have a chance at survival. It may be painful, but it is necessary."
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization:0 "Emergency Military Reorganization"
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization_desc:0 "The Equestrian Army is undertrained, understaffed, and in complete disarray. To defend Equestria, we must rectify all of this immediately. Conscription, as distasteful as it is must be implemented, and talented new ponies to help shoulder the burden of leadership found. Princess Twilight Sparkle believes she knows a pony who may prove useful as well..."
EQS_military_government:0 "The Military Government"
EQS_military_government_desc:0 "Without Princess Celestia leading it, the government of Equestria is utterly paralyzed. In this situation it is nearly impossible to beat back the Nightmare, yet we cannot simply force Celestia to return to us either. Until she does, the administration and Equestrian high command have agreed to form a military government with her permission, to ensure the civil war ends in victory."
EQS_war_industry:0 "War Industry"
EQS_war_industry_desc:0 "Reforming the system is not enough. Even if we were to run all the industry we currently have at peak efficiency, it would still not be enough to guarantee victory. More factories must be requisitioned and built, producing the weapons and equipment that ponies need to fight back. The army and the factories will work in tandem, understanding that one without the other is nothing."
EQS_defense_of_equestria:0 "The Defense Of Equestria"
EQS_defense_of_equestria_desc:0 "The Nightmareists remain extremely aggressive in their efforts to take Equestria, as we would expect. Before we can effectively push forward to end this war, we must first end their assault. We dig in, hold the line, and let the enemy go no further. They will soon find that fighting disorganized soldiers is far different from a united and prepared defense."
EQS_end_the_stagnation:0 "End The Stagnation"
EQS_end_the_stagnation_desc:0 "Our efforts to force Equestria into the modern era have been extremely successful, but we are still not finished. Remnants of Equestria society still cling to the past, to outdated traditions that are quite frankly unsuited for the modern era. Equestria is a modern nation, and it is time to prove that in reality."
EQS_equestrian_warplan:0 "Equestrian War Plan"
EQS_equestrian_warplan_desc:0 "Our defenses are in place, and Equestria modernized. Now it is time to bring all our work together, and craft a dedicated war plan for the nation so that everything can be brought to bear against the Nightmare. Some debate exactly how harsh this plan should be on the ponies of Equestria; while victory must be achieved, what are we willing to sacrifice for it?"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare:0 "Guns Against The Nightmare"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare_desc:0 "The war continues. And as it drags on, ponies will continue to die, whether we like it or not. But if we are to ask them to die for Equestria, then the bare minimum we must do is ensure they are fully equipped to fight on the front. The brave soldiers will have their weapons, no matter the cost."
EQS_chaos_and_order:0 "Chaos And Order"
EQS_chaos_and_order_desc:0 "The rise of the Nightmare has made many ponies scared and desperate. While fear is natural, some are beginning to take matters into their own hooves, causing unacceptable chaos behind our lines that may even be the work of Lunarist infiltration. The Royal Guard is working to quell the unrest, but can we afford to tolerate such conflict in these conditions?"
EQS_help_the_refugees:0 "Help The Refugees"
EQS_help_the_refugees_desc:0 "Thousands of ponies have been displaced due to the war, whether they be fleeing across the border from the tyranny of the Nightmare or from their homes due to proximity to the frontline. Many simply wish for a new place to call home until the war is over, but such circumstances breeds resentment. And while we are a nation of friendship... we also always need more ponies on the front."
EQS_wartime_administration:0 "Wartime Administration"
EQS_wartime_administration_desc:0 "The bureaucracy of Equestria is full of talented, loyal ponies who have all proven themselves to the Princess. It is unsuited for war, as many within its ranks are unwilling or uneducated in wartime measures. Though we are grateful for their service, it may be time to find replacements more suitable for what will be asked of them in this difficult time."
EQS_wartime_laws:0 "Wartime Laws"
EQS_wartime_laws_desc:0 "The legal code of Equestria is something that has adapted and shifted with the times, though it has always officially protected the many freedoms that ponies enjoy. But now, the leniency and spirit of forgiveness that has held Equestria together takes valuable resources, a dangerous thing given our situation. Perhaps it is time to overhaul the laws to suit the times, even if only temporarily?"
EQS_together_against_nightmare:0 "Together Against The Nightmare"
EQS_together_against_nightmare_desc:0 "War is not the end of friendship, nor is it something that breaks the bonds that keep us together. Rather it creates new ones, friendships tested through the most difficult trials and shared burdens. We may fight our former friends on the battlefield, but the bonds forged in battle are unbreakable, where any soldier of Equestria is willing to put their life in the hooves of the ponies that stand by them."
EQS_new_general_staff:0 "A New General Staff"
EQS_new_general_staff_desc:0 "Full-scale war may be a struggle Equestria has never seen before, but there are still plenty of ponies willing to step up to the task of leadership. Their unique skills are what we need, especially in these desperate times. Only with effective leaders at every level of Equestria can we succeed, even if some will have to sacrifice their livelihoods in the defense of Harmony."
EQS_matter_of_thestrals:0 "Matter Of The Thestrals"
EQS_matter_of_thestrals_desc:0 "The thestrals have become a complicated subject in Equestria, even moreso than before the war began. There are still many loyal to harmony who want to fight for the Princess and Equestria. But nopony can deny that the majority of thestrals are loyal to the Nightmare now, and acts of sabotage are certain. Arguments have raged for months on what to do with them; we must close this issue."
EQS_deal_with_radicals:0 "Deal With The Radicals"
EQS_deal_with_radicals_desc:0 "Radicalism breeds radicalism. With the Nightmare willing to go to such lengths to ensure her rule over Equestria, ponies are beginning to believe we need to follow suit. A small group, comprised of religious devotees to the Princess and militaristic fanatics, have proven terrifyingly effective in their service to Equestria. But is such a precedent one we want to establish?"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists:0 "Aid The Loyalists"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Deep in southeastern Equestria, within the jungles once loyal to the Nightmare, a brave resistance led by the heroine Daring Do fight mercenaries, communists and the remaining Nightmareists to restore Harmony much as we do. Our struggle north means we do not have the resources to intervene, but we will not abandon them either. Spare volunteers and guns can be sent so that they may be victorious."
EQS_ponies_against_nightmare:0 "Ponies Against The Nightmare"
EQS_ponies_against_nightmare_desc:0 "Our armies are led by the finest ponies Equestria has to offer. Our military, once far behind on modern times is quickly becoming an effective fighting force. As the realities of war continue to push all Equestrians, they are finally standing up ready to fight for what is right. They may be afraid, but bravery is not the absence of fear. It is action in the face of it."
EQS_to_save_equestria:0 "To Save Equestria!"
EQS_to_save_equestria_desc:0 "We have done all that we can to win this war. Our soldiers are many, they are well-equiped to fight, and most importantly are willing to give their lives in defense of harmony. Now, we push forward and do not stop until the Lunarists surrender. Onward ponies, for our home! For Celestia! For Equestria!"

EQS_equestria_survives:0 "Equestria Survives"
EQS_equestria_survives_desc:0 "Equestria has defeated the Nightmare. But this was not a victory. My sister is gone, taken by the forces of evil that still live on outside Equestria. True victory will only come when they are destroyed, when nothing is left of them to plot against Harmony and Equestria. This is no time to rest - now is the time to act."
EQS_equestrian_reconstruction:0 "Equestrian Reconstruction"
EQS_equestrian_reconstruction_desc:0 "Countless innocent have lost their homes, their villages, everything from the war. It is my responsibility to ensure that their suffering is alleviated as quickly as possible, and that requires rebuilding what was taken by violence and destruction. The reconstruction will be swift, so that these physical scars of Equestria can be healed and normalcy can return to the lives of my subjects."
EQS_academic_revival:0 "Academic Revival"
EQS_academic_revival_desc:0 "Education has always been one of the highest priorities of Equestria, but the war had put a halt to much of it whether it be from conscription, damage or the discovery of treason. It is unacceptable for this state of affairs to continue, and funding will be given to ensure foals can resume learning of both Harmony and the need to defend it from evil."
EQS_royal_capitalism:0 "Royal Capitalism"
EQS_royal_capitalism_desc:0 "In the absence of regulation and authority, ponies with greed in their hearts sought only power and wealth resulting in the secession of Las Pegasus and the southwest. Never again can I allow this to happen. From this moment forward business will follow the rules I put in place for them and listen to my every command, or they will find there is no place in Equestria for them at all."
EQS_harmonized_economics:0 "Harmonized Economics"
EQS_harmonized_economics_desc:0 "Equestria's economy is a powerful tool to be used, if controlled and focused in the right direction. Under my command it will be tuned to operate exactly to Equestria's every need, and wealth will flow exactly where I desire it - success will be found by ponies faithful to Harmony and to me. No longer will there be the invisible hoof of a free market, only my own guiding it to Equestria's defence and its future."
EQS_administrative_reorganization:0 "Administrative Reorganization"
EQS_administrative_reorganization_desc:0 "The military government was effective, but I require a more flexible administration to rule Equestria effectively from Vanhoover to Manehattan. All issues will go to Canterlot, where I shall decide what is to be done about them. My authority over this land must carry the weight necessary to lead it, and the decentralization that has plagued Equestria for too long must end."
EQS_smile_new_role:0 "The New Role Of S.M.I.L.E."
EQS_smile_new_role_desc:0 "S.M.I.L.E. proved itself during the war as an efficient and capable agency under the leadership of Director Drops, but to defend Equestria it must be able to act quickly and decisively. I will give them full authority to root out the monsters hiding in Equestria and beyond using any means necessary, accountable to me and nopony else."
EQS_total_thestral_integration:0 "Total Thestral Integration"
EQS_total_thestral_integration_desc:0 "The matter of the thestrals was what set everything in motion, and was one of my greatest mistakes in ruling Equestria. This mistake is one that will exist no longer. The thestrals will be integrated and recognized as the fourth tribe of ponykind immediately, whether they or the other tribes like it or not. True Equestrians do not turn their backs on their own."
EQS_punish_radicals:0 "Punish The Radicals"
EQS_punish_radicals_desc:0 "It has been discovered that some ponies committed detestable acts against Harmony in the civil war under my name, spreading fear and hatred among ponies. This is unacceptable, and I will not tolerate such behavior or views upon the former followers of my sister. They will be punished for their actions as the traitors of Harmony they are."
EQS_release_lunar_pows:0 "Release The Prisoners"
EQS_release_lunar_pows_desc:0 "Countless ponies remain held in detainment facilities under charges of treason against Equestria for aiding my sister and her forces. This arrangement is not only unsustainable, it goes against the principle of forgiveness in Harmony. As long as they agree to return to civilian life peacefully they shall be released immediately... with a close eye kept upon them for the safety of all."
EQS_tale_of_two_sisters:0 "A Tale Of Two Sisters"
EQS_tale_of_two_sisters_desc:0 "Over the course of a thousand years, my sister's name was struck from history. This is something I will not allow again. Her name will be forever immortalized as a hero of Equestria, one who struggled against terrible evils created by the enemies of Harmony. Ponies will remember Princess Luna as she should be remembered, and Equestrians will be reminded of who truly took her from them."
EQS_lead_from_the_front:0 "Lead From The Front"
EQS_lead_from_the_front_desc:0 "It is not right for ponies to be sent off to die in my name while I sit in Canterlot waiting for a war to be won. My place is on the battlefield, leading soldiers into battle and ensuring that Equestria is victorious in any conflict personally. There is much to know about modern warfare and its tactics, but I was nothing in the past if not a fast learner."
EQS_lessons_from_nephew:0 "Lessons From A Nephew"
EQS_lessons_from_nephew_desc:0 "Prince Blueblood, my adopted nephew. Once an arrogant and abrasive noble, now a talented military theorist and Field Marshal of Equestria. He prefers a theoretical approach to lessons in the form of chess games between readings on military history. Though much has changed over the years, he still acts just as I remember he did as a foal... and his strategies at tabletop games still remain the same."
EQS_student_and_teacher:0 "A Student And Her Teacher"
EQS_student_and_teacher_desc:0 "Sunset Shimmer, my former student. Once a stubborn and snide pupil, now a talented mage and Field Marshal of Equestria. She prefers an active approach to lessons in the form of magic duels between lectures on military thinking. Though our roles may be reversed from what they were before, I will show her I can be the student just as much as I was her teacher... and that my magic has not waned in her absence."

Support_aircraft_research_desc:0 "The airplane is a griffon invention, but its implementation has spread across the known world quicker than anypony could have imagined. Now, when Equestria itself is threatened, we must divert some of our talented designers towards continuous improvement of combat planes, as it will decide the outcome of the war."

Infantry_weapons:0 "Macintosh Factory"
Infantry_weapons_desc:0 "Investing into the famous Macintosh Factory will attract more engineers. That way, our soldiers can be provided with new, better guns. It is simply the army's largest need, and we can't let our ponies go without a decent weapon."
Appeal_to_STG:0 "Request Stalliongrad's Help"
Appeal_to_STG_desc:0 "Stalliongrad has never had a reason to hold any love for Equestria or the Princess, but they must see reason in the current situation. If [CHN.GetLeader] and their monstrous army is allowed free reign over Equestria, they will quickly finish off Stalliongrad as well. Everypony knows Stalliongrad has been massing troops and materiel for a while, their help could be a turning point in this conflict."
faction_research:0 "All Ponies Joint Research"
faction_research_desc:0 "While their societal structure seems odd to an average pony, there's no doubt Stalliongrad has been pushing new boundaries in the area of science ever since they've secured independence. It shouldn't be much of a problem to expand our military cooperation to include researchers, as well."
military_coordination:0 "Military Coordination"
military_coordination_desc:0 "The assistance we've received thus far has been more than welcome, but Stalliongradian commanders do not readily seek to coordinate with their Equestrian counterparts. It would be logical to assume they fear some kind of foul play coming from our hooves, thus [EQS.GetLeader] must secure a more closely working relationship with the General Secretary to ward off any such suspicions."
STG_tank_projects:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Projects"
STG_tank_projects_desc:0 "Although we already have an extensive armour programme ourselves, the Stalliongradian military has come up with ingenious models themselves. They've been perfecting their tank doctrine, as well, which will undoubtedly prove crucial to counter the changeling Panzers. Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from their designs."
Extreme_measures:0 "Extreme Measures"
Extreme_measures_desc:0 "Our dark times call for extreme measures - the state we had prior to war will lead us to defeat. Bureaucracy, corruption, laziness, self-interest: this must all be eradicated in every facet of the state. Equestria shall not fall! It will live on!"
War_Plan:0 "War Plan"
War_Plan_desc:0 "We need to conscript more ponies, build more factories, and produce more equipment in order to fuel our ever growing war machine. Let us finally address these concerns: several plans have been drafted to best resolve this situation, but we only need to implement one."

Forget_magic_of_friendship_desc:0 "For the longest time, peaceful and friendly cooperation with each other has solved almost any problem ponies have come across.

EQS_WMD:0 "Equestrian Weapon of Mass Destruction"
EQS_WMD_desc:0 "We are on the brink of developing a new weapon, one that our scientists say will bring about a quick end to the war, though at the cost of massive collateral damage. Still, desperate times call for desperate measures."
Nuclear_Power:0 "Magic-Nuclear Power"
Nuclear_Power_desc:0 "Lessons from our WMD programs have allowed us to merge the branches of magic and nuclear energy, forming a new terrifying source of power. Both the civilian and military uses of this development are evident, and must be exploited."
worrisome_changelings:0 "Changeling Problem"
worrisome_changelings_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis and her changeling army have long been a thorn in our side; they have attacked us once, and they will surely do so again. We must be prepared. We have several options to implement before an actual war breaks out."
EQS_airfields:0 "Airfields of Central Equestria"
EQS_airfields_desc:0 "In order to better protect our heartland, we should construct additional airfields in the interior to allow more coverage from our planes. In times of war, they will ensure that our skies are safe."
EQS_airfields2:0 "Airfields of Southern Equestria"
EQS_airfields2_desc:0 "We ought to connect the regions of Equestria with air bridges. In case of war, we will have to protect our skies, not to mention it will allow increased coverage and tactical options for our planes."
reinforce_border:0 "Border Fortification Plan"
reinforce_border_desc:0 "The changelings have become increasingly aggressive towards their neighbours, Equestria included. In light of this, we must commence fortification efforts along our common border. While our military experts do not think it will ensure victory on its own, it will be a delayer until we can rouse the rest of Equestria."
Improve_relations:0 "Common Enemy"

Remove_Harmonic_Stagnation:0 "Renovate Political System"
Remove_Harmonic_Stagnation_desc:0 "For the longest time, the practice of Harmony within our land has brought us peace and prosperity. It has, however, failed us and has allowed for war to come to our very doorstep. If we wish to survive this struggle, we must restructure our decentralized and democratic political system into something more... pragmatic."
Suppress_bureaucracy:0 "Eradicate Bureaucracy"
Suppress_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our bloated bureaucratic system is simply not suited for war. We must streamline it, and make it much easier and quicker for us to implement changes and decisions. It is regrettable, but the war won't be won on triplicate paperwork."

industry_manehattan_desc:0 "Manehattan is not only our largest urban centre, but an industrial powerhouse as well. Where else should we invest but in the booming metropolis? This is what we need to get our industry to start growing. Expanded steel mills will be able to supply facilities across the entire nation."
industry_las_pegasus:0 "Las Pegasus Toaster Factories"
industry_las_pegasus_desc:0 "While certainly not famed for military production, the city of Las Pegasus is very much an oasis for civilian industry. We should encourage further growth by investing in factories that already produce many consumer goods for the civilian populace."
mil_industry_fillydelphia:0 "Fillydelphia Automobile Factories"
mil_industry_fillydelphia_desc:0 "The car is a still relatively new and costly product for Equestrians to explore. It is best for us to attempt to spread it further through Equestria, to both rich and poor alike. Such production facilities could also be repurposed for military use during times of crisis."
Spitfire_research:0 "Spitfire Research"
Spitfire_research_desc:0 "Equestria is filled with flying ponies and even floating cities. It would be silly not to invest in strong, resilient airplanes to allow others to fly as well. A well maintained airforce can become crucial should a conflict arise, as well..."
industry_crystal_emp:0 "Industrialise Crystal Empire"
industry_crystal_emp_desc:0 "While the crystal ponies to our north are faithful allies of ours, their nation is not yet very developed. We must support them in industrialising their nation. This could become a very wise decision for the days to come."

eqs_southern_roads:0 "Southern Roads"
eqs_southern_roads_desc:0 "With the integration of the Buffalo tribes into Equestria, it is time that we made good on our promises and develop the local infrastructure in the area. The ponies and buffalo will be able to travel more easily between towns and villages, and our local industry would benefit from this, as well."
southern_industry:0 "Southern Resources"
southern_industry_desc:0 "Owing to the normalisation of relations between pony and buffalo, the southwest of Equestria is open towards further modernisation and exploitation of natural resources. In accordance with the drawn up agreement, areas considered of traditional importance to the buffalo will be avoided, while the "safe zones" are open for development and settlement."
EQS_industry_of_the_south:0 "Industry of the South"
EQS_industry_of_the_south_desc:0 "Stableside and Baltimare are industrial centres of the southern region. However, for a long time investors turned away from these places. There's no reason to believe that the south is not profitable. We no longer need to be blinded by these illusions. Factories for the south! And while you're at it, begin aluminium production in Tenochtitlan."
EQS_infrastructure_of_jungles:0 "Jungle Railway"
EQS_infrastructure_of_jungles_desc:0 "The jungles of southeastern Equestria have been all but impassable for a long time. Most of the development has been focused on coastal cities, due to the fear of native pony tribes in the jungles. In order the exploit the vast potential in resource the jungles hold, we shall invest in building new roads and railways through the jungle, while respecting the known habitats of hostile tribals."

tenochtitlan_state_university:0 "Stableside State University"
tenochtitlan_state_university_desc:0 "Equestria has many facilities for higher education, one of them being Baltimare University, but issue is that Baltimare is the sole location in the southeast containing such faculties. Many talented ponies miss out on learning further, because they simply cannot afford to travel and live in northern cities. The formation of a state sponsored university in Stableside should alleviate the problem."
southern_naval_bases:0 "Southern Naval Bases"
southern_naval_bases_desc:0 "Equestria boasts the longest coastline in the world, but the development and construction of new dockyards, wharves and piers has not kept up with the growth. Given the obvious lack of such facilities on the southeast shores, it would be prudent to fill the gap, thus giving our navy a new base to repair and fuel from."
EQS_portland_fishing_port:0 "Portland Seaweed Farms"
EQS_portland_fishing_port_desc:0 "If we support the coastal farms in Portland, they can supply the entire region with nutritiuous seaweed. With the influx of food, prices will fall and allow for local towns to grow at a steady pace, which will attract the industrial concerns to set up local businesses. Hopefully, this will solve the issue of unequal region wealth."
need_to_reinovate:0 "Innovation of Industry"
need_to_reinovate_desc:0 "No matter how you wish to put it, our industry must keep adapting in these new, changing times. Mass production lines, machine tools, efficient production methods, and more will ensure our industry remains the best in the world."
arms_potential:0 "Star Energy for Tall Tale"
arms_potential_desc:0 "Star Energy Corporation announced that it is planning to expand its branches in the city of Tall Tale. In the light of recent events, the Equestrian government considers modernization and growth of weaponry production a top priority task, hence the expansion and the further development of the arms factories in the region will be funded from the state budget."

eqs_support_status_quo_desc:0 "What some historians call the Pax Celestia has remain a constant over the past thousand years, even as fortunes rose and waned around the wider world. This is a clear fact, what the Princess has built was made to last, and our efforts should be towards maintaining her golden mean."

magical_crypto_machines:0 "Magical Crypto Machines"
magical_crypto_machines_desc:0 "Magic acts as an effective multiplier to many difficult problems. A dozen earth ponies can raise a barn with no issue, but a skilled unicorn could achieve it all on their own, saving time and labour. This force should find plentiful use in one of the new, rapidly expanding technologies - cryptographical machines. A good cypher is always shifting and never clear."

EQS_ease_the_rules_of_EEA_desc:0 "For a thousand years, the EEA has kept Equestrian education in its cold grasp. With a tight, outdated and restrictive ruleset, their authority over our institutions has become a big problem. It's time to cut down on their rules and authority, and allow our ponies to teach and research things more independently - their own way."
EQS_strengthen_EEA_authority_desc:0 "For a thousand years, the EEA has ensured that everypony in Equestria receives only the most high quality education.

EQS_prewar_diplomacy_category_desc:0 "Friendship does not usually thrive with those who wait. All across the world, our friends fight on in an everchanging world, one that may prove to not be so kind to the ideals of Harmony. While we always strive to uphold peace and reconciliation, that does not mean we will watch as our friends are in danger. We have a responsibility to act, and act we must, for the good of all creatures."
EQS_aid_velvet:0 "Support Queen Velvet"
EQS_aid_velvet_desc:0 "Queen Velvet, rightful monarch of Olenia has come under attack by the Changeling Lands and Queen Chrysalis, who no doubt will look to Equestria next after she is finished with the deer. The Equestrian ponies do not support a direct intervention, at least not yet, but that does not mean we will leave our fellow harmonic monarch out to face this grave threat alone. We will send all we can to them so that they can fight back against the changelings, and defend their homeland from the invaders who would seek to subjugate all of Equus."
EQS_support_the_yaks:0 "Support the Yaks"
EQS_support_the_yaks_desc:0 "Every day, it looks more and more likely that the only possible conclusion to the Yak-Jak feud will be through war. This is deeply regrettable, though it does not mean we will not support our friend Prince Rutherford in his struggle. He trusted us with his Kingdom in his acceptance of Harmony, and now it is time for us to return the favor."
EQS_yak_pony_friendship_treaty:0 "Yak-Pony Friendship Treaty"
EQS_yak_pony_friendship_treaty_desc:0 "Now that the Yak-Jak war is over and the Yaks have remained true to Harmony, we can officially sign a treaty of friendship between our two races, promising to forever come to each other's aid should we need it. While we can hope that it will never have to be put to use, the Yaks too believe it is only a matter of time before Equestria is threatened; when that day comes, we will be glad to have them by our side."
EQS_shelter_prince_rutherford:0 "Shelter Prince Rutherford"
EQS_shelter_prince_rutherford_desc:0 "Yakyakistan has fallen to dark influences, ones against Harmony and the rightful rule of Prince Rutherford. However, the remaining harmonists led by the Prince and a former student of the School of Friendship, Yona, have made the long trek south to Canterlot where they have sought refuge until they can return to free Yakyakistan. Though their country is lost, we still stand, and will provide them with whatever they need until they can someday return home."
EQS_reapproach_stalliongrad:0 "Reapproach Stalliongrad"
EQS_reapproach_stalliongrad_desc:0 "While the new General Secretary of Stalliongrad, Vasiliy Pantsushenko is still certainly a revolutionary and communist at heart, he has notably been less hostile towards us than past leaders. Perhaps now, an official reapproachment is finally possible; a thawing of relations could only benefit both of us, should they choose to accept it."
EQS_issue_stalliongradian_embargo:0 "Officialize the Embargo"
EQS_issue_stalliongradian_embargo_desc:0 "We and Stalliongrad have never had the best relations when it came to trade, especially as businessponies were not exactly excited as the prospects within a revolutionary state. However, things have changed; it is clear now that they are actively seeking our downfall with their harsh rhetoric. While a repeat of the Winter Revolution is the last thing anypony wants, we can at least officialize the embargo placed upon them, and ask our friends to follow suit in isolating this threat."
EQS_buffalo_integration:0 "Talks with the Buffalo"
EQS_buffalo_integration_desc:0 "The buffalo have long been pushed back from their ancestral homelands, retreating from pony settlers who made their way south long ago. The Appleloosa incident only marked the natural consequence of letting the issue run unresolved; we can only do so much for the buffalo in and out of our lands while they remain nominally independent. Hopefully they will see reason in becoming a part of Equestria, so that we can fix the mistakes we've made together."
EQS_save_the_buffalo:0 "Save the Buffalo"
EQS_save_the_buffalo_desc:0 "The buffalo have fallen to dark words, revanchist promises that have turned them against us. While their rhetoric has a center of truth to it, their reaction does not bode well for Equestria, or the ponies that now live in the south. There is only one option left available to us; war, to save our friends like Chieftess Strongheart and to protect our ponies before they attack us first."
EQS_integrate_buffalo_states:0 "Integrate the Buffalo"
EQS_integrate_buffalo_states_desc:0 "With the Buffalo now fully a part of Equestria, we can integrate them as an official new part of the nation, with all the benefits and protections it confers.

EQS_dragon_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Dragon Isles to our south, long uncomfortable neighbors who have been less than courteous to us ponies, are now under a new Dragon Lord Ember who is much more receptive to official overtures than past leaders. Spike, Princess Twilight Sparkle's faithful assistant, has offered to visit the Dragon Lord on our behalf, and hopefully seek a more amenable relationship between our two nations.

EQS_central_equestria_railroads:0 "Finish the Central Railroads"
EQS_central_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The central rail lines, stretching across the heart of Equestria, were some of the first built after the invention of the train and have been well-maintained for over a century due to substantial oversight from the Crown. However, several important planned connection lines and expansions were never finished due to geographical difficulties, magical beast attacks, national crisises, or even just some ponies not exactly wanting a train going by in their backyard. A small increase in funding could see these projects finally completed."
EQS_eastern_equestria_railroads:0 "Expand the Eastern Railway Lines"
EQS_eastern_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The east coast of Equestria is in many ways the industrial heartland of the nation, with many of our largest cities and highest concentrations of industry settled along the Celestial Sea. The rail lines leading east from Canterlot are some of the most modern in the world, yet there are many sublines that were never completed as attention shifted westward following incidents involving the buffalo and changelings. However, funding the infrastructure expansion recommended by the cities could turn an already developed region into a true industrial powerhouse."
EQS_western_equestria_railroads:0 "The Tall Tale Rail Extension"
EQS_western_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The west has long been a largely rural and agrarian region of Equestria, settled by earth ponies who migrated westward in search of fertile land. As such, not much infrastructure was built independently from the state as there was a large disinterest in the new inventions of modernity. This changed following the Canterlot Attack when the Crown realized how important it was to remain connected with all its regions, especially ones so close to the changeling border. These cities must be well supplied should war ever come to our borders, which seems more likely by the day."

And while these are almost all very important things, our delicate relationship with the buffalo have made it very difficult to establish the necessary infrastructure in the region. However, now that said relationship has been fully resolved we can go ahead with our plans drawn up together with the buffalo, for the mutual benefit of them and the ponies of Equestria."
EQS_southeastern_equestria_railroads:0 "The Ayacachtli-Tenochtitlan Connection"
EQS_southeastern_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The southeast is a very difficult region to establish infrastructure and rail in, for very obvious reasons. The jungle, the brewing hostility between the Neighua and various thestral tribes, the communist movements in Baltimare, and other such problems have historically made it a very unattractive place to invest funds in. With the thestrals finally properly integrated into the nation, however, their help can be invaluable in finally connecting their homeland to the rest of Equestria."

##NEW IDEAS##

EQS_harmonic_stagnation:0 "Harmonic Stagnation"
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_desc:0 "While the thousand years reign of Celestia has brought untold prosperity to Equestria, so too has it brought complacency and stagnation to its society. Ponies are reluctant to adopt new ideas or technologies, preferring their old traditions instead, and the system of royal appointment makes responses from Canterlot unacceptably slow. Life in Equestria may have never been better, but it is no question that the nation is unsuited for the realities of today."
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_3:0 "Harmonic Stagnation"
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_3_desc:0 "Much has been done to rapidly construct and overhaul a new Equestrian bureaucracy, and ponies are rapidly waking up to the necessity of modern technology and concepts to survive in today's era. With time and a little more effort, Equestria will finally have shaken off its stagnation and be ready to bring its full capacity to bear."
EQS_friendship_magic:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
EQS_friendship_magic_desc:0 "Friendship between ponies has been the defining feature of Equestria for countless generations. Conflict is resolved using words, not violence, and the mere thought of causing somepony else intentional harm is enough to give many shudders. Unfortunately, our enemies may not have such qualms about the use of violence... or war."
EQS_outdated_military:0 "Outdated Military"
EQS_outdated_military_desc:0 "Equestria's military is, putting it extremely mildly, woefully underequipped and unprepared for any sort of modern large-scale conflict. Military theory is a field practically unheard of until recently, and the few volunteers in the armed forces are disorganized and lack any real experience. The events of the last decade in addition to pushes by Celestia have begun to fix the many issues of the Equestrian military, but much remains to be done."

EQS_princess_luna_idea:0 "Princess Luna"
EQS_princess_luna_idea_desc:0 "Princess Luna is the younger sister of Celestia, the Princess of the Moon and a diarch of Equestria. Having recently returned from her thousand-year banishment thanks to the help of Twilight Sparkle, she has spent the last few years acclimatizing to the modern era and settling into her old role. Despite this, she has maintained a passive position in modern Equestrian politics, preferring to let her sister take the lead on most decisions and instead focusing on her duties in the realm of dreams."
EQS_thestral_divide:0 "The Thestral Divide"
EQS_thestral_divide_desc:0 "Thestrals, more commonly known as batponies, are the fourth tribe of ponies with a long history separate from that of the other three tribes. This has resulted in a population separate from mainstream Equestrian society, a problem which only worsened following the banishment of Princess Luna due to the thestrals regarding her as a divine entity of their sacred moon. Even now many thestral communities remain isolated and are reluctant to join their fellow ponies, while the other tribes remain wary of their nocturnal siblings."

EQS_bad_tanks:0 "Unfamiliarity with Modern Warfare"
EQS_bad_tanks_desc:0 "Though Equestria's military knowledge is lacking in many areas, nowhere is it more apparent than in the budding field of armored warfare. Equestria's tank models themselves may be up to date, but tactics and divisional organization properly utilizing them is something almost nopony in Equestria's budding military command understands. Combined with an aversion to the necessities of trench warfare, the Equestrian Army will need real practical military experience to solve these issues."

Combined with an aversion to the necessities of trench warfare, the Equestrian Army will need more real practical military experience to solve these issues."
EQS_bad_tanks3:0 "Unfamiliarity with Modern Warfare"
EQS_bad_tanks3_desc:0 "Equestria's military knowledge and experience is slowly ending, with armored warfare finally being incorporated into doctrinal and tactical organization within the armed forces. However, while the high command may have gotten over their inexperience, much of the Equestrian army still suffers from an aversion to the necessities of trench warfare critical for holding a defensive line.

equestria_prewar.1.d:0 ""My little ponies." The crowd, gathered in front of the stage and consisting of ponies of all types became silent. "Thank you all for joining us once again in the Grand Equestria Pony Summit and representing your cities across all of Equestria. Many of you have traveled far, and we hope that here we can all come together and enjoy the bonds of friendship that brought us together so long ago."\n\nThe Equestrians, made up of mayors and businessponies alike all clapped their hooves politely for Princess Celestia. She waited for them to finish before motioning for both Luna and Twilight to step forward with her. "We understand that some of you may have worries or concerns to bring up with us. And as Princesses of Equestria, we promise you that we will be here to listen and help in any way we can. All of us may have troubles, but if we work together I am sure we can all move past them together."\n\nAnother round of applause. Princess Twilight took center stage, lightly coughing this time to get the ponies to settle down. "But most of all, we hope you can enjoy your time in Canterlot. With more ponies here than any other summit in the history of Equestria, we're sure that the next three days will be more productive, interesting and exciting than ever before! And remember, everypony...""
equestria_prewar.1.a:0 ""...Friendship is magic!""

equestria_prewar.2.t:0 "Realities of the Future"
equestria_prewar.2.d:0 "Three days later, it was over. The delegates, having spent days and nights talking, eating, drinking and enjoying their time in Canterlot were all gone, having left back to their home cities. Most had gone home happy, some were merely satisfied, but very few left particularly nervous or worried.\n\nThe same, however, could not be said of the Princesses who had remained.\n\n"I hope you two have better news than I do," Twilight said, her formalities dissipating as she sat down exhausted. "Mayor Rokenhar of Las Pegasus is worried about food imports, Mayor Goldwin of Vanhoover is having trouble with the recent refugees from Olenia, and some of the ponies from Trotsas were complaining about fights with the local buffalo."\n\n"I fear that what I have been told is not any less concerning, Princess Twilight. Mayor Ash Moustache of Baltimare expressed his concerns to me about the work of Stalliongrad from the north within the city. And then there is the matter of the thestrals, too..." Luna looked away from her fellow royals. "It seems that there are many still reluctant to rejoin Equestrian society again, even after my return." The Night Princess looked back up at Celestia, who seemed to be distant from the conversation. "What about you, sister? What have you learned from our subjects?"\n\nThe Princess did not speak for a few moments. "The mayor of Acornage voiced her concerns with me earlier today," she said finally, looking at neither of them. "The changeling presence on the border grows more worrying by the month. She assured me of her efforts to keep relations between ponies and the remaining changelings in the city friendly, but... many believe that Equestria will soon be facing a new threat." Celestia looked at Luna, then at Twilight.\n\n"One unlike any we have seen before.""
equestria_prewar.2.a:0 "We will have to take all of this into consideration..."

equestria_prewar.3.t:0 "Looking Forward"
equestria_prewar.3.d:0 "The Raven Inkwell report, barring its name, was relatively unremarkable in comparison to the other files that had made their way to Princess Celestia throughout the past decade. The prose was exceedingly formal and full of legalese, which partially explained the sheer scale of the stack of papers which made up the report. Of course, few would expect anything less from Celestia's personal assistant; the mare was notoriously meticulous, and had been working on the task of compiling Equestria's domestic situation for years now in her spare time.\n\nThe contents of the first half were all issues Princess Celestia expected to see being raised. Equestria's industrialization was moving at a snail's pace outside of the major cities despite the current economic prosperity, and the deadlock between the Crown and the EEA over the past decade had resulted in outdated curriculums and a lack of institutions for higher education in rural areas. Nothing too notable or controversial.\n\nHowever, the second half of the report painted a much more cynical picture. The thestrals remained an issue which would need to be addressed sooner or later. The Equestrian bureaucracy, long an ad hoc structure built by Canterlot elites and trained staff desperately needed an overhaul. In particular scathing criticism was leveled at the system of royal committees and appointments, which was deemed unacceptably inefficient and slow in tackling any serious issue. And worst of all, attempting an effective national military reform program would be all but impossible with how autonomously the regions and villages of Equestria were currently operating.\n\n"These suggested reforms are... quite extensive, Raven," Celestia commented as she set the massive file off to one side. "Are you certain all of this is truly necessary?"\n\n"Princess, with all due respect, not every problem in Equestria can be solved by you or Princess Twilight and her friends traveling to fix it themselves. Even Fancy Pants has recognized that his peers are not flexible enough to handle everything Equestria needs to address so quickly. And if we want to make real change on a national level, it needs to start here."\n\nThe alicorn nodded in agreement. At least Luna would be happy; she never had the patience for dealing with the system of appointments, especially when the candidates were often so arrogant. Perhaps she would even enjoy finding their permanent replacements..."
equestria_prewar.3.a:0 "At least we have a plan to follow now."

equestria_prewar.4.t:0 "The Captain of the Royal Guard"
equestria_prewar.4.d:0 ""Sergeant Flash Magnus reporting for duty, Your Highness!"\n\nPrincess Celestia regarded the ancient hero before her, still wearing his armor from the Royal Legion of Cloudsdale. It stirred a bit of sentimentality in the alicorn; she could remember back in the earliest days when it was still in use by the pegasi. It was only shortly after Luna's banishment that the Legion was disbanded and absorbed into either the Royal Guard or the Wonderbolts. Their last captain became the first Captain of the Royal Guard - yet another case of history repeating itself now. Celestia always appreciated the cyclical nature of history.\n\n"Rise, Flash Magnus," she commanded. Those in the guard usually appreciated the sacred nature of ceremony, and Flash was certainly no different. "With Prince Shining Armor predisposed in the Crystal Empire, I am in need of a new Captain. Do you accept this duty, and swear to lead the Protective Pony Platoons in the defence of Equestria and its creatures until your last breath?"\n\n"I do, Your Highness."\n\n"Then by the authority invested in me by the Three Tribes of Equestria, I hereby name you the new Captain of the Royal Guard. May you serve with distinction and honor." The alicorn dipped her head to touch each of the pegasus' shoulders with her horn. Once she was finished Flash Magnus gave a single salute before turning and marching back down the Royal Hall, the Royal Guards stationed now saluting him in turn.\n\nIt was a bit of a shame, having to replace Shining Armor. He had served well as the Captain ever since Celestia had been forced to sack his predecessor due to the Stalliongrad incident. But with his duties in the Crystal Empire now, it was simply impossible for him to maintain an active role in Canterlot with his duties. Perhaps in an earlier time this would not have been a problem, but now... well, she needed someone with dilligence and competence to turn the outdated Royal Guard into something for the modern era.\n\n"Fare thee well, Captain Magnus," Celestia said quietly, slipping back into an older tongue. "We wish you the best of luck.""

equestria_prewar.5.t:0 "A New Director" #Writer: Indigo
equestria_prewar.5.d:0 "Sweetie Drops stepped out of the hidden elevator and breathed a long, low sigh at the familiar stone-hewed hallway within Mount Canterhorn. S.M.I.L.E. headquarters still looked almost exactly like it had almost a decade ago, minus the hastily packed boxes and burning wastebins of files on monsters. This late in the night, only a few lights were on under closed doors, including the Director's office. Sweetie Drops paused before pushing open the door; a faded 'Happy Retirement!' banner had been stuffed into the nearby trashcan. "Bon Bon" couldn't help but snort. "Just when I thought I was out..."\n\n"They pull you back in," Princess Celestia finished, sitting alone behind the Director's table. She levitated up a slice of cake on a plate. "Saved you a slice, but Director Furlong's already gone home to his family." Her look was warm, friendly, but a bit desperate. Sweetie Drops accepted the slice and sat down across from the Princess, inclining her head. "I know you've built a life beyond this organization," Celestia began, "but I was hoping you would accept my nomination."\n\n"I enjoy baking," Sweetie Drops shrugged. "Why me, Princess? Surely there's other ponies that kept up with the times."\n\n"There are," Celestia agreed. A fork spun in the air as she toyed with her own barely-touched slice of cake. "And who knows how many are already known by the changelings and Stalliongrad? It took Furlong over a year just to find you in deep cover." She frowned. "There's a reason he recommended you, Agent Drops. We're making changes. It won't be like last time."\n\nSweetie Drops swallowed. "If I'm coming back full-time, Agent Lyra is coming with me. She knows too much already, and I'm not hiding my life from her anymore."\n\n"Done," Celestia agreed. "Let me get out of your chair." The alicorn smiled a bit more genuinely. "Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to bring S.M.I.L.E. into the new millennium." Director Drops rolled her eyes."

equestria_education.1.d:0 "It was a rather large folder, all things considered. Much larger than what he was used to being sent from the Crown. Almost certainly put together by Celestia's aide rather than the Princess herself, given the lack of emphasis on friendship within its proposals. "I see no issue with implementing these proposals into the EEA's annual agenda," Chancellor Neighsay said to the alicorn across the table. "Provided that we are given adequate funding, I agree with the necessity of updated curriculums and an expansion of educational facilities. The other officials across Equestria will be notified of these changes during our next meeting here in Canterlot."\n\nCelestia respectfully nodded her head. "I trust in your ability to ensure these reforms are completed across Equestria. The EEA will receive any support and funding required, as it always has."\n\n"Indeed." Neighsay frowned. He knew what he was about to ask was unwise at every conceivable level, but his inquisitive mind would not let it go. "Princess, if I may ask... my actions at Princess Twilight's school were inexcusable. Were it not for her efforts I would have destroyed Equestria's attempts at making allies for years, perhaps even decades. I was expecting a demand for resignation or a notice for my replacement, not this attempt at reconcilation. Why leave me in charge of the EEA, when you could so easily have appointed somepony else in my stead?"\n\nNow it was Celestia's turn to frown. Neighsay's office was usually dark with little sunlight; Celestia's magic opened the blinds allowing the gentle evening light into the room. "You're right," she finally responded, "I could have replaced you after what happened at Twilight's school. And I was sorely tempted to, given the circumstances. But what you have already accomplished with the EEA, something you created has been nothing short of exceptional. It is ponies like you that Equestria needs, and you have more than shown your willingness to make up for your past mistakes."\n\n"I... don't quite understand, Princess."\n\nA faint smile tugged at Celestia's muzzle again. "I believe you will in time, chancellor," she said as she stood up to leave. "You always were one to learn through example as a student, weren't you? None of us ever truly stop learning." She paused at the doorway. "Should you need anything else, Raven can schedule another appointment for us. Until then, Neighsay."\n\nThe door closed behind her, and only a few seconds passed before Neighsay summoned a quill and began to write. There was a lot of work to do."

"Just last week their homework was about weather patterns! And have you seen how heavy their saddlebags are from all the books they carry home? How is a pegasus or unicorn supposed to carry them home?"\n\n"Pound told me that he and Pumpkin share so that they each only have to bring half of them home. It certainly is a lot different from back when we were foals in the schoolhouse learning about cutie marks and Winter Wrap Up-"\n\n"Mom!" a different voice from before yelled. "Can you get me my science textbook?" A moment of silence. "Nevermind, I don't need it!"\n\nThe two earth ponies didn't speak for a few seconds. "Neither of us know how to use magic or fly," Cup Cake finally said quietly. "How are we supposed to teach them when everything seems to be so new? They're learning things for unicorns and pegasi too, not just earth ponies..."\n\nCarrot Cake trotted over and gave his wife a quick hug. "No matter what, they're still our kids," he reassured her. "We might not be able to teach them everything, but we can be there for them when they need us. That's what most important as a parent, right?"\n\nThe two pulled each other into another deeper embrace.\n\n"...Dad, do you know where Bales is?""

The passage of such worked differently for her after all, at least compared to most. But with the turning of the new millennium, ever since her sister had finally returned, there was just so much to do. Overseeing the military reforms with her nephew, keeping up with appointments for all the social events of Canterlot... Celestia would be forever grateful to her subjects like Raven who made it possible, but they could only do so much. She hoped it would be enough.\n\n"Sister?"\n\nThe Princess of the Sun looked up to see Luna enter her study, quietly closing the door behind her. "Yes, Luna?" Celestia responded, putting away the reports she had been going over. "Is something wrong?"\n\nLuna seemed to hesitate for a moment. "I... the thestrals, sister, it isn't right. We do not blame you, but they have been separate from Equestria for far too long. My dreams, they show me division and distrust that I have caused."\n\n"Luna, that wasn't your fault. I am sure that together we can fix it, with the help of-"\n\nThe younger diarch shook her head before motioning to the stack of reports Celestia had set aside.

It has taken far too long for me to learn the new ways of ruling, leaving you alone to face the threats of Equestria. This is something I want, nay, need to do alone."\n\nA hint of worry flashed across Celestia's muzzle that she quickly buried in favor of a light smile. "Of course, Luna," she said warmly, "just remember that I will never be too busy for you. Should you need help, please just let me know."\n\nLuna beamed. "...Thank you, sister.""

equestria_moonshine.2.d:0 "Celestia awoke to a palace in chaos. Organized chaos, the kind she had become mostly used to, but still chaos.\n\nOne of the larger side rooms had been turned into a makeshift command center, at least at first glance. Unfamiliar ponies of all four tribes hurried about the room, bringing papers and folders with them as they discussed ideas and drew up revisions. The Princess saw her sister close to the back, pointing at cities on the east coast to two thestrals nearby. Her usually graceful ethereal mane was frazzled; two empty pots of coffee had been put aside at the end of the table.\n\n"Luna, what is going on?" Celestia asked as she navigated through the room towards her. "Has something happened? Is Equestria in danger?"\n\n"Of course not, sister," Luna answered, though Celestia noted that her voice sounded unusually tired yet energetic at the same time. "You told me that you always find other capable ponies to help you. So have I now! These volunteers are aiding me in rallying all the tribes to accept the thestrals as siblings, and for thestrals to rejoin Equestria again!" She gulped leftover coffee directly from the pot.\n\nA white unicorn mare came up from behind the alicorn and approached Luna, one the Princess of the Sun finally recognized. "Luna, darling," Rarity began,  "do you know anyplace I could find any traditionally thestral designs?" Luna hooved over an ancient book with a recent coffee stain from somewhere below the table. Rarity snagged it in her magic and turned, finally noticing who was standing nearby. "Oh, please excuse me, Princess Celestia. I've just been caught up in making a new dress for your sister."\n\nCelestia blinked before refocusing on Luna, who had gone back to looking at papers. "Sister, when you told me of your efforts this wasn't quite what I had in mind," she said delicately, getting the diarch's attention immediately. "Do you need help?"\n\n"But I have plenty of help, sister," Luna protested. Her eyes suddenly turned desperate. "Have I done something wrong?"\n\nCelestia paused. She still remembered that time in the study, when Luna had a similar look asking her to do this on her own. It would be so easy to fix this, to send Rarity and the others back home to manage things like she always had. Canterlot had not been built for this, and Celestia worried about what might happen if things got out of hoof. She could be the big sister Luna had needed over a thousand years ago.\n\n...But should she?"

In terms of setting everything up, it could not have gone better.\n\nThe same, however, could not be said for deciding when to hold it.\n\n"Darling, surely you understand that the more ponies see and hear of our rally, the better?" Rarity pointed out as she and the other organizers entered what Luna felt like the sixth hour of arguing. "Holding it in the middle of the night only says we don't care to have ponies listen, and we simply cannot ask them to ruin their sleep schedules just for us."\n\n"Exactly!" a thestral on the other side of the table fired back. "So why ask the thestrals here to stay up all day for it? We're doing this for them, so the Princess' speech should be at a time they can easily hear it!"\n\n"Optics, dear. We want ponies to remember what we do here, and it's quite hard to see anything memorable in the dead of night. This is for all of Equestria and not just Fillydelphia, remember?"\n\n"We don't care about what our Princess looks like, we care about what she says!" The thestral turned to Luna expectantly, followed by Rarity and then the entire room of ponies. "Princess Luna, what do you think? You're the one leading the rally, after all."\n\nThe alicorn took a step back as they all waited for her response. "I, um, well..." Luna cleared her throat. Confidence was what she needed.

Papers were organized in neat piles, the coffee machines had their own station, and Rarity had been given her own little corner for designing and sketching. Public support for the rallies was rising all across Equestria ever since the success at Fillydelphia, and things were looking up. Luna hoped brightened moods would prevent any more arguments from breaking out for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThat... wasn't exactly turning out to be the case.\n\n"Luna! Luna, darling!" Rarity hurried to the Princess, who had been discussing the next rally with a pair of thestrals. "We have to go to Bridlepolis this week! My dear friend Fancy Pants just informed me that all of the mayors on the east coast are gathering there for a meeting, and courting their support is very important to getting real change done."\n\n"Absolutely not," one of the thestrals responded before Luna could formulate an answer. "Our visit to Hollow Shades is planned for this week. We aren't just canceling a rally at the largest thestral city outside the southeast."\n\n"Well, can't we just move Hollow Shades to some other time?"\n\nThe other thestral sighed before grabbing a clipboard from a nearby table and hoofing it over to Rarity. "We've already set up the entire schedule up to the last rally in Manehattan. We can't just move the trip to some other time, and we aren't going to Bridlepolis just because some Canterlot friend of yours told us to!"\n\n"I do not recall asking you to speak for me," Luna interrupted, earning folded ears from both thestrals. "Hollow Shades is important, but my sister has sought Sir Pants' counsel many times. If he claims this meeting is important, there must be truth to it."\n\n"And Hollow Shades is already very supportive of you," Rarity added to the glares of the thestrals.

Now, what were we discussing?"\n\n"The Wonderbolts, darling. My friend Rainbow Dash has convinced Captain Spitfire to coordinate with us at our rally in Stratusburg next week. I was hoping that we could send her an overview of our rally so that they know what to practice around-"\n\nThe door slammed open, and a familiar thestral rushed into the room. "Princess, we have to cancel the trip to Stratusburg!" he shouted, eliciting a very unrefined frown from Rarity. "Luna Nova is putting together an event and want you there to give another speech. They even have a few moonspeakers from Ayacachtli present!"\n\n"And the Wonderbolts?" Rarity reminded. "What are we supposed to tell them?"\n\n"Tell them we don't need their show anymore," the thestral said back dismissively. "They get enough attention as it is. Who cares if they don't get another chance to take the spotlight?"\n\nRarity's normally composed mask of emotions briefly fractured into rage. "I may not be the Element of Honesty," she downright seethed, "but my friend is doing this because I asked, not for attention. Can your moonspeakers say the same?" The thestral bared his fangs in anger.\n\n"THAT'S ENOUGH!" Everypony stepped back, tails between their legs as Luna's Royal Canterlot Voice shook the room. "I will not have you behaving like foals over this! These rallies are meant to bring unity, something you two have forgotten in these petty arguments!"\n\nDead silence. For a moment, Luna thought she might have gone too far. Rarity's ears were tucked in, but she slowly walked forward and offered her hoof. "My apologies," she started, "I suppose I got so caught up in things I forgot we're all supposed to be in this together. If we are going to Luna Nova, I will of course do my best to make sure the transition is flawless."\n\nThe thestral shook the unicorn's hoof.

"Have you found something about the changelings or Stalliongrad?"\n\n"This is about your sister and her rallies."\n\nThe mention of Luna immediately snapped the alicorn to attention. Sweetie Drops dug through her desk and pulled out a folder labeled 'Project Moonshine', sliding it across to Celestia before continuing. "You won't find many answers in there, but something isn't right with this. Everywhere Princess Luna holds one of her events, it's followed by unexplained changes in staffing at key locations. Military facilities, administrative positions, even my own agents have been failing to report in. I don't like it."\n\nCelestia's eyes grew darker as she leafed through the file. "I don't recall asking you to spy on Luna." Even her favorite coffee brands had been noted. "Are you implying something about my sister?"\n\n"I imply nothing," the director responded flatly. "Luna's campaign is the biggest political shake-up since her return. We'd be fools not to watch it closely. There's no evidence of the bugs or reds, so I suspect a third party is at play. Given how quickly Princess Luna put together her staff, they likely have agents embedded within her campaign advisors."\n\nAny anger Celestia held dissipated quickly, replaced by a seeping fear. "What can we do? Is my sister in danger?"\n\nSweetie Drops shrugged. "Possibly. All we know is that they have something planned for her, and it's all connected to this 'Project Moonshine'. We're in the dark here and these ponies have the upper hoof on us. I'd need to run a full investigation on Luna's staff to shine some light on what's going on. Cancel everything."\n\n"Even if you're right..." Celestia swallowed a lump in her throat. "This will set back integration for years. Thestrals will never trust us.

A rogue state in Zebrica, pulling the strings in an attempt to force the Nightmare's return... using its old host.\n\nThere was no time to waste.

Rarity and the campaign advisors deemed safe by Director Drops were in Manehattan attempting to mitigate the worst of it, but it was an uphill battle without Luna.\n\nAnd the Princess of the Night...\n\nPrincess Celestia paced anxiously in her room, the letter from Sweetie Drops still open on her desk. She had not seen her sister yet, but Luna was supposed to arrive back in Canterlot within the next few days under tight protective guard. But she was unresponsive, ever since the plot had been uncovered. Her previous confidence gone, replaced with a despair Celestia could not imagine. She never should have let her sister take on this burden alone. Now Equestria was on a knife's edge, and she was closer to losing Luna than ever before.\n\nHer advisors had assured her that everything would turn out alright. That within the week, Equestria would return to relative normalcy and Luna would be able to finally finish her movement. But as the clock ticked closer to midnight, Celestia only felt a sense of dread wash over her."

The train had arrived a few hours ago, and she had been safely escorted to the palace, avoiding the small protest of thestrals in the palace courtyard. She had nodded when Celestia said everything was going to be alright. But Luna's spirit was nowhere to be seen. Her movements were slow. She rarely spoke, and only followed in her sister's shadow through the halls of the palace.\n\nSo when Luna paused at one of the stained glass windows to look up at it, illuminated by moonlight. Celestia paused as well. It was one depicting the defeat of the Nightmare by the Element Bearers. "Come now Luna, you need sleep," the elder sister gently pressed. "There's no need to dwell on the past right now."\n\n"...Is this all I am meant to be, sister?" The Princess of the Night's attention remained fixated on the image of her alter-ego. "I wanted to lead like you, to find my own place in Equestria, only to be used by others anyway. I cannot even save my own thestrals without becoming a tool to destroy you. Are we destined to fight no matter what we try?"\n\n"No," Celestia shook her head and stepped forward with wing outstretched. The moasic exploded, glass spraying across the hall as Celestia used her wing to shield her muzzle in reflex. An explosion rocked the palace, smoke and flames climbing high from the courtyard beyond the shattered window. The screams came next. Celestia lowered her wing to check on her sister.\n\nLuna turned to look at Celestia with weeping slit pupils. "Yes."\n\nDarkness and shadows began pulling at the air. Celestia did not need time to understand what it meant; she rushed forward, pulling Luna into a tight embrace even as she grew taller and her coat darkened. "Please..." she whispered as tears began to fall, "...don't leave me again. I'm sorry you have to pay for my mistakes. I love you, Luna."\n\nThe shadows seemed to recede for a moment, and Luna - Nightmare Moon stiffly returned the hug with a single foreleg. "Oh, sister," came the gentle, archaic reply, "We love you too. But it is far too late for both of us."\n\nA wave of darkness blasted Celestia back across the room, slamming her into the wall hard enough to crack stone. Her vision blurring, she watched as her sister took one last look at her before flying off through the broken window. Celestia could only watch the full moon rising in front of her, remembering that fateful day over a thousand years prior. She had told Luna that it was her duty to lower the moon. That she would not fight her.\n\nCelestia had lied twice that night."

In the palace itself, the understaffed administration scrambles to muster a response and mobilize Equestria against the new threat, while the Princess locks herself away behind closed doors to mourn again.\n\nIn the east, the Nightmare rules with an iron hoof in Manehattan against her sister. With the help of the Chiropterrans, who have finally come out of the shadows to wage their war a millennium in the making, thousands of ponies have armed themselves to overthrow the Sun Princess and the west, marching on Canterlot, Bales, Whinnyapolis and beyond. Despite the rushed nature of the plot due to the efforts of S.M.I.L.E. and their failed attempts at infiltration, many believe that the might of the newly proclaimed Lunar Empire will quickly crush the former bastion of Harmony.\n\nEquestria is divided, and the cracks grow larger by the day.

War had been unthinkable for centuries, and the mere thought of pony killing pony - Twilight didn't want to think about it.\n\nLooking around, she recognized quite a few ponies at the table. Prince Blueblood and Fancy Pants, both looking completely exhausted. Raven Inkwell, fiercely scribbling down notes on a sheet of paper as if it could be the difference between life and death. And all of her friends, all her fellow Element Bearers... except one. "Where's Rarity?" Twilight asked. "She's coming, right?"\n\n"I was just getting to that, Princess Twilight," Blueblood said, his voice as ragged as his appearance. "The Nightmare has caught us at a severe disadvantage, as it is clear they have been preparing for this. It will take time to get Equestria in a state where we can push back, time we do not have. And as for the Element of Generosity, Miss Rarity..." the Prince trailed off for a moment. "She has been captured by the Nightmare in Manehattan."\n\nTwilight and her friends all gasped in shock and horror, but Blueblood lifted a hoof to quiet them. "Rarity is fine," he continued. "We know she is being safely held prisoner, and that does not seem like it will change soon. However, it does mean that you all will be unable to use your Elements of Harmony. The only way to end this war will be by force of arms, regrettable as it may be."\n\n"Wait, where's Princess Celestia?" Everypony looked towards Fluttershy, who seemed to sink a bit further into her chair. "Shouldn't she, um, be here to hear all this?"\n\nTwilight and Blueblood shared an uncomfortable glance. They both knew where she was; it was hard not to hear the broken sobs every time they walked past her chambers. But the door remained locked and the two guards never allowed entry, though neither would ever look Princess Twilight in the eyes. To do so would force everypony to face the truth, the reality of what the situation was.\n\nCelestia was gone, and nopony knew when she could come out again... or if she ever would."

What is surprising, however, is that they are being supported by a wide array of mercenaries, hired by none other than the formerly fictional character, Doctor Caballeron.

She had been the best in Ponyville until Princess Twilight arrived, after all, and had served as the leader of Ponyville's animal team for Winter Wrap for years. She had led the evacuation of Ponyville when the civil war began, ensuring friends and family made it to safety from the encroaching forces of Nightmare Moon. In Canterlot's perspective, she was the perfect fit to work as a factory organizer.\n\nShe absolutely hated it.\n\nThere were quotas to meet now, workers to keep track of, quality measures to be followed. A few months ago she had never even seen a rifle; now Amethyst was in charge of producing dozens. Out in the middle of western Equestria, working in a dreary factory with strangers she had never met before.\n\nThe door opened and Amethyst looked up as an exhausted mare stumbled in. Well, maybe not all strangers. "What's wrong, Roseluck? Lunch isn't for another half-hour."\n\n"I can't do this anymore." The unicorn frowned as Roseluck sat down opposite her and laid her head on the desk. "I'm a florist, not a factory worker. My cutie mark told me to sell flowers in Ponyville.

The mare lifted her head and gestured at one of the charts on the wall. It was Amethyst's graph of factory productivity; the line was slowly drifting downwards towards the quota marker below it. "I drop springs, I put hammers in backwards. It feels like I slow everypony else down. I miss my garden, my friends, Ponyville. I miss how Equestria used to be."\n\nPausing for a moment, Amethyst Star slowly put a hoof on Roseluck's. "I've had seven ponies earlier this week come in and tell me the same thing," she gently whickered, causing the florist to look up in surprise. "We're all having trouble with this. I'm sure Lily and and Daisy are somewhere feeling the exact same way. But things can't go back to they were before, not yet. Ponyville, Equestria, it's all in danger, and we have to do this if we want to go home." The unicorn's horn glowed, and window blinds nearby raised themselves to reveal a bright morning outside.

That included filing through all the reports the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them painted a bleak picture.\n\nIt was a complete mess. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was clear he couldn't lead and reform the entire Equestrian Army on his own. There just weren't enough capable officers to lead the ponies willing to fight, causing chaos throughout all levels of the military. Blueblood would never admit it, but he needed somepony that could take the strain off of him from the top. But who in Equestria was capable of doing that? Twilight couldn't do it herself; her knowledge of warfare was strictly academic, and the palace staff needed her elsewhere without Celestia...\n\nTwilight's head snapped up. There was somepony... or rather, somebody who might be able to help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. But it was the only pony Twilight could think of that might be able to handle what was needed.\n\n"Spike!" Twilight called out, waiting until her assistant hurried into the room.

It had been some trouble to keep the machinery installed on top of it intact, but she was fairly certain nothing had been damaged. What was more worrying was the lack of response from the journal. She was usually more punctual than this...\n\nThe surface of the mirror rippled, an amber unicorn on two legs wobbling out. "Twilight!" Sunset Shimmer said, flailing her forelegs before blinking and lowering herself to all fours. "Feels like it's been forever since the last time we've seen each other." She rushed forward and wrapped the alicorn in a crushing hug.\n\n"Well, the last time we saw each other you were leading an entire school's worth of ponies back through the portal," Twilight remarked.

Right now, we need your help stopping Nightmare Moon from taking over Equestria."\n\nSunset nodded. Twilight always wondered how she managed to absorb things so fast. It was a lot better than her own five minutes of worry when she had first heard the news. "Alright, what do you need me to do?"\n\n"Have you ever tried leading an army before?"\n\nSunset's horn sparked while her eyes turned cold."

Now there was nothing but quiet, though the Night Guard whispered of choking and begging for her sister to come back in the late hours long past sundown. Still the door remained closed, locked to all except the bare minimum of palace staff who left her meals.\n\nSunset Shimmer's hooves shook as she stared at the door in front of her. Long ago, she had never hesitated to open it in search of answers to her many questions. Now, it felt like an insurmountable task to even touch the handle. "Maybe we should just go instead," she said quietly, all of her usual confidence gone. "Maybe she just needs a little more time."\n\n"Time is something we do not have, Miss Shimmer," Prince Blueblood reminded her. "We both have our duties to Equestria, and we cannot fulfill them under the circumstances. This is something we must do."\n\n"Easy for you to say, you're not the one asking her to open the door," Sunset grumbled back. Her hoof hesitated inches from the door, but she finally gave it two quiet knocks. "Princess Celestia? It's me, Sunset. Blueblood is here too, and... can we come in?"\n\nNo response. Between the solemn guards flanking the door and the silence, Sunset felt like a powerless filly again. Defeated, she turned to leave before the faint sound of a lock disengaging reached her ears.

Her ethereal mane was unkept, her usually pristine fur stained with tear marks. She was not wearing her golden shoes, peytral or tiara, and when she turned to look at Sunset and Blueblood her eyes were hollow. Broken. Tired.\n\n"It is good to see you again, Sunset," Celestia said, her voice absent any warmth or energy. "And you, nephew. I apologize for my absence."\n\n"Think nothing of it," Blueblood responded, waving a hoof. "You of all ponies have earned the right to mourn. However, I am afraid Miss Shimmer and I have come for more than just pleasantries."\n\nSunset nodded and stepped forward. "Celestia, Blueblood and I have been doing our best to manage Equestria but it's not enough. Ponies just aren't ready to fight Nightmare Moon, and we don't have the power to change that.

"I have faith in both of you to lead Equestria well with Princess Twilight. Should you need my aid in anything, I will do what I can."\n\n"I won't let you down, Celestia." Turning to leave with newfound determination on her muzzle, Sunset did not notice the Princess' wings sag to the floor. Blueblood did, pausing at the door.\n\n"Nephew?" Celestia turned back to her sun. "I... I am not ready to face Equestria yet. I cannot fight Luna again. If you need me I will be there, but..."\n\nBlueblood nodded. "Get some rest, Auntie.

"What, can't I come and visit a friend from Ponyville?" she responded, feigning hurt. "When I heard you were managing a factory here I knew I just had to say hello sometime. Bon Bon wanted to come, but she's very busy. Troops need candy to keep their energy up!" Lyra's eyes caught the productivity chart on the wall. The line was slowly evening out, probably too slowly for Canterlot. "Speaking of the factory, though, it's really nice. All your benches are very comfortable, and all the workers had nothing but nice things to say about you!"\n\nAmethyst paused. "You were asking them about me?"\n\n"Well, yeah," Lyra shrugged. "I didn't want to come visit if you were acting all moody or something. Between you and me, you used to get really bossy whenever you got angry. Did you hypnotize all these ponies, or did you just get really good at managing emotions?"\n\nAmethyst rolled her eyes. "Well, for the first few weeks I was too tired to get angry at anypony," she admitted as Lyra listened carefully. "But everypony here was having a hard time adjusting to this. What they needed was time and somepony to talk to, not an organizer yelling at them to go faster. Nopony wants to be here, but if we're all friends everything is a lot easier."\n\n"Sounds like something Princess Twilight would say," Lyra remarked as she smiled. "Well, it looks like you're doing a really good job here! I'm really proud of you, Amethyst." She idly checked her watch as it beeped, which made Amethyst blink with surprise - since when did Lyra have a watch? "Oops, if I stay any longer Bon Bon's going to get really mad at me. Nice seeing you again!"\n\n"You too, Lyra." As the mint unicorn got up, Amethyst's eyes narrowed. "Wait, how did you know I worked here in the first place?"\n\nLyra paused at the door, giving a strange smile back. "A friend told me!" she said brightly.

Still, as he put the finishing touches on his proposal, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at the efficiency that would come from his ideas...\n\n"Dad?

But with hard won experience they were slowly shaping up, and perhaps they would soon meet the expectations of their forebears.\n\n"Captain Magnus?" A guardsmare walked in, saluting as she entered. "Marshal Clear Skies reporting in. There's been an issue with the guard posting in the west."\n\nFlash frowned. The west was mostly slim garrisons of the guard, mainly for the protection of communities from monster attacks. "Anything serious?" he asked. "Our resources are stretched thin as it is."\n\n"I understand, sir. There's been sporadic cases of public disorder in the rural west. Some of it is believed to be incited by enemy infiltration, taking advantage of local fear and doubt in the absence of Princess Celestia. The unrest is making it difficult to enforce the peace on a wider scale."\n\n"Isn't that S.M.I.L.E.'s job?"\n\nThe mare nodded, placing a report with the agency's seal on it on Flash's desk.

We are more than happy to raise a few spirits with music."\n\nVinyl nodded in between adjusting the knobs and dials on a speaker set. "Well, we all certainly still appreciate it," Mayor Mare said.

Do you have any preference on what sort of style Vinyl and I should play in?"\n\n"I beg your pardon?"\n\n"Music is filled with emotions, mayor," Octavia patiently explained. "It is not just pleasant to listen to, it also makes ponies feel what the musician is feeling. A slow piece can calm." She demonstrated by playing a long, smooth note which made Mayor Mare instinctively relax. "Meanwhile, a fast and sharp piece..." Octavia followed up with a series of short intense notes, the mayor instantly more alert. "Do you understand?"\n\n"I suppose... but what do you think is best?"\n\nOctavia shrugged, putting her cello aside. "As you said, these ponies are anxious and despondent. Something soft and soothing could ease their fears and sorrows, bring hope for a brighter future." Vinyl waved a hoof, and the cellist sighed. "Or yes, we could do something fast and daring. Get them inspired and angry, ready to fight back against the Nightmare. Vinyl prefers that sort of thing. But we can't do both." She pointed her bow at Mayor Mare.

They had very different expectations with much less knowledge of bureaucracy and paperwork. Blueblood was at least familiar with the old system, but Shimmer was far too impatient for Raven's liking. Equestria had been unbearably slow in reforming itself, yes, but it was methodical, careful, precise. She demanded immediate responses to problems that were simply impossible to solve in a day. Sunset was a military commander first, and a political leader somewhere around fifteenth.\n\nUnfortunately, those two things were slowly becoming one and the same.\n\n"Miss Inkwell?" Raven looked up to see Prince Blueblood walk in, sitting down across from her. "I understand Miss Shimmer has requested a tighter military integration into the administration. May I assume you have already received it?"\n\n"I have," the mare confirmed. "Military commanders at almost every level of governance, working alongside civil administrators to coordinate wartime efforts. It was quite... extensive, if nothing else."\n\n"Yes, Shimmer is nothing if not extensive when it comes to matters like this. May I ask your thoughts on it?"\n\nFiling away another folder, Raven put down her quill and thought for a moment. "There is certainly room for military advice and practicality," she admitted as Blueblood listened. "Ponies like Fizzlepop Berrytwist and Maudileena Pie are proving themselves well. However, I have worries on what may result on lower levels of administration, especially with ponies who may have been radicalized. And all that aside, a reform of this scale would certainly require Princess Celestia's involvement to be successful."\n\n"I do not believe it wise to involve the Princess." Blueblood gauged the secretary carefully. "She is not well. The military government is meant to be a stopgap, not a method to force her into approving our decisions."\n\nRaven eyed her stack of paperwork. "Shimmer has a point."\n\nBlueblood stood up to leave.

The Lunarists loved night raids, whinnying their keening war cry from the forests to spook the newer soldiers. For the earth pony, however, the sound just reminded him of the roar from the Whinnyapolis crowd. He skidded to a perfect stop beside a machine gun along the forward line. Like the past two times, he was ahead of the herd. Fast slung down the boxes and turned tail.\n\n"My loader’s down!" The gunner was also an earth pony, and something in his voice sounded familiar. Fast pivoted back to the gun and rammed the empty belt aside. He tried to ignore the body crumpled a few hooves away. The gunner nodded purple eyes framed by greasepaint and a heavy helmet. "Thanks, Fast. Get down."\n\nFast Ball ducked, ears pinning at the burst of gunfire ripping from the barrel. He blinked upwards at the strangely familiar pony. In his mind, suddenly the muzzle flashes were camera bulbs and the uniform was a lighter green jersey. "Short Stop!?"\n\nRiverpool’s best buckball kicker glanced down at his Whinnyapolis rival. "Different helmet, huh?" Short laid off the trigger to let the gun cool. The other machine guns opened up into the forest from the other pits. "Only recognized your hustle. How’s the rest of the team?"\n\nFast helped swivel the tripod into a new position along the sandbags. "I... don’t know. Around. They split us up." Another war cry echoed and he tried to laugh. "Why? You want a rematch? We’re out of season."\n\n"Ref was distracted," Short snorted, using the same excuse he claimed during the game. He still smiled as a bullet ripped through a nearby sandbag. "You’re on. I’ll scrounge the Riverpool Warriors up if we survive tonight." He reared back onto the gun.\n\n"When we survive tonight," Fast smirked, "Whinnyapolis’ll thrash your tails again.""

"It's about the thestrals. Marshal Shimmer wants us to form a special group of them to work night operations, integrate them with our frontline divisions. Wants us to run a campaign encouraging them to apply."\n\nThe Wonderbolt Captain shrugged, opening the folder and giving it a cursory glance. "Sounds fine to me," she responded, tossing it back to Soarin. "What's the problem?"\n\n"The cadets. Most joined at the war's start. They want nothing to do with thestrals.

Zebrica was not Equestria, but the core idea remained the same. You were either broken by war or tempered by it, finding the strength and determination to fight back when confronted with reality. War weeded out the weak-willed creatures that Tempest once believed filled Equestria before Twilight brought her home.\n\nHowever, war also easily brought out the worst in those lacking discipline and self-control. And as Fizzlepop Berrytwist watched the newest group of recruits for the Equestrian army, a horrifying sense of familiarity began to seep in.\n\n"I checked their reports," Grubber said as he waddled over, files in claw. "These ponies have super high marks. Like I'm talking top of the mountain high, definitely not just normal Equestrians. They'd probably be super effective."\n\n"Did you watch them during training as well?"\n\nThe hedgehog nodded. "They really hate those bats. Like, I was listening in on a talk they were having and all I heard was stuff like 'I can't wait to finally kill some traitors' and 'they'll all pay for betraying Celestia' and that kind of thing."\n\nFizzlepop frowned. Her task was to win the war, given by Sunset herself. Equestria needed more ponypower, more soldiers, and these were badly needed recruits. But this, this was the first time she didn't want to send a group off to the front.\n\n"Uh, Fizzlepop? Can I say something else?" The unicorn raised an eyebrow but motioned for Grubber to continue. "This isn't a good idea. I know how much you hate talking about when you were Commander Tempest, but you gotta admit we were really good at trying to follow your orders. These guys, they don't seem like that. They're gonna do what they want no matter what you say, and something tells me other ponies aren't gonna like what they do."\n\nGrubber could be very observant, when he wanted to be.

And yet the Nightmare remained, personally leading a last strike upon the capital with her fanatics in a desperate bid to take the throne.\n\nShe was the only survivor. Nightmare Moon's armor was shattered, her blood stained the carpet beneath her hooves, and yet the dead royal guards surrounding her remained a testament to her power and fury. The only thing standing between her and the throne room was Princess Twilight Sparkle, hooves shaking behind a weak shield. This time there would be no trickery, no Elements.

"Please, Luna," she said, her voice thick with grief. "Don't do this. It is over."\n\n"It is not over!" Nightmare Moon snarled.

"I will do what I must."\n\nThe Nightmare laughed again at the parody of determination before her. "Spare me your acting," she said, continuing to advance upon teacher and student.

A heavy burden, one with hardship and struggle that many ponies couldn't understand. To smile, wave and lead, to build Equestria anew waiting for a sister forgotten, the mistakes of the past eternally weighing heavy with every choice she made. How had things gone so wrong again? How did she lose Luna so soon?\n\nThe blame was hers. She had grown too complacent, too trusting, too lax. Memories rushed through Celestia's mind. Watching Sunset Shimmer leave, unable to save her from her own ambition. The Severyanian ponies, forced to rebel after years of oppression. Laying powerless at the hooves of Chrysalis as Canterlot fell. And finally Luna, looking at her with hope and determination as she spoke of the thestrals, falling victim to a failing Celestia had never fixed. How could she have been so blind?\n\nCelestia had always believed there was time. She was immortal, after all. She could wait for change, for heroes to rise, for ponies to become better and see the error of their own ways. But how many suffered while she waited? How many ponies had died in a war of her own making? No longer. No more.\n\nSo much still needed to be done. Nightmare Moon had broken Equestria in far more than two, and shadows circled the pieces.

None of us are happy, and I swear I saw Spitfire throw a chair after ordering a new memorial for the Academy. But you can't let it get to you like this. So what if you can't do a sonic rainboom - you're still the fastest 'bolt in-"\n\nRainbow slashed through the last mango so hard the fruit exploded. "You don't get it!" she finally shouted, waving her metal wing around. "You weren't there! I still have nightmares about waking up in that medical tent and seeing what was left of my wing before the docs put me under again, and I don't even know if Nightmare Moon is doing that or not! Do you know how hard it is having to listen to ponies say 'oh, they're Equestrians too'?"\n\nFleetfoot flinched as Rainbow fixed her with a baleful glare. "They aren't." After a few seconds, the prismatic pegasus huffed. "I'm heading back to HQ," she said as she readied herself into flight position. "If you want to help, win this stupid war.

The sign at the front, the white fences, the chicken coup, all of it was still there. But the farmstead itself had been transformed into a factory complete with smokestacks, a water tower and conveyor belts raking across the rows of trees. Apples were fed into industrial vats that spit out something resembling apple sauce into metal cans, which were quickly packaged in wooden crates. Countless unfamiliar ponies trotted about in uniform, working to make up for the loss of one particular pony.\n\n"Ain't right, Applejack," Granny Smith complained as she looked out the window. "The sky's not supposed to be that grey. Must be those towers with all that smoke."\n\n"It's nothing that pegasi can't get rid of later," Applejack dismissed as she finished inspecting one of the conveyor lines.\n\n"This is different, I can feel it. We've run this farm for years upon years the same way, and now we've gone and changed everything. Breaking our traditions, why it's no wonder things went wrong."\n\nApplejack didn't look back. "Granny, we didn't have any choice," she responded, struggling to keep her voice level. "You saw what happened when those ponies came out of the Everfree. Nightmare Moon won't leave us with anything if she wins. At least we still have a farm - plenty of family died defending theirs."\n\n"Ain't worth having a farm when it's like this. What do we have left?"\n\n"Family." Granny Smith's ears pinned back as Big Macintosh walked up, getting between the two mares. "Come on, Granny. Applejack needs to check the lines."\n\nAs her family slowly trotted away, the last farmpony tilted her hat downwards. She had seen the reports, read the orders. Applejack was no student in fancy mathematics, but she still understood that there was no choice. Ponies on the front needed these rations, and everypony else needed to sacrifice what was necessary. Applejack understood that.\n\nAnd yet, a single tear trailed down her muzzle."

The massive stack of notecards on her desk proved as much. And the relentless knocking at the door before dawn.\n\n"You can come in," Twilight called out as she assigned talking points to little pictures of little ponies. The next week was a flurry of meetings with mayors about concerns with the war effort, so many that she was having a difficult time keeping track. Mayor Goldwin was Vanhoover, right?

Finally, Raven moved forward and offered the Princess a hoofkerchief. "I apologize," she said as Twilight used it to wipe her tears. "It has been difficult on all of us to adapt to Celestia's absence. It's unfair to put that weight on you instead." The unicorn thought for a moment.

"While my guards were certainly nice, being kept in a room for Celestia knows how long does wear on a pony."\n\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes. "Yeah, 'nice'.

Perhaps the country ponies, those with farms tending to their crops and animals at the crack of dawn would say otherwise, but the capital of Equestria preferred to tackle days with rested minds.\n\nFor Raven Inkwell and Fancy Pants, it was a time far too late to start their day. They were already hard at work in the palace when the clocks rung seven. Fancy still preferred his morning tea, while Raven had switched to double-shot coffee a long time ago. Both of them had large stacks of papers piled on their desks, reports and applications and every kind of paperwork imaginable.\n\n"I say, your work didn't seem quite as difficult as it actually is," Fancy commented as he signed another page with a quill and put it aside. "Has it always been this tedious?"\n\nRaven stamped another file with the royal seal. "Yes, but there was never this much to deal with," she replied, keeping her focus on the task at hoof. "Cities used to run themselves. Now that the Princess wants regular reports from all across Equestria sent to Canterlot for review, I have to deal with those while reviewing all the new candidates for the bureaucracy."\n\n"So she gave you that task as well. I am very busy looking at which of my peers may still be of use to the Princess. Unfortunately many only desired the status and social events of Canterlot, making them rather... uncooperative."\n\n"I didn't know they ever weren't." Reaching the last paper in her latest stack, Raven took off her glasses and rubbed her eyes before sighing. "Fancy, I know we haven't seen eye to eye on a lot. And I really don't care about the Princess ending all those galas and ceremonies like you do. But neither of us can do this alone. If you know some ponies good at management or organizing, I can make sure they still have a place in Canterlot."\n\nIt took a moment for the socialite to put down his quill and take off his monocle. His eyes were just as weary as Raven's. "I suppose there are a few I know who could be of use to you," he admitted. "Perhaps it is time to put the past behind us.

Fortunately, there had been many qualified ponies around willing to substitute in, and Starlight Glimmer was more than ready to become the new Headmare. With Trixie taking Starlight's place as guidance counselor and Octavia Melody volunteering as a temporary Vice-Headmare, Twilight had full confidence in their ability to manage the school in her absence.\n\n...That didn't mean she couldn't still worry about things, though.\n\n"Are you sure you have everything ready for them?" Twilight asked Starlight as the two walked through the empty halls of the school. Class was in session and the students were busy with their new teachers. "It's a big shift, having to cover material for a whole new tribe."\n\n"Yes, Twilight," the headmare sighed. "We already have night classes scheduled for the new thestral students too, just like you suggested. There sure are a lot of them this year. It seems a little weird, considering how they wanted nothing to do with the school before."\n\nTwilight frowned. Before the war, every attempt to get the fourth tribe to participate in the school was met with flat refusal.

No matter what S.M.I.L.E's reports or her gut said, she would accept and work with the bats.\n\nDidn't mean she had to accept all of them. Rainbow dumped a file of a slow flier into the wastebin with her good wing. Her metal wing laid on the table, below a small pile of approvals. A shadow shifted under her door.

Why are you here?"\n\n"To thank you," the Thestral returned simply. "I seek no quarrel. We did the same. If chosen, I will not let you down, One-Winged Warrior." The Thestral saluted again with his wing and pulled his flightsuit closed.\n\nRainbow's muzzle twitched. "Thank me for what?"\n\nThe thestral shrugged. "You could have slit my throat." He left just as quietly as he entered. Rainbow found his file after a moment of silence. They had served on opposite sides in the same sectors, so he probably wasn't lying. Skill wise, he was decent.

"I'm not," she snorted, unleashing a wild fireball which Sunset quickly teleported away from. Any momentary satisfaction at that, however, was quickly cut short when Sunset reappeared at her forelegs with a blazing horn. Celestia's vision filled with sunspots and she stumbled backwards, swinging a wing to bat away the smaller unicorn.

In the story, the three pony tribes, Unicorns, Pegasi and Earth ponies, live an uneasy existence together until a fearsome blizzard forces them to seek for a new homeland. However, the leaders of the tribes all claim the same land and argue with one another, causing the blizzard to appear again. According to the legend, the cold was caused by magical Windigos that feed on hatred. The tribal leaders are frozen in ice, but their assistants befriend one another and create the Fire of Friendship, a heart-shaped flame that expels the Windigos forever and melts the bodies and hearts of the tribal leaders. The three tribes then agree to share the new land, calling it Equestria. After the pageants, on Hearth's Warming Day, pony families enjoy delicious meals, exchange gifts and raise the flag of Equestria.\n\nAnd now, the new year has come. Everypony on the streets are sharing an optimistic view on the future and wishing all strangers a happy new year, because nobody is actually a stranger in Equestria.

Had she known the time and danger involved in the trip, she probably wouldn't have volunteered to lead the expedition in the first place. She was pretty sure at least five years of her lifespan were gone from those avalanches.\n\nPrince Rutherford looked from the military equipment to Frosty; he had arrived to personally oversee the transfer. "Yaks appreciate pony help!" he said loudly, as was the norm for all yaks. "Yaks and ponies live in dangerous times!

"Equestria will always stand by our friends, and we know how important it is to help you as much as we can."\n\nThere was a crash. A few ponies had dropped one of the crates, letting rifles spill out from the top. The Prince picked one of them up and studied it closely. "This pony weapon, not yak made," he said, anger slowly rising. "Pony weapons not for yaks, not perfect. When things not perfect, make yaks mad! Makes yaks want to destroy!"\n\nThe pony winced.

But no more is that the case. The cash injection that has been performed by the Crown has been immensely helpful in broadening the appeal and fields of the School for Gifted Unicorns. Having moved most of the facilities from the older, historical, if cramped quarters in the core of Canterlot to a more modernized place in the outskirts of Canterlot, the new sprawling campus will be able to more adequately handle the many breakthroughs and inventions that are being pumped out of Equestria's scientific community. Many of the new students and faculty have been some of Griffonia's brightest that have fled the political turmoil in Wingbardy and some parts of the Empire for more fertile lands. They have certainly found them here in Equestria."
 #equestria.4.d_sol:0 "In the past, it was all too often of an occurrence, that those of rich families simply used their family wealth to buy their foal a place in the school.

This sets an undesirable precedent that our Empress can no longer tolerate. Today Her Imperial Majesty agreed to a proposal to fund the School for Gifted Unicorns from Imperial Treasury directly in form of annual cash injections. These new funds will be used to refurbish classrooms and other school facilities, as well as better equipment and supplies. This also gives the Crown more power and control over the curriculum of the school. Starting this semester, the school will besides be focusing on magic also teach religious and moral values.

Nothing symbolized that seriousness more than the long scroll that had been brought to Prince Rutherford, expertly written in elegant ponish on the finest Equestrian parchment, and already signed by both diarchs of Equestria. There was just one small problem with it.\n\nAlmost no yak could read the exceedingly formal script. Fortunately, an official diplomat had been sent from Canterlot with the entire document already memorized to read aloud to the yaks of Rutherford's court. Unfortunately, Pinkie Pie had also decided to give commentary on the exceedingly formal language of the document, which was a blessing or a curse depending on who you asked in the room.\n\n"...which hereby solidifies cordial relations between the Principality of Equestria and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan in perpetuity, agreed upon by the sovereigns of each nation." The diplomat, an old earth pony stallion with a long grey beard, finally finished his reading of the treaty and bowed to the Prince and his entourage, who all looked to Pinkie Pie standing off to the side.\n\n"What he means is that we all Pinkie Promise to always be super duper friends and help each other out whenever we need it! It also means that I can throw the biggest party in Yakyakistan EVER!" Pinkie was already bouncing up and down at the mere thought of it, while the Prince and the other yaks nodded before looking at each other. Rutherford stomped once - the elders stomped back. They nodded at him - he nodded back.\n\n"Yakyakistan still in difficult time!" he finally proclaimed, causing even Pinkie to stop bouncing and listen attentively. "Many disagreements between yaks, still needs fixing! Yaks believe we need focus on yak issues, not pony issues!"\n\nPinkie frowned, and her mane threatened to deflate like it did during the yovidaphone incident. "PINK PONY NO CRY YET!" Rutherford yelled loud enough to shake the pony's eyeballs around. "Yak never forget friendship. Friendship of pink pony, and all ponyland! When pony call, yak will always answer!" Another yak brought forth an almost comedically large quill, which the Prince used to sign the document before adding his royal seal with a loud slam.\n\nThe excitement in Pinkie's eyes returned faster than the snap of a hoof. "Yay!" she said bouncing all across the room. "Ooh, I'll need to get my super-duper party cannon for this one! Come on, we have a party to throw!" The Equestrian diplomat, who had only nodded politely and had turned to leave found himself dragged faster than the speed of sound out the door by the party pony, the yaks all laughing uproariously at the antics of their old new friend."

 #equestria.5.d:0 "Today, what was once a pipe dream in the minds of the researchers of the Luna Nova Academy has been made reality. Made possible with the massive injection of funds from the Crown, the Luna Nova Academy has moved from its older campus to the newer, more modern magically-powered campus. Housed in the old clocktower outside of Ponyville, the laboratories and study halls stretch deep underground, with several testing areas housed both above and below ground. With the new facilities, several old inventions which had been put in mothballs by lack of funds, facilities or both have been pulled out and begun field testing, and depending on what is chosen at the highest level, may see full-scale deployment within the year.\n\nIt is expected that the institution's patron, HM Princess Luna will make a visit to the place in the very near future."

Lastly, Her Imperial Majesty did not make any demands per se.

equestria.5.t:0 "Arrival of the Exiles"
equestria.5.d:0 "The last time Prince Rutherford had visited Equestria in a manner like this, it had nearly ended with the Kingdom of Yakyakistan declaring war upon Equestria. One could perhaps, if looking for it, find irony in the fact then that he had returned not as a Prince, or as an enemy, but as an exile. Him and thousands of other yaks, all following their former monarch to the first friends they found outside of Yakyakistan. Pinkie Pie had personally requested (or demanded according to some) to accompany the yaks from Whinnyapolis to their destination of Canterlot. Now she stood with an oddly contemplative expression to one side as the Prince stood before Princess Celestia, alone on her throne.\n\n"We are deeply troubled by the news coming out of Yakyakistan," the alicorn said to Rutherford and his entourage consisting of a few elders who had chosen to come with him in exile and the former student of the School of Friendship, Yona. "I wish we only could have done more to help before it was too late. Should you wish to stay, Equestria will welcome you with open hooves for as long as you need."\n\nThe yak nodded in agreement. "Home of yaks fall to evil forces. Ponyland also in danger by same forces! Yaks fight with ponies, make sure not suffer same fate as Yakyakistan!"\n\nYona stepped forward as well, the Prince giving a nod in agreement to allow her to speak. "Maybe yaks return home to Yakyakistan someday, maybe not," she said, her voice laced with just a twinge of bitterness which quickly disappeared. "But yaks never let down pony friends no matter what! Yaks protect Equestria, just like ponies do!"\n\nPinkie looked at Yona and Rutherford for a second before her head turned to see Celestia's response, a single light nod. "Equestria would never refuse help from its friends," she said softly, at least compared to the yaks.\n\n"Good!" Rutherford practically yelled back. "Pony princess have no choice in matter anyway. Exile makes yaks mad, want to SMASH something!" All the yaks barring Yona started stomping the ground as hard as they could, which was thankfully magically reinforced. All the commotion caused the Royal Guards to storm in to see what the noise was, then staring confused at the display of violence against the palace floor.\n\nAnd despite everything, the slightest twinge of a smile tugged at Celestia's muzzle."

The overhaul of the public school system in Equestria has been long overdue, still teaching subjects and topics that have been mentioned as being outdated 'when Coltlumbus made landfall in New Mareland'. Hyperbole, to be sure, but a damning indictment of the state of education nonetheless before our reforms.

Time of the essence, as a war has been judged to be near-forthcoming and if the predictions in the Dotted Line Report are to be avoided, then Equestria must truly take radical and controversial measures to survive the storm ahead.\n\nThree separate lines of development are to be taken.

She was given a heroine's welcome in the city of Vanhoover, the largest Olenian community outside of the Kingdom proper. The city had long been a hotbed for resistance against Johan, both Legitimists favouring the restoration of Queen Velvet and communists favouring a restructuring along the lines of Stalliongrad. Common for both, however, is that she has long been a focal point for resistance against Johan, whatever their creed may be. Of course that is where the similarities end, but that's a matter for another time.\n\nQueen Velvet has settled nicely into Vanhoover, having already begun advocating that Equestria should intervene in Olenia to restore 'rightful rule' to Olenia."

This is an insult to all buffalo!"\n\n"It's not like that at all!" Little Strongheart argued back, shouting above the cries of many buffalo who voiced their dissent. "The ponies are our friends, and they just want to help us! But they can't do that if we keep to ourselves and fight against everything different! Joining Equestria doesn't make us any less of who we are!"\n\nMany more buffalo started talking amongst themselves, seeming to agree with Strongheart's words. "It gets rid of everything we are!" the Elder shot back, outraged. "We would consign ourselves to a future chosen by ponies, not buffalo! They will never have our interests in mind, nor do they care for our traditions. The fact we are even considering this is an affront to all our ancestors!"\n\nThunderhooves grunted in deep contemplation. "The Equestrians have taken much from us already," he said slowly and authoritatively. Many buffalo nearby nodded. "The buffalo have lasted for centuries on our own. We do not need the ponies to solve our issues."\n\n"But we don't need to do everything on our own either," Strongheart pleaded. "Please, understand that this isn't the end for anything we care about.

"Little Strongheart, are you sure that you want to do this? I know that your traditions mean a lot to you, and to all the buffalo. It feels weird to give up all of that now, after everything you did to protect it."\n\nThe buffalo jumped over to Dash, giving a reassuring smile. "Dash, whether we call ourselves Equestrians or not doesn't change who we are. We keep our traditions alive by how we act and what we do, not through keeping ourselves separate from others. Besides, I believe we can learn a lot from pony traditions, just like how you can learn from us!"\n\n"Yeah, but still..." The frown remained plastered on the pegasi's muzzle.\n\n"Dash, friends trust each other, right?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"And we're friends, right?"\n\n"Obviously."\n\n"Then let us trust you to treat our traditions with respect," Strongheart said resolutely.

Celestia did not mind the use of her archaic title; it was one the buffalo had retained for her, even as the centuries passed and it was lost in the minds of others.\n\n"Thank you." The buffalo took a few steps forward, seemingly a bit reluctant to speak at first. "I came here today because I was talking with some of the other buffalo, and we decided that we should do something to defend Equestria too!"\n\nThe princess tilted her head slightly at the sudden outburst. "What do you mean by that?" she asked, more curious than confused.\n\nStrongheart wasted no time in continuing, regaining her confidence as she did so. "We learned years ago that you have to be ready to fight to protect your traditions. Buffalo and ponies may have had differences, but all of us need to work together now to protect them! So please, let us stay here and do our part!"\n\n"But what about your home?" Celestia asked. "Aren't you needed there to lead?"\n\n"Equestria is my home, Day Bringer. And Chief Thunderhooves agreed that I could do more for the buffalo here in Canterlot while he remains chief of the tribes. This is what I want to do."\n\nCelestia gently nodded. "Then of course you can stay here, Little Strongheart." Standing up from her throne, the alicorn walked down to stand in front of the buffalo, her face full of gratitude and kindness.

In the palace itself, whatever staff have remained loyal scramble to muster a response and mobilize Equestria against the new threat, even while the Princess locks herself away behind closed doors.\n\nIn the east, harmony has been replaced with the rule of the Nightmare, who has arrived in Manehattan to lead her armies against her sister. With the help of the Chiropterrans, who have finally come out of the shadows to wage their war over a thousand years in the making, thousands of ponies have armed themselves to overthrow the Sun Princess and the west, marching on Canterlot, Bales, Whinnyapolis and beyond. Despite the early springing of their plot keeping them at a disadvantage, many expect that Equestria will fall quickly against the might of the newly-proclaimed Lunar Empire.\n\nAs the lines are drawn in the dirt, brother goes against brother and Equestria, once the land of friendship and harmony, finds itself split in twain.

Twilight (not you, the Princess Twilight over here) is just trying to keep Equestria from falling apart even more, and whenever I see her she looks even more exhausted then you do whenever you spend an all-nighter making something for the school science fair!\n\nBy the way, how are things going over there? Time works differently across the portal so I'm not entirely sure how long its been for all of you, but I think you girls are all still on break, right? I hope all of you can still enjoy the rest of your time off without me. I'll try to be back as soon as I can, once Equestria is safe and Princess Twilight doesn't need me here anymore. I also made sure to bring the picture Photo Finish took of us at the cornucopia, though I keep it hidden away from everypony else. It would be a bit weird explaining why I have a picture of all of Princess Twilight's friends here.\n\nWell, that's all I've got for now. Make sure to write back to me soon! I want to hear everything going on, especially if any more Equestrian magic gets loose again. (And no, Rainbow Dash, I will not help you cheat on your homework by just giving you the answers.

equestria_celestia.12.d:0 "It was that time again.\n\nPhilomena was sick, a mere shadow of her former self. Her feathers has almost completely fallen off, signaling the end of the cycle. Such was the life of a phoenix; one that Philomena had lived for centuries at Celestia's side. The Princess still remembered that time shortly after Luna's banishment, when she had found a lone phoenix egg while returning from a visit to the dragons. With no parents or other phoenixes to be found Celestia had taken her back to Canterlot, and in turn Philomena became her sole companion over the thousand years she had ruled alone. In many ways they were almost one and the same.\n\nCanterlot had learned better than to make fun of or take advantage of the phoenix while she was frail and weak. Those who did always found themselves on the receiving end of a prank once Philomena had finished her cycle. Sometimes ponies would complain to her, particularly if the form of revenge was mean-spirited, but Celestia had never reprimanded her companion for her actions. After all Philomena knew the limits of what she could get away with, and it was often a good lesson to ponies on how not to take advantage of another creature just because they were vulnerable.\n\n...Equestria was whole again, in a sense. The traitors had been dealt with, and normal life was finally starting to resume in the minds of her subjects. But that was far from the case outside of Equestria's new borders. Creatures would not cease plotting to destroy harmony just because Equestria had won a single war, against her own sister no less. And what was the only way to respond to provocation after provocation?\n\nThe bird in front of Celestia burst into flames, quickly becoming nothing more than a pile of ash. The Princess stood, watching as it trailed up into the air and coalesced into a tornado before a new phoenix burst out in a brilliant display of light. Celestia did not wince or look away; a foreleg extended outwards for Philomena to perch on.\n\nThe phoenix obeyed the silent command. The Equestrian Army was ready for its mission, the ponies ready for their Princess. Equestria had been reborn.\n\nIt was time to rule."

Speaking before tens of thousands of ponies gathered in support of batpony equality, a concealed bomb detonated, severely injuring and killing several members of the audience.\n\nSurviving the blast, Luna held back the dark powers that attempted to overwhelm her. Channeling deep reserves of power, Luna healed the wounded before collapsing.\n\nWith Luna's valiant stand, and near universal outcry at the attack, the Referendum has passed decisively.\n\nBatpony equality is a reality, and Luna stands newly confident as monarch, vowing to realise the dreams of those who believe in her."

 equestria.220.d_1:0 "Silent and Dusk sat enjoying the evening air in Manehattan Central Park. Their daughter Night Blossom squeaked as she flew, eagerly seeking her foal pegasi friends in their aerial game of hide and seek. Eventually they would realise that her hypersensitive hearing gave away their locations even as she covered her eyes and counted to thirty, but until then she was enjoying her reign as Princess of Hide and Seek.\n\nThe real Princess stood at the other end of the park, addressing a crowd. She stood confidently, no longer the mare who stammered her way through a press conference. "...and as we stand here today to celebrate a dream realised, we take a moment's silence to mourn those who lost their lives making it happen." The park quieted, and Luna bowed, ceding the stage to Flowing Current, leader of the newly formed Thestral Reintegration Initiative.\n\nBackstage, Celestia approached Luna, giving her a warm hug in greeting. "When I first stepped back to allow you to lead those reforms, I was so worried! But... I must admit, you've become quite a leader, and even found a talent for dramatic speeches." She winked conspiratorially. "I, on the other hoof, have always been a terrible actor."\n\nLuna laughed. In 1000 years, Celestia hadn't changed a bit. As befitted the eternal Sun, Luna thought. Luna thanked Celestia and left - the world of dreams called once more.\n\nMeanwhile, in a tiny apartment on Manehattan's outskirts, Misty Night sat, glumly cradling her rifle. Princess Luna had triumphed. Her help was not needed. But, she was prepared to wait. One day, Luna would need her once again.\n\nOne day, Nightmare Moon would return. And the Disciples of Nightmare Moon would be ready."

 #CELESTIA+LUNA Reform Adventures - No Civil War events here
 equestria.214.t:0 "The Shadow Market"
 equestria.214.d:0 "During their centuries largely outside outside Equestrian Society, the bat ponies developed their own, parallel society and even economy. Being in many areas unburdened by taxes or Equestrian laws, this economy has established itself in many places across Equestria, allowing them to make sure that any bits they earn remains within bat pony society. Even the wages paid by those thestrals who worked as unregistered labourers in Equestrian industries or farms go into this shadow economy and stay there, and over time entire industries, though small scale, have grown up here. This has become a drain on the Equestrian economy as many of the three tribes have taken to spending their money there instead as well.\n\nMany thestrals take pride in their self-sufficiency, and resent the notion of having to bow to the obligations of the society they never were part of. This sentiment is echoed by several industrialists, who have tied themselves in knots trying argue for the preservation the system without saying outright that they want to be able to get away with not paying proper wages to their workers.\n\nIf the thestrals are to be integrated, this shadow market must be addressed, but the question is how."
 equestria.214.a:0 "Reintegrate them fully, but make sure to help them on the way."
 equestria.214.b:0 "We can make exceptions in some cases."
 equestria.214.c:0 "We should not be forcing this..."

 equestria.215.t:0 "Anti-Thestral Sentiments"
 equestria.215.d:0 "Whilst bat ponies have traditionally been Equestrian citizens, they live apart from the citizens of other races in their own communities.\n\nBut many citizens want it to remain this way. They think that bat ponies do not need to be integrated into society and brought out of isolation. Some are afraid of possible side effects such as a disruption of societal Harmony, others fear the rumoured Nightmare Moon cultists among the ranks of the bat ponies, and a few think they have no place among the other three races of Equestria, seeing them as complete outsiders. To them, it's as if Celestia was suggesting griffons to be welcomed as a Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe Canterlot bureaucracy has prepared an initiative to promote the integration. Groups of bat ponies would be invited to tour across Equestria, so the common citizens could see them with their own eyes. EEA syllabi would be rewritten to teach about bat ponies and their history. False rumours about cultists would be dispelled by official media. Pamphlets and posters would be distributed, showing photographs of smiling thestrals with the words "THESE BAT PONIES ARE OUR FRIENDS".\n\nHowever, if taken too far, pushing this pro-bat pony information can easily be considered propaganda or an attempt at forcibly changing ponies' minds about the matter."
 equestria.215.a:0 "It matters not. They must know the truth."
 equestria.215.b:0 "We could probably tone it down somewhat."
 equestria.215.c:0 "This is enough for now, then."
 
 equestria.216.t:0 "Thestral Mistrust"
 equestria.216.d:0 "Ponies may be skeptical, but the same is true for the thestrals themselves. Many of them don't trust the other Equestrians and only support the integration because Princess Luna is advocating for it. They simply want to be left alone, instead of trying to befriend other ponies.\n\nFortunately, nowhere is more equipped to handle this problem than the land of Friendship. As Princess of Friendship, Twilight Sparkle has drawn up a campaign plan that stretches down the hallway.\n\nThe plan is as inspired and diverse as it is complex and expensive - the Elements of Harmony visiting isolated thestral communities in jungles and mountains; Friendship clubs; inviting thestral students to the School of Friendship; Dusk Festivals where both bat ponies and other ponies would celebrate together; Celestia and Luna meeting with bat pony leaders; and the list goes on..."

 equestria.218.t:0 "The Reforms"
 equestria.218.d_1:0 "Luna cheerfully began her nightly rounds of the palace. She passed offices where bat pony bureaucrats worked through the night, continuing the shifts from their daytime counterparts. Manehattan was often called "The city that never sleeps". Well it had become true here in Canterlot, too.\n\nAcross the nation, thestrals ventured into cities in greater numbers, attracted by employment opportunities and a new attitude of tolerance. The changes would take years, decades even, to be fully felt, but the Equestrian public was now ready to accept bat ponies as the Fourth Tribe, standing ready to protect their new friends from harm.\n\n"It's wonderful, isn't it?"\n\nLuna turned in surprise, to find Celestia regarding her. Luna tried to speak, but instead found herself crying. Celestia had made her dreams real. A thousand years in exile, all because she'd been too proud to ask for help!\n\nCelestia hugged Luna as the blue mare sobbed, cradling Luna in her wings. She would never let Luna down again."
 equestria.218.d_2:0 "Luna stood on a balcony, staring sadly into the night sky. She thought she saw a movement in the darkness - the flap of thestral wings perhaps? It was not uncommon to see them these days. Luna's reverie was interrupted as Celestia joined her, apparently content to stand silently.\n\nLuna spoke first "Celestia. Did we do enough? Many still have not accepted this change. We made so many compromises..."\n\nCelestia stood silent for a minute before speaking. "This is the burden we bear, Luna. You know the threats that are coming. You know the challenges we must balance. This land has stood for over a millennium, and our caution might be what ensures it will stand millennia more."\n\nLuna closed her eyes, trembling.\n\n"I know these changes are not as fast or as bold as you wish. But we have started something with these new ideas about thestrals. Maybe not this year. Maybe not this generation, even. But change will come, and one day, we will heal the scars of history."\n\nLuna nodded, holding back her disappointment. As always, her sister bore the hard-won wisdom of centuries. The foolish dreams and fancies of the night must always melt away before the illumination of the sun."
 equestria.218.a:0 "A great wrong has been righted."
 equestria.218.b:0 "One day, Equestria will be whole."

Other alternative names have been proposed, however, so [EQS.GetLeader] should consider these options as well."

equestria.170.d:0 "There was a time when everypony lived in awe of the great bears Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. These Bears, with a fur that mirrored the night sky could easily cleave a pony in half and even fought successfully against some of the most powerful unicorns Equestria had ever seen. However, the times of mythical power and wild beasts have, almost unnoticeably, come to a close in Equestria. Sword and staff have been replaced by rifle and howitzer and now a single pony can wield power that was unthinkable even a generation ago. But to fuel the fires of industry that make these marvels possible, clever ponies are always searching for new resources to exploit.\n\nThe search for new materials led a particular company to the ancient hiding places of the Ursae, in a region which was always thought off-limits to ponykind. In times past, claiming the ore-rich caverns that served as a home to the mythical bears would have been considered suicidal. Now, a few dozen hunters with high calibre rifles and explosives set out to clear the area. Carefully preparing their mines on an open field, the hunters made sure to leave nothing to chance. A spell was used to mimic the Ursa Minor's call for help, and the Majors, alarmed, rushed towards the sound. To call what ensued a battle would be too generous as the mythical beasts never even saw their attackers, before they were exterminated by the hunters' heavy weaponry.\n\nThe prospect of a new mine being opened was front-page news in the local paper the following day, with only the lamentations of an old editor on the fourth page reminding the readers that the time of magic was gone. The small column weight the comforts and safety of modern life against the adventure and mystery of the past, concluding that much was gained, but some things were also lost forever."

#MAIN SIX STORY EVENTS
equestria.173.t:0 "Farewell For Now"
equestria.173.d:0 "The small train station in Ponyville rarely had many ponies standing on the platform, but today it was more crowded than ever. Almost a hundred ponies had gathered there, half of them with heavy bags filled with food, tools and other supplies. Those would be necessary, for they were heading on a long journey, from which they may not return. The colourful Friendship Express whistled, signalling that it would soon depart. The mood was solemn and mournful; ponies were embracing each other, bidding farewell and crying.\n\nThey were going to war.\n\nTwilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, was there as well, as were her friends, the Elements of Harmony: Rarity, Fluttershy, Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie. The last three had saddlebags and were preparing to depart.\n"Well, I guess it's time to say good bye," Rainbow Dash said, breaking the silence. "The train's about to go."\nTwilight sighed deeply. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I respect your bravery and your choice to face Chrysalis' army. But I'm worried. This is not like the other threats we've faced. This time, a small band of heroes can't save Equestria. And I want you to remember that. Don't try to be heroes. Stay safe, and don't take unnecessary risks. We all want you to return in one piece."\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes. "Yes Twilight, you've said that a dozen times. Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll buck the changelings back across the border and be back home before Hearth's Warming Eve."\n"But she's right, Rainbow," Fluttershy meekly said. "You need to be careful. War is... terrifying and dangerous."\n"I'll make sure Rainbow doesn't get herself killed," Applejack said and grinned. "Dont'cha fear."\n"And I don't even plan on fighting," Pinkie said cheerily. "I will provide moral support! Cakes and parties will make even the most grim soldier happy. And maybe I can convince the changelings that war isn't as fun as partying!"\nTwilight smiled. "Alright. I trust you will be okay. We'll miss you."\nThe train whistled again.\n"Oh, wait!" Rarity exclaimed. "I still have gifts to give!" She levitated clothing and blankets from her bags and gave them to the three departing friends. "I made fabulous uniforms and cozy blankets to keep you warm."\nThey thanked her and put the gifts in their bags. "Well, we really gotta go now," Rainbow said. "Hugs?" Pinkie asked.\nThe six ponies smiled and embraced each other with their wings and forelegs. "We'll be waiting for you," Twilight whispered, and a tear flowed down her cheek."

equestria.174.d:0 "Spike, Twilight Sparkle's personal dragon assistant and adoptive little brother, had spent more and more time lately in the Crystal Empire where he was celebrated as a hero who had saved the nation from Sombra's return. Now he was back in Ponyville once more, worried about the burden the Great War had placed on the Princess. He entered the Castle of Friendship, whose hallways were empty. He headed to the library and his guess was proven correct: Twilight was there, absorbed in work. She was surrounded by books and notes and was frantically writing.\n"Twilight?" He said, trying to get her attention. "I'm back from the Crystal Empire."\nShe snapped out of it and lifted her gaze from the papers. "Oh, Spike! Glad to see you. You came at a perfect time!" She levitated a scroll from her table into his claws. "Send this to Celestia. It's important."\nSpike lifted a scaly brow. "Uh, sure." He breathed shining green flame which consumed the scroll, making it magically appear in Canterlot. "What was the scroll about?"\n"A report on the research programs I've prepared for the magical experimentation departments in Bales, Stableside and Albion. They need her approval before the research can begin."\n"What are they studying?"\n"Weapons," she said casually and continued to work on her notes. "Crystal armaments, combat mage training, use of magic in industrial production. Anything that can help us win the war."\n"I see." Spike walked closer to Twilight and looked at all the paperwork. "You know, you seem to be doing a good job managing all this. You're not too stressed out."\n"Abyssinian coffee does wonders. But thanks, Spike."\n"You know, maybe you could use your organization skills and leadership for managing the frontline? With your clever head, I'm sure we'd win in a month."\nTwilight's quill stopped moving. She sighed. "I would rather not."\n"Why? Would be more effective than trying to invent some miracle weapon. It's always been thanks to your leadership that we've kicked the butts of all those villains before."\n"I-I don't want to have that responsibility now. It's not just six friends, it's millions of soldiers. A single mistake results in thousands of dead and wounded." She shut her eyes. "I don't want to bear that burden."\n"Twi, you know... one day you won't have a choice. Celestia and Luna won't be princesses forever."\n"I'm not ready yet. Just... not yet. Okay, Spike?"\nSpike sighed. "Alright, fine. Do you need any more help?"\nTwilight smiled. "Yes, actually. I'm happy you're here." She quickly embraced him with her wing before returning back to work."

equestria.175.d:0 ""Ma'am, reinforcements have arrived," a pegasus mare told Applejack.\n"Fantastic! Just when we need 'em. Sergeant, keep an eye on the enemy. I'll go meet the fresh blood." The soldier saluted her and she walked down the muddy trenches, navigating to the rear of the network. Near the underground barracks were a row of trucks, pony soldiers with clean uniforms jumping out of them. A thestral officer saw Applejack and greeted her. "Greetings, ma'am. We've come to patch up your ranks."\n"Good, sir. They've been gettin' more and more sparse. The changelin' night raids are hard as Tartarus to repel." The bat pony turned to his soldiers. "Atten-tion! Miss Applejack is here." They immediately went rigid, standing in a neat line. Applejack approached them and inspected them. "Youngins, I see. I hope they've gotten at least some trainin'," she mumbled. She stopped in front of a red earth pony stallion, her eyes widening. He was wearing Granny Smith's old helmet. "Big Mac? The heck are you doin' here?" she exclaimed. He remained characteristically silent for a moment. "I came here to make sure you're okay, ma'am." Applejack rolled her eyes. "So who's lookin' after the farm now?"\n"Sugar Belle. Don't worry, ma'am." She snorted. "Alrighty then. But don't expect me to treat you differently just because you're my brother."\n"Nope, ma'am."\nLater that evening, the changelings launched a probing raid against the trenches, which they thought were depleted in defenders. Applejack quickly rallied the reinforcements, Big Macintosh among them, to prevent a breakthrough. There was brutal close-quarters combat and she had to crack the exoskeletons of several changelings with her strong hind legs. Big Mac tried to help, which didn't please her much. "Guard our rear, soldier. It's too dangerous here."\n"Yup. Dangerous for you, too."\n"I'll be fine! Now go, it was an order!" As she was shouting, Big Mac looked behind her and saw a changeling lying in the mud raise her head, her pistol glinting in the crimson light of a setting sun. "What're you lookin' at? Get goin'!" Applejack barked. Big Mac pushed her aside into the trench wall, and there was a loud bang. He collapsed onto the ground.\n"Big Mac!" Applejack screamed, and saw the changeling with her smoking pistol. She let out a roar and leaped on her as she was trying to fly away with her broken wings, and began stomping her to death with her hooves. When the insectoid pony had stopped breathing, she rushed back to his brother who was already being treated by a medic. "I-Is he fine?" she asked.\n"Y-yup," Big Mac weakly responded. "Sorry for savin' your life."\nApplejack embraced him. "No, it's me who should be sayin' sorry."\n"Ma'am, his chest is bleeding. I'd appreciate if you'd leave the hugging for later," the medic said."

equestria.176.d:0 "Rainbow Dash had been away from combat ever since she had lost her left wing. Now she was glad to finally be back in action, commanding an air wing and training new pilots when she had time. One day, when refueling at an air base and chatting with ponies of the local garrison, she learned that Pinkie Pie was stationed nearby. She decided to go for a visit, even if it was technically unauthorized absence. So what, she thought, she was an element of harmony.\nAfter asking various soldiers, she finally found the barracks where Pinkie was stationed. She imagined it was a real party house at this point, where Pinkie cheered up the soldiers after tough fights against the changelings. She was wrong. It seemed like an ordinary barracks, with all the bunk beds arrayed in neat order. For a moment she thought she was at the wrong place, but then she saw a pink pony lying on a bed. She barely recognized her.\n"Pinkie?" she cautiously asked. The mare with a straight mane slowly turned to look at her, then her eyes widened slightly. "Oh, Rainbow Dash. Why are you here?" Rainbow was struck by how dour she sounded. The colours of her coat seemed muted as well. "Uh, I thought I'd come by for a visit, to see how you're doing. We haven't talked in a long time."\n"Oh yes. You lost your wing, didn't you?" Rainbow extended her prosthetic metal wing. "Yep. But this new one is pretty rad, so I don't mind. Hurt like Tartarus at first but I'm getting used to it."\n"That's good."\n"Pinkie, is everything alright? Why aren't you... acting like yourself?" Pinkie breathed in deeply and closed her eyes. "I'm fine."\n"I might've lost my wing, but I still have my eyes and I can see something is wrong. What happened?" Pinkie grimaced. "I guess I should tell you, even though I don't want to. A couple months ago I was holding a party for Maud's Rock Troopers. However, there were changeling infiltrators in the group, and they revealed themselves and started shooting." A concerned frown formed on Rainbow's face. "Oh no. And then what?"\nShe shrugged. "I did what I had to, out of fear and desperation. In the end, the changelings were dead, and the party was thoroughly pooped."\nIt was a typical Pinkie joke, but the delivery was so dry that even Rainbow wasn't amused. "That... sucks. I wish I could've been there to protect you."\n"I don't need that anymore. I fight with Maud on the front. I haven't been in the mood for happy things after the incident."\nRainbow was speechless. "Pinkie, I—"\n"I'm fine, like I said. Don't you worry. War isn't the place for laughter. But after it's over, everything will be fine again."\n"Promise? I wanna to see you smile and hear you laugh. We can do our old pranks, maybe that will make you feel better." A faint smile appeared on Pinkie's lips. "Sure, Dashie.""

equestria.177.d:0 "Clothing design was Rarity's passion, that could not be debated. But after months of designing dull military uniforms with drab colours and directing their production en masse, she was growing tired of it. Occasionally, when she had precious free time, she'd try to design a beautiful dress for her own enjoyment, but oftentimes even that wasn't as satisfying as it had been before the war. So now, when she had a day off, she needed another distraction from the stress of war-time production. She decided to visit her friend Fluttershy, who had recently come to Canterlot, and headed to her apartment near the underground magi-nuclear research facility, her mind full of questions.\n\nAs soon as the door of her home was opened, the stench of animals filled Rarity's nostrils. Fluttershy greeted her warmly, not minding the odour as usual. "Oh, hi Rarity, good to see you! I hope you don't mind that I brought some friends along from Ponyville." A bear was sitting on the living room sofa.\n"Uhm, no, not at all darling! Now, prepare some hot water. I'd like to drink tea and have a pleasant chat. We haven't seen in so long, goodness gracious!"\nA toucan and a ferret prepared two cups of steaming tea. Fluttershy thanked the animals and they replied with cheery sounds.\n"So, Fluttershy, first of all: What in Celestia's name are you doing in a magi-nuclear research facility?"\n"Oh, erm, I know it seems strange, but as the Element of Kindness, I was asked to give ethical oversight to the development of magi-nuclear weapons. I accepted, because I think it's important they're developed, and are then used right."\nRarity raised an eyebrow. "You think it's important that they're developed? Aren't they... extremely potent, from what I've heard?"\n"Oh, yes. That is the point. You see, their intent is to act as a deterrent and a threat. Once we have a working magi-nuclear bomb, Queen Chrysalis will be so scared that she will sue for peace for sure! And then no one else will ever threaten Equestria again."\n"I cannot help but regard that as quite optimistic. Chrysalis seems very determined in her cause. Also, what if someone else develops such a weapon?"\nFluttershy smiled. "The day when two countries can annihilate each other in one second, all of the world, it is to be hoped, will recoil from war and discharge their troops. We will have world peace forever."\nRarity couldn't help but feel uneasy, and that this was going to end poorly. But she did not want to ruin the mood or insult Fluttershy. This seemed important to her. It was best to change the topic. "Well, I hope everything works out. So, who looks after your animal sanctuary?""

The old Friendship Express had been destroyed by a changeling bombing raid, so they returned home on a repurposed cargo train. It wasn't a comfortable ride, but they were still happy because they were finally together again.\nRainbow broke the silence between them. "So, we won. How many changelings did you kill? I got 241, mostly from air combat."\n"The heck? You kept count? Is everything a competition for you?" Applejack asked, appalled. "Anyhow, 242, mostly from close quarters combat, as my scars show."\nRainbow Dash chuckled. "Welp, better luck next time for me, I guess." She turned to Pinkie Pie, who still hadn't said anything. "Yo Pinkie, you alright? Remember what you promised to me. I miss your laugther."\nShe sighed. "Not now, Dashie. But maybe later."\n\nThe train whistled and arrived at Ponyville's station, or what remained of it after wartime bombing. The three mares left the carriage and were embraced by Twilight, Rarity and Fluttershy, who were there to meet them. "I'm so happy to see you!" Twilight said and struggled to hold back tears. "You all made it back home in one piece."\n"Rainbow didn't," Applejack said, grinned and poked her prosthetic metal wing.\n"Oh, you three look so weary and battered, and your clothes are beginning to fall apart!" Rarity exclaimed.\n"Well, you don't win wars by looking fancy," Rainbow said with a grin.\n"What's wrong, Pinkie?" Fluttershy asked with concern in her voice. All five turned to look at her. Pinkie averted eye contact.\n"Nothing. I'm glad to be back home. Even though it may not seem like it."\n"You know, Pinkie," Twilight said, "Ponyville is preparing to hold a party to celebrate the end of the war. But I think they need someone to organize it."\n"Aha."\n"Wouldn't you like to do that, darling?" Rarity asked. "Maybe that would make you feel better."\nPinkie sighed. "Alright, fine. But I think I will need you guys to help. I've gotten a bit rusty. And... well, I'm not the same as I was."\nRainbow wrapped her metal wing around her. "Pinkie, we'll be with you, always. And we will do anything to make you happy again. Of course we'll help you with the party. No need to even ask such silly things."\nHesitantly, Pinkie hugged her back, then embraced her tight and began to cry.

equestria.181.d:0 "Recently, as pony soldiers on the front prepared to celebrate Hearth's Warming Eve, something strange happened. There have been reports that at one fortified position near the changeling frontline, some ponies climbed over the trench waving a white flag. Changelings honourably did not open fire and allowed the enemy soldiers to get near. The ponies then invited the changelings soldiers to celebrate Hearth's Warming with them in No Creature's Land. Surprisingly, some of the changelings, even a few officers, accepted the offer.\n\nAs the moon rose, the ponies and changelings drank cider and hot chocolate milk, sang carols and even played some hoofball. Soldiers casually chatted with each other, talking of their families and civilian lives, and telling traditional stories. Changelings of course do not celebrate pony holidays, but were very curious and seemed to enjoy it.\n\nAfter reports of the incident spread, the high command on both sides reacted. The Equestrian army used this as a chance to show the value of friendship and that changelings were fighting against their will, using the opportunity to portray Chrysalis and her posse as warmongering tyrants. On the other side, the Queen was outraged by this and forbid any knowledge of it to spread, putting the nation's censorship bureaus to work. She then ordered capital punishment on every single soldier and officer who had taken part in the "treachery". However, some of the changelings managed to desert and escape, being welcomed warmly by Equestrian soldiers. They are now prisoners of war but are treated well."

She was encouraged to hold the event by Princess Luna so various disputes could be resolved before they reached a boiling point. Princess Twilight Sparkle was once again responsible for organizing the event. The last summit held in 1005 had almost been an embarrasing fiasco, so extra precautions were made to ensure everything would go smoothly. This time there would be no giant gemstone statue due to the last summit's incident.\n\nThe summit ended up being almost as large as the last one, with delegates from over fifty cities and towns arriving in the capital. There were three days of conferences, receptions and meetings, with Princesses attending them actively. Representatives spoke openly of issues in their home towns: Mayor Ash Moustache's delegate from Baltimare spoke of issues with integrating the local thestral minority and the rising influence of anarcho-syndicalist CAN-TER, Mayor Goldwin's delegate from Vanhoover said something had to be done about Stalliongradian infiltration of the navy stationed in the city, Mayor Rokenhar's delegate from Las Pegasus spoke of the corruption and greed of local companies while representatives of other south-western cities complained of neglect from the central government. Most ominously, the delegate from Acornage warned of ever-growing Changeling military activity on the border. The Princesses took note of all the issues and promised that they would be taken care of.\n\nThe rest of the summit was spent making trade deals, celebrating the local cultures of Equestria's numerous cities, holding speeches on matters of economy and politics and discussing the events of the world at large. At the end of the event, Princess Celestia held a speech thanking everypony for coming all the way to Canterlot and said that as long as the cities of Equestria worked together in harmony, the country as a whole would have a bright and prosperous future."

equestria.184.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle looked over the reports she had laid out on the desk before her, a look of heavy concern plastered on her face. After Nightmare Moon has risen once again and plunged Equestria into a full civil war, Twilight had volunteered to help in some of the more administrative tasks involving the military. That meant filing through all the reports that the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them didn't paint a good picture of what was going on, especially in the high command.\n\nPutting it straight, Luna's fall had torn a hole in the general staff. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was still clear that he couldn't lead the entire Equestrian Army. They needed somepony to fill the place that the Princess of the Night had left, at least until a more permanent replacement could be found. But who could possibly do that? It was clear the generals didn't know, since all the reports were just blaming Blueblood when he just couldn't do everything at once. Twilight needed to figure it out, and soon.\n\nAnd then it came to her. There was one pony she knew who could help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and frankly Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. But even with all that, Twilight was sure that she would still answer her call, and hopefully agree to help Equestria in its darkest hour. She was the best fit for the pony that they needed.\n\nBut first... Twilight levitated a large book from a drawer and opened it to the newest blank page. It was time to write a letter."

Sunset took a seat across from Twilight, noticing a glass already in front of her. "Tea? Should have known you'd already have it ready for me."\n\nTwilight nodded with a slight smile before taking a sip. "So, how things been going for you?"\n\nShe gave a small laugh. "Fine, I guess. Though we both know you wouldn't send a message calling me here if you didn't need me for something." Sunset put down her teacup and sighed. "Guess I better tell my friends that I'll be gone for a while, since I'm guessing it's related to how Equestria is... in a bit of trouble right now."\n\nTwilight nodded. "You're right, and that's exactly why I'm here. You're the only one I know who could help."\n\n"Alright, just tell me. Do you need me to help Equestria win?"\n\n"Yes.

Somepony else needs to help lead, and I know you learned a lot from your long time in the mirror world-"\n\n"Whoa, slow down," Sunset said, putting her hooves out. "I'm honored, Twilight, but are you sure that you want me leading an army? It's not like I've been doing that back with my friends, and it still hasn't even been that long since I stole your Element of Magic-"\n\nThe alicorn reached across the table and held one of Sunset's hooves. "Sunset. I know this is sudden, but I need you. Equestria needs you! Nightmare Moon and her followers are killing ponies as we speak, and the longer this civil war goes on..." Twilight trailed off for a moment. "I don't know how much more Equestria, or Princess Celestia can take."\n\nSilence held in the air for a few moments while the two ponies stared at each other. Then, letting go of Twilight, Sunset got off her chair and stood up. "Alright, Twilight," she said, a familiar gleam in her eyes. "I'm in. Just tell me what you need me to do.""

equestria.186.t:0 "A New Beginning"
equestria.186.d:0 "In a cafe within Canterlot, two mares sat at a table across from each other, each with a cup of coffee. Much like the other patrons there, they talked while slowly enjoying their drinks, most ponies not even noticing them. The few that did, however, couldn't help but stare or at least occasionally glance at the pair enjoying their day.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't often that a pony got to see a Princess of Equestria and one of the highest ranking officers of the Equestrian Army.\n\n"I'm so glad we could both find time out of our schedule to meet here," Twilight said to Sunset, who nodded wordlessly. "I wanted to see you more often after we met in the castle, but with the war I was just too busy to even get a chance!"\n\n"Same," Sunset agreed, putting down her coffee. "Nightmare Moon and her forces never took breaks, and neither could we. Prince Blueblood and I had contests on who could pull longer all-nighters." She leaned in conspiratorially. "I think he might be jealous on how I won all the time."\n\nThey both shared a laugh. "Sunset, you know you don't have to keep doing this if you don't want to, right?" Twilight suddenly asked, her face more serious. "I know I put a lot on you, asking you to fill Luna's old role, but now that we've defeated Nightmare Moon you can always go back to your old friends. I mean, I don't want you to feel like you have to do this for me or anything-"\n\n"Twilight." The Princess paused to look at her friend, who was staring at her. "Don't worry about it. Telling the truth, I was getting a little bored back there. I've already sent them a note letting them know I'll be staying here for a while longer, and they're doing fine without me." Suddenly, Sunset smirked. "Besides, it's nice knowing I've probably saved Equestria more times than you have by now."\n\nTwilight reached over to punch Sunset's shoulder before the two laughed again. "Well, as long as you want to stay here," Twilight said, her spirit much lighter again.\n\nSunset nodded, right before she got a devious look, one that Twilight was almost afraid of. "Hey, since you said I'm taking Luna's place, do you think I'll get to become an alicorn too?" Sunset asked in a clearly teasing tone. "I know I don't exactly have the most moon-related cutie mark, but I think I could do a pretty good job with this whole "protecting ponies' dreams" thing."\n\nNow it was Twilight's turn to smirk, barely keeping a full smile off her face."

equestria.188.t:0 "The Former Student"
equestria.188.d:0 ""Princess, somepony is requesting an audience with you. She says she knows you."\n\nCelestia broke out of the distracted trance she was in, turning her attention back to the present. The war was not going well for Equestria, or for her ponies. The enemy was being relentless in their assaults, overrunning any defense Equestria could muster. Luna and Blueblood were doing their best, but it still wasn't enough to stop the advance. And all Celestia could do was watch from Canterlot, and lead her ponies from her throne while they fought and died for her and Equestria on the front lines...\n\nBut that wasn't what she needed to focus on at the moment. "Let her in," Celestia said, wondering who it could be. She knew many ponies in Canterlot, but the guards knew most of their names. So who was left that they would not know but she would?\n\nThat answer soon came when the doors across the room opened, and a yellow unicorn mare entered. Celestia's breath still caught in her throat for a moment when she recognized who it was, despite having seen her before not too long ago; her former student.\n\n"Princess Celestia, I know it must be a bit of a surprise to see me here," Sunset Shimmer said as she walked forward, determined but still respectful. "But I found out what's happened. How Equestria is in danger, and not just from some magical creature this time."\n\nCelestia remained silent as Sunset continued. "When Twilight first chased after me into the other world, I didn't come back with her because I was too scared to face you. I had hated you for so long, I didn't know what else to do. And I knew I should have come back to apologize then, to ask for your forgiveness, but I couldn't bring myself to come back to Canterlot." Sunset took a deep breath. "So I stayed instead. I made new friends, went on new adventures, learned new lessons I never would have if I hadn't jumped through the portal all those years ago. Even after I came back, I had hoped that I could find a new life there and be a hero just like Twilight."\n\nSuddenly, her voice became much clearer and steady. "Now though, I realize that it isn't there that I'm needed anymore, but here. Equestria is in trouble, and everypony needs to do their part. So that's why I'm here, to ask for you to allow me to help in any way I can."\n\nCelestia did not say anything. Instead, she got up from her throne and walked down towards Sunset, never breaking eye contact. With every step the unicorn's confidence faltered, but she remained resolute when the Princess finally reached her. Sunset blinked as Celestia laid a hoof on her, before she pulled her former student into an embrace.\n\n"Thank you, Sunset Shimmer," she said. And almost immediately, the unicorn returned the hug in kind."

The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for the realm and all their subjects. The tales of these sisters stretch back far beyond recorded history, and their achievements in defeating Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and other terrors have become legendary.\n\nPrincess Celestia is the elder of the two sisters, and the Princess of the Sun along with her traditional role as a diarch of Equestria. Charged with raising the sun and until recently the moon, it was she who was responsible for banishing her own sister Princess Luna to the moon following her fall into darkness, as well as the thousand years of relative peace and prosperity that followed. Through it all she has ruled with a light hoof, only stepping in when necessary to preserve harmony throughout the realm. And though all of Equestria had forgotten Luna, it was Celestia who remembered her sister and welcomed her back following the defeat of Nightmare Moon by Twilight Sparkle.\n\nSince that fateful day, much has transpired in Equestria. The changelings led by Queen Chrysalis came close to capturing Canterlot in 1002, and attacks by both a resurgent King Sombra and Lord Tirek have only been barely repulsed by Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Still, Celestia is not blind to the threats that lay both within and without Equestria's borders. The enemies of harmony can no longer be defeated by friendship and magic, and only time will tell if Equestria's greatest proponent of peace, kindness and cooperation can keep up with the modern era of technology and progress.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the onslaught of a merciless war leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far more totalitarian.

Raised in the palace with all the prestige and notoriety that the only informal relative to Princess Celestia at the time had, Blueblood soon found that less and less of his aunt's time was devoted to him in favor of the newly-ascended Princess Cadance, her first student Sunset Shimmer, and later her second and future Princess Twilight Sparkle. Rather than complain, which he believed to be ill-fitting of a pony of his position, he instead utilized his free time immersing himself at the head of Equestrian high society.\n\nThis continued for quite some time, and barring a brief debacle involving a Grand Galloping Gala and the Element Bearer of Generosity Blueblood remained a relatively stable fixture of the wealthy in Canterlot. Even following the Canterlot Attack in 1002, when the army reforms were just beginning, Blueblood used his relation to Princess Celestia and his influence in Canterlot to secure the rank of the first Equestrian Field Marshal, practically a purely ceremonial title at the time. However, everything changed in 1005.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Ain Trotgourait and a private talk with his aunt, Blueblood threw himself with surprising seriousness into his newly assigned duties of reforming the Equestrian armed forces by modern standards. Palace officials found him studying Griffonian and Zebrican tactics, histories of warfare, and foreign military organization.

Almost nopony could have suspected what future was in store for her, nor the sheer amount of time, effort and dedication she put in to being the most skilled pegasi in Cloudsdale. It was never natural talent that carried her, but an unshakable force of determination and diligence to do her best and then some.\n\nOnce she came of age, Spitfire easily won the Best Young Flyer competition in Cloudsdale that year, gaining the attention of the Wonderbolts. Applying herself to running through the Wonderbolts Academy with top marks, the Wonderbolt Captain before her pulled her aside and explained that he would soon be retiring, and that he wanted her to take his place when the time came. He saw that the Wonderbolts of tomorrow would be defined not by their raw talent, but by how hard they could push themselves to be better than they were yesterday. And by 998, Spitfire had broken the academy record for fastest promotion to Captain of the Wonderbolts.\n\nIn the last decade, Spitfire has taken on many positions from leading Wonderbolt aerial shows to acting as drill sergeant for the Wonderbolts Academy and, following the Battle of Ain Trotgourait in 1005, the formal military position of Air Chief Marshal and the task of creating a new Equestrian air force.

In fact, he had never dreamed of becoming one in the first place. In his mind, his future was one in the weather factory much like his parents, living the easy life. Fate however had other ideas in store, once he found his talent in the skies outflying many of his fellow fillies and colts.\n\nSoarin did not win the year he entered the Best Young Flyer Competition; that honor went to Fleetfoot. That did not stop the Wonderbolts from offering him an acceptance letter to the Academy, which he took at the advice of his friends and family. Soarin was not a star student, but his peers respected him for other reasons; he was not preoccupied with being the best as much as he was having fun. Such a relaxed attitude made him many friends, and when he became a full-fledged Wonderbolt he quickly became one of the most renowned in Equestria for his easygoing nature.\n\nThis notoriety helped him become the official second-in-command of the Wonderbolts in 1002 right before the Canterlot attack, but it was only in 1005 after Ain Trotgourait that he was given the military rank of Air Marshal. Soarin prefers to handle the more administrative parts of the army and air force, as well as aiding Spitfire in the various duties as an officer. And while he'll never turn down a slice of apple pie, everypony knows he takes his job just as seriously as anypony else would.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_FLEETFOOT_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of February, 981 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: When one thinks of raw talent in a pegasus, their mind would usually go to a pony such as the legendary Rainbow Dash or until recently Lightning Dust. Few would remember that Fleetfoot was right alongside them since the very beginning. A filly with the speed and agility to go far, she saw the path in her life from the start; an easy road to the Wonderbolts, to fame, and eventually taking her place as one of the fastest flyers of Equestria.\n\nHowever, things would not come so easily for the filly. She soon found herself outclassed by the rising star Spitfire, and only barely managed to win against Soarin at the Best Young Flyer Competition. This, combined with her time in the Wonderbolts Academy helped Fleetfoot realize that it is not just about natural talent, but also how much you can apply yourself using it. With that in mind she turned over a new leaf, studying the moves of Wonderbolts past and watching and listening to her fellow cadets to improve her own skills, eventually resulting in graduating as a full Wonderbolt in almost record time.\n\nNowadays, Fleetfoot acts as one of the Wonderbolts' fastest flyers and as one of the newly-appointed Air Marshals alongside Soarin since 1005. She prefers the more hooves-on aspects of her officer's role, test-flying new generations of fighter planes and giving feedback to Spitfire on their practical applications. To her, flying is still a serious business whether it be by wing or by plane, and she'd rather stay grounded than be in the air without skill, speed and style.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
EQS_FLASHMAGNUS_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown Date, in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Captain of the Royal Guard\n\n§YBiography§!: Countless centuries ago, the Equestria that Flash Magnus lived in was a far different land. Not much is known of his early life in ancient Cloudsdale, and what is known is mere speculation and legends passed down through the Canterlot and Cloudsdale Archives. But what the legends do say is impressive; wielding the legendary fireproof shield Netitus as a member of the Cloudsdale Royal Legion, he has faced dragons, thunderstorms, and the forces of darkness itself.\n\nLater legends, particularly those confirmed by Stygian tell Flash Magnus as a Pillar of Old Equestria, representing the Element of Bravery. Assembled by Stygian to face the threat of the sirens, he much like his fellow Pillars were sent to Limbo in an attempt to seal the Pony of Shadows, and was only saved in the present day by Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\n\nAfter a brief period of adjusting to modern society, Flash Magnus found himself under the employ of the Crown and the Princesses, becoming a drill sergeant for the woefully outdated Royal Guard. His dedication, loyalty and distinguished service, as well as the legends surrounding him all culminated in his promotion to Captain of the Royal Guard, replacing the absent Shining Armor. And while some may question having an ancient legionnaire reform the the institution, Flash is determined to show that an old stallion can still teach some new tricks.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "
EQS_SUNSET_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March, 974 in Prancisco\n\n§YRank§!: Field Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Sunset Shimmer has long been defined by one thing that has continued to drive her forward - ambition. As an orphaned filly in Prancisco, she took her natural gift at magic and turned it into her sole focus in life, accomplishing feats at a young age that many other unicorns could never do in their entire lives. Such early mastery of magic caught the attention of the School of Gifted Unicorns, and eventually even the eye of Princess Celestia herself. Such was her talent that the alicorn did something unprecedented in her long reign; she took on the unicorn as her own personal student, hoping to nurture her into becoming the Element of Magic.\n\nSunset's ambition proved too much for the Princess to handle however, and following an incident in 993 where she demanded to be made an alicorn Celestia banished her student from the castle. Instead of leaving, Sunset chose to flee through a magical mirror into an alternate dimension, where she stayed for almost a decade. It was only in 1002 shortly after Princess Twilight's coronation that she returned to steal the Element of Magic. The events that followed across the mirror are a secret known only by the Princesses and Twilight's closest friends.\n\nBarring a few more events involving Princess Twilight crossing the mirror again, very little was heard from Sunset Shimmer for some time. It was only after Equestria found itself in danger that she returned. With the intercession of Princess Twilight, Sunset was given a position as an Equestrian Field Marshal to the confusion of many. Nevertheless she has proven herself well in the position, even if many in the general staff find her relative youth and strange mannerisms confusing.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_MAUD_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of June, 981 on the Pie Family Rock Farm\n\n§YRank§!: General\n\n§YBiography§!: Rocktor Maud Pie, full name Maudileena Daisy Pie is the second Pie Sister and one of Element Bearer Pinkie Pie's older siblings. Having grown up in the southwestern rock farms, Maud spent much of her life studying to be admitted to the Equestrian Institute of Rockology. During her time studying for her degree in Rock Science she made many important geological discoveries such as the exploration of the Crystal Mountain Range cave systems, and she soon graduated with full honors as valerocktorian of her class.\n\nFollowing her studies, Maud moved into a gem cave near Ponyville and found a coltfriend, Mudbriar. While it was expected that she would continue her research into the many rocks of Equestria and their properties, many including her own sister Pinkie were surprised when she volunteered to lead the Equestrian Army alongside her sibling Limestone Pie. The exact reasoning remains a mystery, though some suspect that it stems from a desire to protect Pinkie from the horrors of war.\n\nMaud has a dry demeanor, monotonous tone of voice, and almost never smiles as a sharp contrast to her famous sister. Despite this attitude she still has a deep passion for rocks, and deeply loves her family. As a general she primarily leads a commando unit of earth ponies along with her sister Limestone, and acts as a first-degree combat geologist utilizing her vast geological knowledge alongside her incredible speed and tremendous physical strength. Soldiers say that if Maud Pie can't hold a defensive position, then nopony can.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
EQS_LIMESTONE_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of March, 980 on the Pie Family Rock Farm\n\n§YRank§!: Lieutenant General\n\n§YBiography§!: As the oldest of the four Pie Sisters, Limestone Pie has rarely ever known a life outside the rock farm. Raised to be the inheritor of the farm and to carry on the Pie Family legacy, her entire childhood was spent learning the time-tested methods and traditions of the southwest, tending to and mining the rocks on the fields. Following Maud leaving to pursue her degree in Rock Science and Pinkie leaving to spread laughter across Equestria and settling in Ponyville, Limestone took over managing the farm from her parents and expected a long life of honest work alone ahead of her.\n\nThe war changed all that. When Limestone heard that her sister Maud was joining the army, she quickly left the farm back in the hooves of her parents and demanded to be made an officer as well. Given her almost inequine strength and a desire by multiple government officials not to have their bones shattered, she was made a Lieutenant General second-in-command to Maud Pie in the newly formed earth pony commando group. The rock farmer has taken to the role with the utmost seriousness, performing surprisingly well in leadership positions.\n\nLimestone is an incredibly aggressive and commanding pony, something that causes friction on occasion with superior officers. Nopony can deny her effectiveness in keeping discipline though, and many attribute to her the incredible effectiveness of the commandos whom she remains protective of. In her mind, they are all that stand between everything she loves whether it be her sisters, the rock farm or Holder's Boulder; everypony else can either fall in line behind them or get out of the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "
EQS_FIZZLEPOP_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of January, 972 in Blackthorn\n\n§YRank§!: General\n\n§YBiography§!: Many years ago Fizzlepop Berrytwist was a unicorn filly much like any other, with dreams of attending Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns along with her friends Spring Rain and Glitter Drops. But one fateful day, an encounter with an ursa minor left her horn shattered and her face scarred. Feeling abandoned by her friends who soon left for Canterlot to continue their studies without her, Fizzlepop eventually turned her back on Equestria and left seeking to find a new path in life and become a fearsome warrior, taking the name Tempest Shadow.\n\nAfter some brief adventures in Abyssinia and Klugetown involving the Misfortune Malachite, Tempest struck a deal with none other than the Storm King; in return for acting as his second-in-command and right hoof, he would restore her horn upon conquering Equestria. She accompanied and led his armies on their conquest of North Zebrica as a ruthless military leader, shoving all memories of her past in Equestria aside. It was only at that Battle of Ain Trotgourait when Princess Twilight Sparkle reminded her of the value in friendship and harmony, convincing her to betray the Storm King resulting in his death and a Hippogriffian victory over the invading forces.\n\nSince then, Fizzlepop had returned to Equestria with Twilight and traveled the nation seeking to help others in need and make a difference. And yet, no matter what she did, she never felt like she fit in or belonged in a peaceful land that knew nothing but friendship. So when Equestria came calling for new minds to help in its defense, Fizzlepop returned to take up a new command, this time under the flag of Harmony. Her blunt and cynical personality as well as her knowledge of war provides much to the command staff, and she is determined to prove herself and take any opportunity to defeat difficult opponents, whether that be in personal combat or with armies on the battlefield.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "
EQS_RAINBOW_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of March, 981 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: General\n\n§YBiography§!: Very few ponies in Equestria have not heard of Rainbow Dash. As a young filly, she gained her cutie mark in summer flight camp after performing a legendary Sonic Rainboom. After moving to Ponyville with her close friend Fluttershy, she joined the local weather patrol while training herself in the hopes of joining the Wonderbolts. It was during this time that she met the future Princess of Equestria, Twilight Sparkle, and discovered her role as the Bearer of the Element of Loyalty during Nightmare Moon's return in 1000.\n\nFollowing the return of Princess Luna to Equestria, Rainbow Dash's skills and fame only grew across Equestria. Finally gaining entrance to the Wonderbolts as a trainee in 1002, her dedication and loyalty made her a full-fledged member only two years later. She has played a major role in defeating many of Equestria's major magical threats over the previous decade, including Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and the Pony of Shadows. In more recent times, Rainbow has also become a teacher at Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship.\n\nRainbow is a brash, competitive and egotistical pony, albeit one who has the skills to back all of her claims of being 'the greatest flyer in all of Equestria'. But above all else she is loyal to her friends and to Equestria, and it is that loyalty that pushed her to seek a position in the new Equestrian Army as a general. Though unfocused and disorganized, she has proven to be an extremely dedicated and effective commander preferring to lead from the front with her troops in battle. Still, even with her near-flawless record some still believe that one day her reckless nature will come back to haunt her...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

However, her reckless nature and leadership style of leading from the front caused a major combat injury in the form of losing her entire left wing. Now replaced with a prosthetic, many under her command regard the pegasus as more a force of nature than a military commander; her usually carefree and confident attitude replaced with nothing but cold unrelenting determination to achieve victory.

Born the third child of the Pie family near Rockville, she gained her cutie mark one day after witnessing Rainbow Dash's Sonic Rainboom, discovering that her special talent in life was spreading joy to other ponies. After moving to Ponyville she took up baking at Sugarcube Corner, and soon became the Bearer of the Element of Laughter while helping Twilight Sparkle defeat Nightmare Moon in the year 1000.\n\nSince then, Pinkie Pie has played a major role in defeating many of Equestria's threats, including King Sombra, Lord Tirek and the Pony of Shadows. As an honorary yak, she also served as the unofficial diplomat to the Kingdom of Yakyakistan during their exit from isolation under Prince Rutherford, and taught lessons at the School of Friendship about the role of laughter in harmony.\n\nIn the past, Pinkie Pie was an excitable, hyperactive and social pony, albeit with strange mannerisms and occasional insecurities. However, the recent war has drastically changed her personality, turning her into a distant and depressive, if determined general in the Equestrian Army. Most soldiers under her command appreciate her fourth-wall bending powers and experience in defending positions from her background as a rock farmer, but some of her aides whisper of regular emotional breakdowns and requests of leaving casualities out of operational reports. Still, her unique skillset has proven to be vital to the Equestrian war effort, and she continues to willingly serve in its defense despite the toll on her mental state.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

Her efforts in guarding the dreams of ponies are greatly appreciated, but what is Luna's greatest contribution today is leading ponies in the field, much like in the glory days of old before Equestria's unification.

They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private schools, and once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions (who were suitably intimidated). After Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. During the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. Undaunted by a major injury, she simply cobbled a makeshift eyepatch and cantered back to her duty.

LEADER_OLI_DESC:0 "Like many of the thestrals who were shunned and forgotten, Oli Equites lived with his fellow bat ponies in the caves, ignored by all. It was not the ideal kind of life, lacking comforts and acceptance, but as long as they had each other, the thestrals were content. This isolation was broken when Princess Luna led her campaign to bring the issue to the forefront of the Equestrian public. Her words captured Oli's thoughts and he went off, despite his parents' protests, into the world beyond the cave.\nHis first and foremost desire was to protect the harmony Luna preached, especially after the incident occurred. Although nopony was hurt, and the event may have actually contributed to achieving rights for thestrals, Oli wanted to ensure that such would never occur again, and he made his way to the nearest recruitment centre. After proving his worth through an arduous training regimen, Oli became one of the first non-commissioned bat pony officers in the Equestrian army, proudly serving for the diarchy."

###TECHNOLOGY###
EQS_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Yak 'Tank' Infantry Fighting Vehicle"
EQS_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Equestria, reeling from the military defeats during the conflict with Stalliongrad rushed to produce prototype copies of the makeshift Stalliongrad vehicles. One tester, nearly overwhelmed by the exhaust choking the poorly ventilated interior, likened the experience to 'sitting inside of a fuel tank'. Critics of the project seized on the comment, and the nickname 'tank' stuck, with the true name quickly forgotten."
EQS_gw_tank_equipment_short:0 "Yak 'Tank'"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Breezie"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Following the failure of initial designs to produce adequate results for the new role tanks were entering on the battlefield, Equestrian theorists finally came up with the Breezie towards the end of 1005. Fast, lightly armored, and mostly designed to engage in infantry and unarmored targets it was nevertheless the first major step in Equestrian tank development. Despite major design flaws, lack of Equestrian production meant it saw limited combat in the initial stages of the Great War."
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Breezie"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Seabreeze"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Seabreeze was in essence a modernized Breezie tank, given a larger gun able to penetrate armor and better protection to defend against similar light tanks while still remaining light and fast. The Seabreezes that were deployed in the Great War proved to be effective at fighting off changeling infantry offensives, but stood little chance against larger and more modern tank designs like the Panzers the Heer was already mass producing."
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Seabreeze"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Parasprite"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially a Muletilda replacement, the Rainbow's development was massively delayed due to its design being 'appropriated and adjusted' for the Timberwolf, a temporary Twilight stand-in. When the lighter Rainbow design was finally ready, it was arguably already obsolete, as Equestria struggled to repel the seemingly endless tide of well armoured Changeling Panzers."

EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Cragadile"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experience with the Muletilda quickly demonstrated that tanks with greater protection and firepower were needed. Work on a new design, the Twilight, began, but progressed so slowly that a stopgap was required. The result was the Timberwolf, a modification of the incomplete Rainbow project, with a new engine, more armor, redesigned turret, and larger main gun added. The Timberwolf was the first Equestrian tank to combine adequate speed, respectable armour, and significant firepower."
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Cragadile"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Timberwolf"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The story of the Twilight is the story of the Equestrian war in microcosm. An ambitious magitek design proposed at the onset of the Great War, its development began in an era of administrative chaos and was badly delayed. Ambition met reality, and the magitek elements were abandoned due to a lack of required specialist unicorn mechanics. When the Twilight finally began production, Equestria was a new, reformed military machine, and it symbolised the awakening of Equestrian military power."
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Timberwolf"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Manticore"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "With new expertise from the Stalliongrad tech sharing project the Comet revisited the ambitious goals of the Twilight, but with a more realistic approach. More refined in its systems, it utilized the very best of Equestrian technology. Arriving in time to lead the drive into the heart of the Changeling Lands, Comet tanks became a symbol of Equestrian liberation and victory, as they rolled through formerly occupied towns of cheering deer and sullen, defeated, hives."

EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Bugbear"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The development of tanks led to two schools of thought on their use. The 'Trotists' envisioned them as the final word against frontier predators and localized threats, able to defend a village from elder dragons or work closely with infantry to clear out a rogue Changeling hive. The Cerberus was designed to their specifications; expensive, slow, and prone to mechanical problems, it had decent armour and carried significant firepower in its multiple turrets."
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Bugbear"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Cerberus"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Experience with heavy combat demonstrated a need for larger, better armoured, tanks, with powerful main guns, to counter enemy tanks and entrenched defenses, and act as the spearhead for breakthrough forces. The Celestia was designed in response to those requirements, and, while it suffered from mechanical issues due to its weight and the failure of hoped-for magitek engine and transmission system components to be manufacturable on an adequate scale, it was judged to be generally effective in those roles."
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Cerberus"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Ursa Minor"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially conceived to support a spearhead by the (ultimately shelved) Ursa Major, the (now ironically named) Ursa Minor refined the Celestia's design. Longer, with a new turret, and larger main gun, its mechanical systems were improved, and the armor somewhat reworked. It was effective as an improved breakthrough tank, but the mechanical issues were not entirely solved and it remained quite slow."

EQS_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Ursa Major"
EQS_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As the daunting task of taking the fight into the Changeling Lands approached, many unusual and extreme designs were considered. Envisioned as the ultimate expression of raw force, this design's engineers hoped pure brawn could defeat Changeling cunning and resistance. It was ultimately shelved, with only a few prototypes produced, as much needed reinforcements of common sense continued to pour into Equestrian bureaucracy."

EQS_airships1_desc:0 "As one of the first nations to extensively utilize travel via airship, Equestria's transportation industry had a large fleet of airships by the time the Storm King began his conquest of Zebrica. For a short time plans were drawn up to convert these civilian vessels for military use as an Equestrian airfleet, but they were quickly scrapped following the Hippogriff showcase of fighters as the future of aerial combat."

EQS_fighter_equipment_0:0 "Wonderbolt Stinger"
EQS_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "Following the defeat of the Storm King, the Wonderbolts were tasked with making a biplane combat model for the new Royal Equestrian Air Force. The Stinger was their result, a model created from studying Hippogriffian military aircraft and applying it to Equestrian domestic technology. Though the Stinger was arguably obsolete by the time of its release in 1006, it was still produced and saw limited combat in the Great War as Equestria desperately fought to control the skies."

EQS_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Wonderbolt Vapor"
EQS_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "As conflict with the Changeling Queendom seemed ever more certain, the Wonderbolt Design Bureau began work on their first monoplane model, the Vapor. With a stronger frame and engine capable of reaching speeds only the most talented pegasi could hope to match, it performed admirably in the Great War despite its reduced agility and lackluster production numbers due to disagreements between the Wonderbolts and the Royal Guard on funding."

EQS_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Wonderbolt Whiplash"
EQS_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "With casualities mounting and under pressure to close the technological gap with the Changeling Luftwaffe, the Whiplash was developed as the war seemed to continue moving against Equestria. Improving on the design of the Vapor in almost every aspect, particularly in armaments, it was the most produced Equestrian aircraft in the Great War due to its general performance and popularity among pilots and played an instrumental role in countless air battles."

EQS_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Wonderbolt Spitfire"
EQS_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Spitfire was the final word in traditional fighter design, being produced as the signature Equestrian aircraft in the late stages of the Great War as the conflict turned decisively against the Changeling Queendom. With no equal in the sky at the times of its creation, the Spitfire secured aerial dominance over both Equestria and the changeling homeland, and was used and studied internationally long after standard turboprop engine designs were made obsolete."

EQS_CAS_equipment_1:0 "Stratusburg Wildfire"
EQS_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Given the long history of pegasi working in tandem with ground forces, designs for a battlefield support aircraft were quickly drawn up and assigned to the Stratusburg branch of the Wonderbolt Design Bureau. The Wildfire did prove effective in the few instances where it was deployed in the Great War, but was not produced in large numbers due to early changeling dominance in the skies rendering close air support infeasible."
