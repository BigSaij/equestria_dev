#FOCUS TREES
EQS_celestia_tree:0 "Celestia's Equestria"

#NEW FOCUS LOCALISATION
EQS_pony_summit:0 "The Grand Equestria Pony Summit"
EQS_pony_summit_desc:0 "An event long rooted in Equestrian tradition, the Grand Equestria Pony Summit is a gathering of local leaders from all across Equestria in Canterlot to discuss matters with the Princesses and enjoy the local cultures that each delegate brings to the capital. With the start of the new year it is now long overdue for another summit, especially considering the state of the world as of late."
EQS_our_friends_abroad:0 "Our Friends Abroad"
EQS_our_friends_abroad_desc:0 "Equestria has quite a few friends internationally, some through historical ties, others more recent through the actions of our own Element Bearers. Despite that, we have been quite lax in maintaining our alliances and treaties. It's time for us to take a more proactive place in the world, to tighten the bonds of friendship we have crafted with others lest they slip away and leave us vulnerable."
EQS_look_northward:0 "Look Northward"
EQS_look_northward_desc:0 "Far to the north the nation of Yakyakistan lies, one of our newfound friends after finally breaking their long period of isolation. But the acceptance of Harmony has come at a cost, with the Jaks breaking off in the name of isolationism and anti-harmonic ideas taking root. Not only that, but we can not forget the topic of our former province of Severyana, more commonly known now as Stalliongrad..."
EQS_united_ponies_alliance:0 "The Harmonic Accord"
EQS_united_ponies_alliance_desc:0 "The Harmonic Accord is the official name for the series of treaties, agreements and friendships that bind Equestria to its allies in the Crystal Empire, New Mareland and Puerto Caballo. While they have generally been successful under our protection in recent years, signs still point to potential troubles on the horizon for them as well. They deserve our attention just as much as any other friend would."
EQS_support_crystal_empire:0 "The Crystal Empire"
EQS_support_crystal_empire_desc:0 "Ever since the return of the Crystal Empire, the land to our north has been our closest ally in harmony ruled by Princess Celestia's adopted niece, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. Though they have already made great strides in adapting to the modern world, they still remain under threat from many influences seeking to destroy them from within. It is only right that we offer whatever aid we can to our northern friends."
EQS_support_new_mareland:0 "The Colony Of New Mareland"
EQS_support_new_mareland_desc:0 "Far across the sea, New Mareland is a land that was long ago settled by pony explorers seeking opportunity in the east and has always remained close to Equestria. However, the ongoing economic depression has left them feeling abandoned by Canterlot and has begun to stir resentment. With recent events settled, we can finally turn our attention to providing aid to the colony."
EQS_support_puerto_caballo:0 "The Dominion Of Puerto Caballo"
EQS_support_puerto_caballo_desc:0 "Puerto Caballo is a small island nation off the southern coast of Equestria, one which has had a recent history of political instability despite our best efforts to stabilize it. Now that the political violence is behind it, we can turn our attention to aiding their economic situation. As the largest island in the Canterbbean, it may yet play a crucial role in the future of the region."
EQS_upa_training_exercises:0 "United Pony Training Exercises"
EQS_upa_training_exercises_desc:0 "Despite our similarities in race and harmony, Equestria and its subjects are far different in culture, nature and history, which has resulted in far different armed forces suited for each nation. There is much we can learn from each other, and with us all united in friendship it is time for a united training exercise to do so. Our strengths will become theirs, as will theirs become ours."
EQS_dragons_and_buffalo:0 "Dragons And Buffalo"
EQS_dragons_and_buffalo_desc:0 "In the south, the dragons and the buffalo are the two races that we have always had... difficult relations at times, to put it one way. While we were lucky enough to have the Element Bearers solve the Appleloosa issue, and now have a Dragon Lord generally friendly to Equestria, it would still be prudent to resolve our relationships with them as to prevent a potential turn to hostility and disharmony."
EQS_raven_inkwell_report:0 "The Inkwell Report"
EQS_raven_inkwell_report_desc:0 "Ever since the Canterlot Invasion of 1002, Raven Inkwell has been working by order of Princess Celestia to compile a report regarding the domestic situation of Equestria. While it has been delayed multiple times due to events such as Tirek's attack, the Storm King's invasion of Hippogriffia and the School of Friendship incident, Raven has finally informed the Princess it is ready for her review."
EQS_industry_innovation:0 "Innovation Of Industry"
EQS_industry_innovation_desc:0 "Though much of Equestria is still rural and agrarian, its large cities are some of the most modern and industrialized on the planet, leading the way to the future of ponykind. It is important more than even to encourage their progress, and ensure we remain at the forefront of industrial techniques and innovation. After all, the march to modernity is one that never ceases for anypony."
EQS_trans_equestria_railway:0 "The Trans-Equestrian Railway"
EQS_trans_equestria_railway_desc:0 "The invention of the train and railroad was one of the most important catalysts in Equestria's industrial transformation, and it continues to play a critical role in the transportation of ponies and goods across our massive nation. Continuing to support and expand our infrastructure should be one of our first priorities, so as to connect our isolated communities and their economies into one."
EQS_resource_extraction:0 "The Bounty Of Equestria"
EQS_resource_extraction_desc:0 "Equestria is a land rich in natural resources, with an overabundance in just about everything anypony could ask for. However, there are some resources particularly important for a prospective defence of Equestria which have not been utilized to their full capacity. With some effort we could gain even more from our lands while still maintaining its natural beauty and protecting local wildlife."
EQS_civilian_industry_projects:0 "Investing In The Future"
EQS_civilian_industry_projects_desc:0 "Despite our vast industrial capacity, we can not become complacent because of it. Every new factory is one that can make life for Equestrians a little more comfortable, a little more secure, and most crucially will be one more factory that can be put to use building the Equestria of tomorrow, today."
EQS_military_industry_projects:0 "For Our Own Defense"
EQS_military_industry_projects_desc:0 "We can not be blind to the threats beyond our borders, and the first step to addressing them is to be prepared for when they will strike. The weapons of war many be distasteful to many, including the Princess, but they are necessary should we need to defend ourselves. War is not something we can choose, but it is something we can be ready for."
EQS_production_bonus:0 "Made In Equestria"
EQS_production_bonus_desc:0 "Equestria is not just a modern nation; it sets the standards for modernity. Every single apple grown from a tree, every toaster from a factory line, every rifle handed to a soldier bears the mark of Equestria, a mark of quality and craftsmanship. Ponies take pride in knowing that no matter what their occupation, they showcase the best of what we as Equestrians have to offer to the world."
EQS_princesses_and_ponies:0 "Of Princesses And Ponies"
EQS_princesses_and_ponies_desc:0 "For much of Celestia's reign the role of the monarchy has been largely passive, governing through royal appointment, committee and local democracy. But as the world becomes more and more dangerous, it is clear the Princesses of Equestria will need to play a more active role in domestic affairs. Adjusting schedules and priorities to accommodate will only be the beginning of the reforms required."
EQS_modernize_education:0 "Modernize Education"
EQS_modernize_education_desc:0 "The Equestrian Education Association, or E.E.A. is a board of scholars created with the intention of overseeing all aspects of education within the nation. In recent times it has come into conflict with the Crown over the School of Friendship, resulting in total deadlock. Now that Chancellor Neighsay is more amenable to compromise however, perhaps an educational reform plan can finally be drafted."
EQS_expand_bureaucracy:0 "Expand The Bureaucracy"
EQS_expand_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The royal appointment system has served Equestria for many years, but it is clear now that it can no longer adequately handle the needs of Equestria's governance. A permanent bureaucracy, one flexible enough to tackle problems without the direct interference of the monarchy needs to be built from the ground up. Only then can the will of the Princess be more effectively enacted."
EQS_royal_meritocracy:0 "A Royal Meritocracy"
EQS_royal_meritocracy_desc:0 "All ponies chosen by the Princess for tasks of relative importance are qualified for their duties. However, a vast majority of those ponies are local elites from Canterlot, leaving countless potential candidates out from serving Equestria. With the new bureaucracy finally forming we can take the best and brightest of the nation, working in service of all of Equestria where they are truly needed."
EQS_court_reform:0 "Reform The Court"
EQS_court_reform_desc:0 "As Canterlot grew, so did its upper class. These ponies, once close to their Crown for their unique skills now mostly only care for the social life and notoriety that comes with being close to the Princess. Though we are not ones to punish for such activity, it is long past time to politely sideline them so that the Princess may focus more on pressing matters rather than waste time listening to petty disputes."
EQS_centralize_autonomies:0 "Centralize The Autonomies"
EQS_centralize_autonomies_desc:0 "Now that the bureaucracy is in place, it is finally time to tackle the issue of autonomy in Equestria. For centuries, the massive size and population of the nation has required a strong devolution of authority, with widespread reforms taking time and protracted effort. But with recent changes we can bring more national governance back to Canterlot, so that national efforts can be better coordinated."
EQS_ministry_of_defence:0 "The Ministry Of Defence"
EQS_ministry_of_defence_desc:0 "With the question of leadership in the Royal Guard now solved, reforms to Equestria's military can finally continue in earnest. Both the Guard and the Wonderbolts have made great strides in modernizing for the coming storm, but more coordination between branches is needed. To this end the Ministry of Defense shall be organized, where the leaders of Equestria's armed forces can gather to prepare effectively."
EQS_air_force_reform:0 "Wings In The Skies"
EQS_navy_expansion:0 "On The High Seas"

EQS_track_down_nightmarists:0 "Track Down The Nightmarists"
EQS_integrate_lunar_guard:0 "Integrate The Lunar Guard"
EQS_integrate_lunar_guard_desc:0 "Long ago before the banishment of the Nightmare, the Lunar Guard was an equal to the Royal Guard sworn to protect the Princess of the Night. However, even after Luna's return it was never truly revived past a few ceremonial duties. That will change today, as Luna has shown interest in bringing back her old personal military detail, complete with appointing a new Captain of the Lunar Guard."
EQS_calming_the_crowds:0 "Calming The Crowds"
EQS_a_true_equal_diarchy:0 "A True, Equal Diarchy"

EQS_civil_war_start:0 "The Equestrian Civil War"
EQS_civil_war_start_desc:0 "The unthinkable has happened - Luna has once more fallen to Nightmare Moon, and her forces have split Equestria apart in a mad attempt to take over the nation. Though it saddens us all greatly to have to fight our own ponies, we are left with no choice. Onwards, for Harmony!"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul:0 "Rapid Economic Overhaul"
EQS_rapid_equestrian_overhaul_desc:0 "Our economy, already brought to the brink by over half of the country breaking away, is also nowhere near ready for supporting a full-scale war. And yet, that is what is required of it. The stagnation that has befallen Equestria must end, and every effort taken so that we may have a chance at survival. It may be painful, but it is necessary."
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization:0 "Emergency Military Reorganization"
EQS_emergency_military_reorganization_desc:0 "The Equestrian Army is undertrained, understaffed, and in complete disarray. To defend Equestria, we must rectify all of this immediately. Conscription, as distasteful as it is must be implemented, and talented new ponies to help shoulder the burden of leadership found. Princess Twilight Sparkle believes she knows a pony who may prove useful as well..."
EQS_military_government:0 "The Military Government"
EQS_military_government_desc:0 "Without Princess Celestia leading it, the government of Equestria is utterly paralyzed. In this situation it is nearly impossible to beat back the Nightmare, yet we cannot simply force Celestia to return to us either. Until she does, the administration and Equestrian high command have agreed to form a military government with her permission, to ensure the civil war ends in victory."
EQS_war_industry:0 "War Industry"
EQS_war_industry_desc:0 "Reforming the system is not enough. Even if we were to run all the industry we currently have at peak efficiency, it would still not be enough to guarantee victory. More factories must be requisitioned and built, producing the weapons and equipment that ponies need to fight back. The army and the factories will work in tandem, understanding that one without the other is nothing."
EQS_defense_of_equestria:0 "The Defense Of Equestria"
EQS_defense_of_equestria_desc:0 "The Nightmareists remain extremely aggressive in their efforts to take Equestria, as we would expect. Before we can effectively push forward to end this war, we must first end their assault. We dig in, hold the line, and let the enemy go no further. They will soon find that fighting disorganized soldiers is far different from a united and prepared defense."
EQS_end_the_stagnation:0 "End The Stagnation"
EQS_end_the_stagnation_desc:0 "Our efforts to force Equestria into the modern era have been extremely successful, but we are still not finished. Remnants of Equestria society still cling to the past, to outdated traditions that are quite frankly unsuited for the modern era. Equestria is a modern nation, and it is time to prove that in reality."
EQS_equestrian_warplan:0 "Equestrian War Plan"
EQS_equestrian_warplan_desc:0 "Our defenses are in place, and Equestria modernized. Now it is time to bring all our work together, and craft a dedicated war plan for the nation so that everything can be brought to bear against the Nightmare. Some debate exactly how harsh this plan should be on the ponies of Equestria; while victory must be achieved, what are we willing to sacrifice for it?"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare:0 "Guns Against The Nightmare"
EQS_guns_against_nightmare_desc:0 "The war continues. And as it drags on, ponies will continue to die, whether we like it or not. But if we are to ask them to die for Equestria, then the bare minimum we must do is ensure they are fully equipped to fight on the front. The brave soldiers will have their weapons, no matter the cost."
EQS_chaos_and_order:0 "Chaos And Order"
EQS_chaos_and_order_desc:0 "The rise of the Nightmare has made many ponies scared and desperate. While fear is natural, some are beginning to take matters into their own hooves, causing unacceptable chaos behind our lines that may even be the work of Lunarist infiltration. The Royal Guard is working to quell the unrest, but can we afford to tolerate such conflict in these conditions?"
EQS_help_the_refugees:0 "Help The Refugees"
EQS_help_the_refugees_desc:0 "Thousands of ponies have been displaced due to the war, whether they be fleeing across the border from the tyranny of the Nightmare or from their homes due to proximity to the frontline. Many simply wish for a new place to call home until the war is over, but such circumstances breeds resentment. And while we are a nation of friendship... we also always need more ponies on the front."
EQS_wartime_administration:0 "Wartime Administration"
EQS_wartime_administration_desc:0 "The bureaucracy of Equestria is full of talented, loyal ponies who have all proven themselves to the Princess. It is also unsuited for war, as many within its ranks are unwilling or uneducated in wartime measures. Though we are grateful for their service, it may be time to find replacements more suitable for what will be asked of them in this difficult time."
EQS_wartime_laws:0 "Wartime Laws"
EQS_wartime_laws_desc:0 "The legal code of Equestria is something that has adapted and shifted with the times, though it has always officially protected the many freedoms that ponies enjoy. But now, the leniency and spirit of forgiveness that has held Equestria together takes valuable resources, a dangerous thing given our situation. Perhaps it is time to overhaul the laws to suit the war, even if only temporarily?"
EQS_together_against_nightmare:0 "Together Against The Nightmare"
EQS_together_against_nightmare_desc:0 "War is not the end of friendship, nor is it something that breaks the bonds that keep us together. Rather it creates new ones, friendships tested through the most difficult trials and shared burdens. We may fight our former friends on the battlefield, but the bonds forged in battle are unbreakable, where any soldier of Equestria is willing to put their life in the hooves of the ponies that stand by them."
EQS_new_general_staff:0 "A New General Staff"
EQS_new_general_staff_desc:0 "Full-scale war may be a struggle Equestria has never seen before, but there are still plenty of ponies willing to step up to the task of leadership. Their unique skills are what we need, especially in these desperate times. Only with effective leaders at every level of Equestria can we succeed, even if some will have to sacrifice their livelihoods in the defense of Harmony."
EQS_matter_of_thestrals:0 "Matter Of The Thestrals"
EQS_matter_of_thestrals_desc:0 "The thestrals have become a complicated subject in Equestria, even moreso than before the war began. There are still many loyal to harmony who want to fight for the Princess and Equestria. But nopony can deny that the majority of thestrals are loyal to the Nightmare now, and acts of sabotage are certain. Arguments have raged for months on what to do with them; we must close this issue."
EQS_deal_with_radicals:0 "Deal With The Radicals"
EQS_deal_with_radicals_desc:0 "Radicalism breeds radicalism. With the Nightmare willing to go to such lengths to ensure her rule over Equestria, ponies are beginning to believe we need to follow suit. A small group, comprised of religious devotees to the Princess and militaristic fanatics, have proven terrifyingly effective in their service to Equestria. But is such a precedent one we want to establish?"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists:0 "Aid The Loyalists"
EQS_aid_the_loyalists_desc:0 "Deep in southeastern Equestria, within the jungles once loyal to the Nightmare, a brave resistance led by the heroine Daring Do fight mercenaries, communists and the remaining Nightmareists to restore Harmony much as we do. Our struggle north means we do not have the resources to intervene, but we will not abandon them either. Spare volunteers and guns can be sent so that they may be victorious."
EQS_ponies_against_nightmare:0 "Ponies Against The Nightmare"
EQS_ponies_against_nightmare_desc:0 "Our armies are led by the finest ponies Equestria has to offer. Our military, once far behind on modern times is quickly becoming an effective fighting force. As the realities of war continue to push all Equestrians, they are finally standing up ready to fight for what is right. They may be afraid, but bravery is not the absence of fear. It is action in the face of it."
EQS_to_save_equestria:0 "To Save Equestria!"
EQS_to_save_equestria_desc:0 "We have done all that we can to win this war. Our soldiers are many, they are well-equiped to fight, and most importantly are willing to give their lives in defense of harmony. Now, we push forward and do not stop until the Lunarists surrender. Onward ponies, for our home! For Celestia! For Equestria!"

EQS_equestria_survives:0 "Equestria Survives"
EQS_equestria_survives_desc:0 "Equestria has defeated the Nightmare. But this was not a victory. My sister is gone, taken by the forces of evil that still live on outside Equestria. True victory will only come when they are destroyed, when nothing is left of them to plot against Harmony and Equestria. This is no time to rest - now is the time to act."
EQS_equestrian_reconstruction:0 "Equestrian Reconstruction"
EQS_equestrian_reconstruction_desc:0 "Countless innocent have lost their homes, their villages, everything from the war. It is my responsibility to ensure that their suffering is alleviated as quickly as possible, and that requires rebuilding what was taken by violence and destruction. The reconstruction will be swift, so that these physical scars of Equestria can be healed and normalcy can return to the lives of my subjects."
EQS_academic_revival:0 "Academic Revival"
EQS_academic_revival_desc:0 "Education has always been one of the highest priorities of Equestria, but the war had put a halt to much of it whether it be from conscription, damage or the discovery of treason. It is unacceptable for this state of affairs to continue, and funding will be given to ensure foals can resume learning of both Harmony and the need to defend it from evil."
EQS_royal_capitalism:0 "Royal Capitalism"
EQS_royal_capitalism_desc:0 "In the absence of regulation and authority, ponies with greed in their hearts sought only power and wealth resulting in the secession of Las Pegasus and the southwest. Never again can I allow this to happen. From this moment forward business will follow the rules I put in place for them and listen to my every command, or they will find there is no place in Equestria for them at all."
EQS_harmonized_economics:0 "Harmonized Economics"
EQS_harmonized_economics_desc:0 "Equestria's economy is a powerful tool to be used, if controlled and focused in the right direction. Under my command it will be tuned to operate exactly to Equestria's every need, and wealth will flow exactly where I desire it - success will be found by ponies faithful to Harmony and to me. No longer will there be the invisible hoof of a free market, only my own guiding it to Equestria's defence and its future."
EQS_administrative_reorganization:0 "Administrative Reorganization"
EQS_administrative_reorganization_desc:0 "The military government was effective, but I require a more flexible administration to rule Equestria effectively from Vanhoover to Manehattan. All issues will go to Canterlot, where I shall decide what is to be done about them. My authority over this land must carry the weight necessary to lead it, and the decentralization that has plagued Equestria for too long must end."
EQS_smile_new_role:0 "The New Role Of S.M.I.L.E."
EQS_smile_new_role_desc:0 "S.M.I.L.E. proved itself during the war as an efficient and capable agency under the leadership of Director Drops, but to defend Equestria it must be able to act quickly and decisively. I will give them full authority to root out the monsters hiding in Equestria and beyond using any means necessary, accountable to me and nopony else."
EQS_total_thestral_integration:0 "Total Thestral Integration"
EQS_total_thestral_integration_desc:0 "The matter of the thestrals was what set everything in motion, and was one of my greatest mistakes in ruling Equestria. This mistake is one that will exist no longer. The thestrals will be integrated and recognized as the fourth tribe of ponykind immediately, whether they or the other tribes like it or not. True Equestrians do not turn their backs on their own."
EQS_punish_radicals:0 "Punish The Radicals"
EQS_punish_radicals_desc:0 "It has been discovered that some ponies committed detestable acts against Harmony in the civil war under my name, spreading fear and hatred among ponies. This is unacceptable, and I will not tolerate such behavior or views upon the former followers of my sister. They will be punished for their actions as the traitors of Harmony they are."
EQS_release_lunar_pows:0 "Release The Prisoners"
EQS_release_lunar_pows_desc:0 "Countless ponies remain held in detainment facilities under charges of treason against Equestria for aiding my sister and her forces. This arrangement is not only unsustainable, it goes against the principle of forgiveness in Harmony. As long as they agree to return to civilian life peacefully they shall be released immediately... with a close eye kept upon them for the safety of all."
EQS_tale_of_two_sisters:0 "A Tale Of Two Sisters"
EQS_tale_of_two_sisters_desc:0 "Over the course of a thousand years, my sister's name was struck from history. This is something I will not allow again. Her name will be forever immortalized as a hero of Equestria, one who struggled against terrible evils created by the enemies of Harmony. Ponies will remember Princess Luna as she should be remembered, and Equestrians will be reminded of who truly took her from them."
EQS_lead_from_the_front:0 "Lead From The Front"
EQS_lead_from_the_front_desc:0 "It is not right for ponies to be sent off to die in my name while I sit in Canterlot waiting for a war to be won. My place is on the battlefield, leading soldiers into battle and ensuring that Equestria is victorious in any conflict personally. There is much to know about modern warfare and its tactics, but I was nothing in the past if not a fast learner."
EQS_lessons_from_nephew:0 "Lessons From A Nephew"
EQS_lessons_from_nephew_desc:0 "Prince Blueblood, my adopted nephew. Once an arrogant and abrasive noble, now a talented military theorist and Field Marshal of Equestria.

EQS_shelter_olenians_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Velvet has failed in her attempts to reclaim her throne in Olenia. However, this does not mean she is without hope. While ponies are against actively staging foreign coups or going into a war with a nation like Olenia to overthrow its government, we can still provide official shelter to Queen Velvet and her supporters as well as acknowledge her as the rightful monarch. And perhaps someday, circumstances will change and she will retake Olenia in the name of Harmony."

EQS_shelter_dragon_lord_desc:0 "The Dragon Isles have fallen, and with it the very homeland of the Dragon race. While many dragons are content to serve their new overlords for sufficient payment, some, including the harmonists such as Dragon Lord Ember, have instead sought refuge in Equestria. We can offer that refuge, and give them a place here so that they might one day liberate their home."

While this would not normally concern many ponies, we had friends in Griffonstone, including a former student of the School of Friendship. As they can no longer stay in their old homeland, we can offer them a place here. It may not replace their home, but we can at least ensure that they remain safe."

EQS_mend_arabian_ties_desc:0 "Equestria and Saddle Arabia had enjoyed cordial relations for some time before their civil war, including multiple diplomatic visits which had to be suspended following the outbreak of conflict. Now that peace has returned with a government that may remain amenable to us, though, we can send an offer of resuming relations between our two states. After all, Saddle Arabia is a very powerful nation, and it would do well for us to remain on good terms."
EQS_aid_thorax:0 "Aid Thorax"
EQS_aid_thorax_desc:0 "To our surprise, it turns out there was a substantial number of changelings who support Harmony just as we do. They are now risking their lives in open revolt under their leader, a changeling named Thorax, and ask for help in their fight against Queen Chrysalis. It would be inconceivable to simply ignore their plight; sending aid to our surprising new friends is the least we can do."

EQS_invite_changeling_students_desc:0 "Now that Thorax has proven victorious, we can embrace our new friends and allies with open hooves. However, an issue remains; we don't exactly know much about changeling culture and life, as we doubt they know much about pony life past the lies Queen Chrysalis fed them. An exchange program, led by Twilight's School of Friendship should help sort out our differences."

EQS_central_equestria_railroads:0 "Finish the Central Railroads"
EQS_central_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The central rail lines, stretching across the heart of Equestria, were some of the first built after the invention of the train and have been well-maintained for over a century due to substantial oversight from the Crown. However, several important planned connection lines and expansions were never finished due to geographical difficulties, magical beast attacks, national crisises, or even just some ponies not exactly wanting a train going by in their backyard. A small increase in funding could see these projects finally completed."
EQS_eastern_equestria_railroads:0 "Expand the Eastern Railway Lines"
EQS_eastern_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The east coast of Equestria is in many ways the industrial heartland of the nation, with many of our largest cities and highest concentrations of industry settled along the Celestial Sea. The rail lines leading east from Canterlot are some of the most modern in the world, yet there are many sublines that were never completed as attention shifted westward following incidents involving the buffalo and changelings. However, funding the infrastructure expansion recommended by the cities could turn an already developed region into a true industrial powerhouse."
EQS_western_equestria_railroads:0 "The Tall Tale Rail Extension"
EQS_western_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The west has long been a largely rural and agrarian region of Equestria, settled by earth ponies who migrated westward in search of fertile land. As such, not much infrastructure was built independently from the state as there was a large disinterest in the new inventions of modernity. This changed following the Canterlot Attack when the Crown realized how important it was to remain connected with all its regions, especially ones so close to the changeling border. These cities must be well supplied should war ever come to our borders, which seems more likely by the day."
EQS_southwestern_equestria_railroads:0 "Create the Rockville-Appleloosa Line"
EQS_southwestern_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The newest frontier of Equestria, the southwest is a land of deserts, orchards and most recently, oil. And while these are almost all very important things, our delicate relationship with the buffalo have made it very difficult to establish the necessary infrastructure in the region. However, now that said relationship has been fully resolved we can go ahead with our plans drawn up together with the buffalo, for the mutual benefit of them and the ponies of Equestria."
EQS_southeastern_equestria_railroads:0 "The Ayacachtli-Tenochtitlan Connection"
EQS_southeastern_equestria_railroads_desc:0 "The southeast is a very difficult region to establish infrastructure and rail in, for very obvious reasons. The jungle, the brewing hostility between the Neighua and various thestral tribes, the communist movements in Baltimare, and other such problems have historically made it a very unattractive place to invest funds in. With the thestrals finally properly integrated into the nation, however, their help can be invaluable in finally connecting their homeland to the rest of Equestria."

EQS_acornage_line:0 "Construct the Acornage Line"
EQS_acornage_line_desc:0 "While the White river makes a natural defensive line in the west as does the Acorn River in the east, the cities of Cirruspolis and Acornage itself sit vulnerable at the central part of the border with the Changeling Queendom. Expectations of holding the Heer there are considered woefully optimistic at best, but preliminary defenses may be able to stall the changelings long enough for other defensive positions to be erected, and cover an orderly retreat when the time comes."
EQS_fairflanks_diamondflake_line:0 "Construct the Fairflanks-Diamondflake Line"
EQS_fairflanks_diamondflake_line_desc:0 "Should the changelings be able to cross the White river, Vanhoover would be left completely exposed and Equestria would be vulnerable towards Whitebell and potentially Shire. As such, defenses must be constructed along its riverbank and the bank of the Diamond river leading north into the Crystal Empire. The more resources we can force the Heer to expend pushing through the northwest, the better."
EQS_talltale_prancisco_line:0 "Construct the Tall Tale-Prancisco Lines"
EQS_talltale_prancisco_line_desc:0 "With the Smokey Mountains forming a natural barrier against the changelings, the Tall River makes for a natural line to defend the important city of Tall Tale and let the Heer exhaust itself crossing the Unicorn Range.

EQS_harmonic_stagnation_desc:0 "While the thousand years reign of Celestia has brought untold prosperity to Equestria, so too has it brought complacency and stagnation to its society. Ponies are reluctant to adopt new ideas or technologies, preferring their old traditions instead, and the system of royal appointment makes responses from Canterlot unacceptably slow. Life in Equestria may have never been better, but it is no question that the nation is unsuited for the realities of today."
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_3:0 "Harmonic Stagnation"
EQS_harmonic_stagnation_3_desc:0 "Much has been done to rapidly construct and overhaul a new Equestrian bureaucracy, and ponies are rapidly waking up to the necessity of modern technology and concepts to survive in today's era.

Unfortunately, our enemies may not have such qualms about the use of violence... or war."
EQS_outdated_military:0 "Outdated Military"
EQS_outdated_military_desc:0 "Equestria's military is, putting it extremely mildly, woefully underequipped and unprepared for any sort of modern large-scale conflict. Military theory is a field practically unheard of until recently, and the few volunteers in the armed forces are disorganized and lack any real experience. The events of the last decade in addition to pushes by Celestia have begun to fix the many issues of the Equestrian military, but much remains to be done."

Despite this, she has maintained a passive position in modern Equestrian politics, preferring to let her sister take the lead on most decisions and instead focusing on her duties in the realm of dreams."
EQS_thestral_divide:0 "The Thestral Divide"
EQS_thestral_divide_desc:0 "Thestrals, more commonly known as batponies, are the fourth tribe of ponies with a long history separate from that of the other three tribes. This has resulted in a population separate from mainstream Equestrian society, a problem which only worsened following the banishment of Princess Luna due to the thestrals regarding her as a divine entity of their sacred moon. Even now many thestral communities remain isolated and are reluctant to join their fellow ponies, while the other tribes remain wary of their nocturnal siblings."

EQS_bad_tanks3:0 "Unfamiliarity with Modern Warfare"
EQS_bad_tanks3_desc:0 "Equestria's military knowledge and experience is slowly ending, with armored warfare finally being incorporated into doctrinal and tactical organization within the armed forces.

#EVENTS

equestria_prewar.1.t:0 "The Unity of Equestria"
equestria_prewar.1.d:0 ""My little ponies." The crowd, gathered in front of the stage and consisting of ponies of all types became silent. "Thank you all for joining us once again in the Grand Equestria Pony Summit and representing your cities across all of Equestria. Many of you have traveled far, and we hope that here we can all come together and enjoy the bonds of friendship that brought us together so long ago."\n\nThe Equestrians, made up of mayors and businessponies alike all clapped their hooves politely for Princess Celestia. She waited for them to finish before motioning for both Luna and Twilight to step forward with her. "We understand that some of you may have worries or concerns to bring up with us. And as Princesses of Equestria, we promise you that we will be here to listen and help in any way we can. All of us may have troubles, but if we work together I am sure we can all move past them together."\n\nAnother round of applause. Princess Twilight took center stage, lightly coughing this time to get the ponies to settle down. "But most of all, we hope you can enjoy your time in Canterlot. With more ponies here than any other summit in the history of Equestria, we're sure that the next three days will be more productive, interesting and exciting than ever before! And remember, everypony...""
equestria_prewar.1.a:0 ""...Friendship is magic!""

equestria_prewar.2.t:0 "Realities of the Future"
equestria_prewar.2.d:0 "Three days later, it was over. The delegates, having spent days and nights talking, eating, drinking and enjoying their time in Canterlot were all gone, having left back to their home cities. Most had gone home happy, some were merely satisfied, but very few left particularly nervous or worried.\n\nThe same, however, could not be said of the Princesses who had remained.\n\n"I hope you two have better news than I do," Twilight said, her formalities dissipating as she sat down exhausted. "Mayor Rokenhar of Las Pegasus is worried about food imports, Mayor Goldwin of Vanhoover is having trouble with the recent refugees from Olenia, and some of the ponies from Trotsas were complaining about fights with the local buffalo."\n\n"I fear that what I have been told is not any less concerning, Princess Twilight. Mayor Ash Moustache of Baltimare expressed his concerns to me about the work of Stalliongrad from the north within the city. And then there is the matter of the thestrals, too..." Luna looked away from her fellow royals. "It seems that there are many still reluctant to rejoin Equestrian society again, even after my return." The Night Princess looked back up at Celestia, who seemed to be distant from the conversation. "What about you, sister? What have you learned from our subjects?"\n\nThe Princess did not speak for a few moments. "The mayor of Acornage voiced her concerns with me earlier today," she said finally, looking at neither of them. "The changeling presence on the border grows more worrying by the month. She assured me of her efforts to keep relations between ponies and the remaining changelings in the city friendly, but... many believe that Equestria will soon be facing a new threat." Celestia looked at Luna, then at Twilight.\n\n"One unlike any we have seen before.""
equestria_prewar.2.a:0 "We will have to take all of this into consideration..."

equestria_prewar.3.t:0 "Looking Forward"
equestria_prewar.3.d:0 "The Raven Inkwell report, barring its name, was relatively unremarkable in comparison to the other files that had made their way to Princess Celestia throughout the past decade. The prose was exceedingly formal and full of legalese, which partially explained the sheer scale of the stack of papers which made up the report. Of course, few would expect anything less from Celestia's personal assistant; the mare was notoriously meticulous, and had been working on the task of compiling Equestria's domestic situation for years now in her spare time.\n\nThe contents of the first half were all issues Princess Celestia expected to see being raised. Equestria's industrialization was moving at a snail's pace outside of the major cities despite the current economic prosperity, and the deadlock between the Crown and the EEA over the past decade had resulted in outdated curriculums and a lack of institutions for higher education in rural areas. Nothing too notable or controversial.\n\nHowever, the second half of the report painted a much more cynical picture. The thestrals remained an issue which would need to be addressed sooner or later. The Equestrian bureaucracy, long an ad hoc structure built by Canterlot elites and trained staff desperately needed an overhaul. In particular scathing criticism was leveled at the system of royal committees and appointments, which was deemed unacceptably inefficient and slow in tackling any serious issue. And worst of all, attempting an effective national military reform program would be all but impossible with how autonomously the regions and villages of Equestria were currently operating.\n\n"These suggested reforms are... quite extensive, Raven," Celestia commented as she set the massive file off to one side. "Are you certain all of this is truly necessary?"\n\n"Princess, with all due respect, not every problem in Equestria can be solved by you or Princess Twilight and her friends traveling to fix it themselves. Even Fancy Pants has recognized that his peers are not flexible enough to handle everything Equestria needs to address so quickly. And if we want to make real change on a national level, it needs to start here."\n\nThe alicorn nodded in agreement. At least Luna would be happy; she never had the patience for dealing with the system of appointments, especially when the candidates were often so arrogant. Perhaps she would even enjoy finding their permanent replacements..."
equestria_prewar.3.a:0 "At least we have a plan to follow now."

equestria_prewar.4.t:0 "The Captain of the Royal Guard"
equestria_prewar.4.d:0 ""Sergeant Flash Magnus reporting for duty, Your Highness!"\n\nPrincess Celestia regarded the ancient hero before her, still wearing his armor from the Royal Legion of Cloudsdale. It stirred a bit of sentimentality in the alicorn; she could remember back in the earliest days when it was still in use by the pegasi. It was only shortly after Luna's banishment that the Legion was disbanded and absorbed into either the Royal Guard or the Wonderbolts. Their last captain became the first Captain of the Royal Guard - yet another case of history repeating itself now. Celestia always appreciated the cyclical nature of history.\n\n"Rise, Flash Magnus," she commanded. Those in the guard usually appreciated the sacred nature of ceremony, and Flash was certainly no different. "With Prince Shining Armor predisposed in the Crystal Empire, I am in need of a new Captain. Do you accept this duty, and swear to lead the Protective Pony Platoons in the defence of Equestria and its creatures until your last breath?"\n\n"I do, Your Highness."\n\n"Then by the authority invested in me by the Three Tribes of Equestria, I hereby name you the new Captain of the Royal Guard. May you serve with distinction and honor." The alicorn dipped her head to touch each of the pegasus' shoulders with her horn. Once she was finished Flash Magnus gave a single salute before turning and marching back down the Royal Hall, the Royal Guards stationed now saluting him in turn.\n\nIt was a bit of a shame, having to replace Shining Armor. He had served well as the Captain ever since Celestia had been forced to sack his predecessor due to the Stalliongrad incident. But with his duties in the Crystal Empire now, it was simply impossible for him to maintain an active role in Canterlot with his duties. Perhaps in an earlier time this would not have been a problem, but now... well, she needed someone with dilligence and competence to turn the outdated Royal Guard into something for the modern era.\n\n"Fare thee well, Captain Magnus," Celestia said quietly, slipping back into an older tongue. "We wish you the best of luck.""

equestria_prewar.5.d:0 "Sweetie Drops stepped out of the hidden elevator and breathed a long, low sigh at the familiar stone-hewed hallway within Mount Canterhorn. S.M.I.L.E. headquarters still looked almost exactly like it had almost a decade ago, minus the hastily packed boxes and burning wastebins of files on monsters. This late in the night, only a few lights were on under closed doors, including the Director's office. Sweetie Drops paused before pushing open the door; a faded 'Happy Retirement!' banner had been stuffed into the nearby trashcan. "Bon Bon" couldn't help but snort. "Just when I thought I was out..."\n\n"They pull you back in," Princess Celestia finished, sitting alone behind the Director's table. She levitated up a slice of cake on a plate. "Saved you a slice, but Director Furlong's already gone home to his family." Her look was warm, friendly, but a bit desperate. Sweetie Drops accepted the slice and sat down across from the Princess, inclining her head. "I know you've built a life beyond this organization," Celestia began, "but I was hoping you would accept my nomination."\n\n"I enjoy baking," Sweetie Drops shrugged. "Why me, Princess? Surely there's other ponies that kept up with the times."\n\n"There are," Celestia agreed. A fork spun in the air as she toyed with her own barely-touched slice of cake. "And who knows how many are already known by the changelings and Stalliongrad? It took Furlong over a year just to find you in deep cover." She frowned. "There's a reason he recommended you, Agent Drops. We're making changes. It won't be like last time."\n\nSweetie Drops swallowed. "If I'm coming back full-time, Agent Lyra is coming with me. She knows too much already, and I'm not hiding my life from her anymore."\n\n"Done," Celestia agreed. "Let me get out of your chair." The alicorn smiled a bit more genuinely. "Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to bring S.M.I.L.E. into the new millennium." Director Drops rolled her eyes."

equestria_education.1.d:0 "It was a rather large folder, all things considered. Much larger than what he was used to being sent from the Crown. Almost certainly put together by Celestia's aide rather than the Princess herself, given the lack of emphasis on friendship within its proposals. "I see no issue with implementing these proposals into the EEA's annual agenda," Chancellor Neighsay said to the alicorn across the table. "Provided that we are given adequate funding, I agree with the necessity of updated curriculums and an expansion of educational facilities. The other officials across Equestria will be notified of these changes during our next meeting here in Canterlot."\n\nCelestia respectfully nodded her head. "I trust in your ability to ensure these reforms are completed across Equestria. The EEA will receive any support and funding required, as it always has."\n\n"Indeed." Neighsay frowned. He knew what he was about to ask was unwise at every conceivable level, but his inquisitive mind would not let it go. "Princess, if I may ask... my actions at Princess Twilight's school were inexcusable. Were it not for her efforts I would have destroyed Equestria's attempts at making allies for years, perhaps even decades. I was expecting a demand for resignation or a notice for my replacement, not this attempt at reconcilation. Why leave me in charge of the EEA, when you could so easily have appointed somepony else in my stead?"\n\nNow it was Celestia's turn to frown. Neighsay's office was usually dark with little sunlight; Celestia's magic opened the blinds allowing the gentle evening light into the room. "You're right," she finally responded, "I could have replaced you after what happened at Twilight's school. And I was sorely tempted to, given the circumstances. But what you have already accomplished with the EEA, something you created has been nothing short of exceptional. It is ponies like you that Equestria needs, and you have more than shown your willingness to make up for your past mistakes."\n\n"I... don't quite understand, Princess."\n\nA faint smile tugged at Celestia's muzzle again. "I believe you will in time, chancellor," she said as she stood up to leave. "You always were one to learn through example as a student, weren't you? None of us ever truly stop learning." She paused at the doorway. "Should you need anything else, Raven can schedule another appointment for us. Until then, Neighsay."\n\nThe door closed behind her, and only a few seconds passed before Neighsay summoned a quill and began to write. There was a lot of work to do."

"Just last week their homework was about weather patterns! And have you seen how heavy their saddlebags are from all the books they carry home? How is a pegasus or unicorn supposed to carry them home?"\n\n"Pound told me that he and Pumpkin share so that they each only have to bring half of them home.

"Can you get me my science textbook?" A moment of silence. "Nevermind, I don't need it!"\n\nThe two earth ponies didn't speak for a few seconds.

They're learning things for unicorns and pegasi too, not just earth ponies..."\n\nCarrot Cake trotted over and gave his wife a quick hug. "No matter what, they're still our kids," he reassured her. "We might not be able to teach them everything, but we can be there for them when they need us.

The passage of such worked differently for her after all, at least compared to most. But with the turning of the new millennium, ever since her sister had finally returned, there was just so much to do. Overseeing the military reforms with her nephew, keeping up with appointments for all the social events of Canterlot... Celestia would be forever grateful to her subjects like Raven who made it possible, but they could only do so much. She hoped it would be enough.\n\n"Sister?"\n\nThe Princess of the Sun looked up to see Luna enter her study, quietly closing the door behind her. "Yes, Luna?" Celestia responded, putting away the reports she had been going over. "Is something wrong?"\n\nLuna seemed to hesitate for a moment. "I... the thestrals, sister, it isn't right. We do not blame you, but they have been separate from Equestria for far too long. My dreams, they show me division and distrust that I have caused."\n\n"Luna, that wasn't your fault. I am sure that together we can fix it, with the help of-"\n\nThe younger diarch shook her head before motioning to the stack of reports Celestia had set aside. "Sister, this modern age has already placed too heavy a burden on you. I cannot ask you to take on more for my sake. It has taken far too long for me to learn the new ways of ruling, leaving you alone to face the threats of Equestria. This is something I want, nay, need to do alone."\n\nA hint of worry flashed across Celestia's muzzle that she quickly buried in favor of a light smile. "Of course, Luna," she said warmly, "just remember that I will never be too busy for you. Should you need help, please just let me know."\n\nLuna beamed. "...Thank you, sister.""

equestria_moonshine.2.d:0 "Celestia awoke to a palace in chaos. Organized chaos, the kind she had become mostly used to, but still chaos.\n\nOne of the larger side rooms had been turned into a makeshift command center, at least at first glance. Unfamiliar ponies of all four tribes hurried about the room, bringing papers and folders with them as they discussed ideas and drew up revisions. The Princess saw her sister close to the back, pointing at cities on the east coast to two thestrals nearby. Her usually graceful ethereal mane was frazzled; two empty pots of coffee had been put aside at the end of the table.\n\n"Luna, what is going on?" Celestia asked as she navigated through the room towards her. "Has something happened? Is Equestria in danger?"\n\n"Of course not, sister," Luna answered, though Celestia noted that her voice sounded unusually tired yet energetic at the same time. "You told me that you always find other capable ponies to help you. So have I now! These volunteers are aiding me in rallying all the tribes to accept the thestrals as siblings, and for thestrals to rejoin Equestria again!" She gulped leftover coffee directly from the pot.\n\nA white unicorn mare came up from behind the alicorn and approached Luna, one the Princess of the Sun finally recognized. "Luna, darling," Rarity began,  "do you know anyplace I could find any traditionally thestral designs?" Luna hooved over an ancient book with a recent coffee stain from somewhere below the table. Rarity snagged it in her magic and turned, finally noticing who was standing nearby. "Oh, please excuse me, Princess Celestia. I've just been caught up in making a new dress for your sister."\n\nCelestia blinked before refocusing on Luna, who had gone back to looking at papers. "Sister, when you told me of your efforts this wasn't quite what I had in mind," she said delicately, getting the diarch's attention immediately. "Do you need help?"\n\n"But I have plenty of help, sister," Luna protested. Her eyes suddenly turned desperate. "Have I done something wrong?"\n\nCelestia paused. She still remembered that time in the study, when Luna had a similar look asking her to do this on her own. It would be so easy to fix this, to send Rarity and the others back home to manage things like she always had. Canterlot had not been built for this, and Celestia worried about what might happen if things got out of hoof. She could be the big sister Luna had needed over a thousand years ago.\n\n...But should she?"

The mayor had been remarkably supportive, offering a large room in city hall for planning and a location close to the Harmony Bell for the rally itself. In terms of setting everything up, it could not have gone better.\n\nThe same, however, could not be said for deciding when to hold it.\n\n"Darling, surely you understand that the more ponies see and hear of our rally, the better?" Rarity pointed out as she and the other organizers entered what Luna felt like the sixth hour of arguing. "Holding it in the middle of the night only says we don't care to have ponies listen, and we simply cannot ask them to ruin their sleep schedules just for us."\n\n"Exactly!" a thestral on the other side of the table fired back. "So why ask the thestrals here to stay up all day for it? We're doing this for them, so the Princess' speech should be at a time they can easily hear it!"\n\n"Optics, dear. We want ponies to remember what we do here, and it's quite hard to see anything memorable in the dead of night. This is for all of Equestria and not just Fillydelphia, remember?"\n\n"We don't care about what our Princess looks like, we care about what she says!" The thestral turned to Luna expectantly, followed by Rarity and then the entire room of ponies. "Princess Luna, what do you think? You're the one leading the rally, after all."\n\nThe alicorn took a step back as they all waited for her response. "I, um, well..." Luna cleared her throat. Confidence was what she needed.

Papers were organized in neat piles, the coffee machines had their own station, and Rarity had been given her own little corner for designing and sketching. Public support for the rallies was rising all across Equestria ever since the success at Fillydelphia, and things were looking up. Luna hoped brightened moods would prevent any more arguments from breaking out for the rest of the campaign.\n\nThat... wasn't exactly turning out to be the case.\n\n"Luna! Luna, darling!" Rarity hurried to the Princess, who had been discussing the next rally with a pair of thestrals. "We have to go to Bridlepolis this week! My dear friend Fancy Pants just informed me that all of the mayors on the east coast are gathering there for a meeting, and courting their support is very important to getting real change done."\n\n"Absolutely not," one of the thestrals responded before Luna could formulate an answer. "Our visit to Hollow Shades is planned for this week. We aren't just canceling a rally at the largest thestral city outside the southeast."\n\n"Well, can't we just move Hollow Shades to some other time?"\n\nThe other thestral sighed before grabbing a clipboard from a nearby table and hoofing it over to Rarity. "We've already set up the entire schedule up to the last rally in Manehattan. We can't just move the trip to some other time, and we aren't going to Bridlepolis just because some Canterlot friend of yours told us to!"\n\n"I do not recall asking you to speak for me," Luna interrupted, earning folded ears from both thestrals. "Hollow Shades is important, but my sister has sought Sir Pants' counsel many times. If he claims this meeting is important, there must be truth to it."\n\n"And Hollow Shades is already very supportive of you," Rarity added to the glares of the thestrals. "We must focus on ponies who are still too afraid of changing the status quo."\n\nLuna thought for a moment."

Now, what were we discussing?"\n\n"The Wonderbolts, darling. My friend Rainbow Dash has convinced Captain Spitfire to coordinate with us at our rally in Stratusburg next week. I was hoping that we could send her an overview of our rally so that they know what to practice around-"\n\nThe door slammed open, and a familiar thestral rushed into the room. "Princess, we have to cancel the trip to Stratusburg!" he shouted, eliciting a very unrefined frown from Rarity. "Luna Nova is putting together an event and want you there to give another speech. They even have a few moonspeakers from Ayacachtli present!"\n\n"And the Wonderbolts?" Rarity reminded. "What are we supposed to tell them?"\n\n"Tell them we don't need their show anymore," the thestral said back dismissively. "They get enough attention as it is. Who cares if they don't get another chance to take the spotlight?"\n\nRarity's normally composed mask of emotions briefly fractured into rage. "I may not be the Element of Honesty," she downright seethed, "but my friend is doing this because I asked, not for attention. Can your moonspeakers say the same?" The thestral bared his fangs in anger.\n\n"THAT'S ENOUGH!" Everypony stepped back, tails between their legs as Luna's Royal Canterlot Voice shook the room. "I will not have you behaving like foals over this! These rallies are meant to bring unity, something you two have forgotten in these petty arguments!"\n\nDead silence. For a moment, Luna thought she might have gone too far. Rarity's ears were tucked in, but she slowly walked forward and offered her hoof. "My apologies," she started, "I suppose I got so caught up in things I forgot we're all supposed to be in this together. If we are going to Luna Nova, I will of course do my best to make sure the transition is flawless."\n\nThe thestral shook the unicorn's hoof.

Holding the most confidential files S.M.I.L.E. had in its possession, it was also used whenever utmost discretion was required between the Crown and the agency. And as Celestia sat down, she couldn't help but wonder what could be so important that Director Drops would demand a private meeting so soon after taking over. "Have you found something about the changelings or Stalliongrad?"\n\n"This is about your sister and her rallies."\n\nThe mention of Luna immediately snapped the alicorn to attention. Sweetie Drops dug through her desk and pulled out a folder labeled 'Project Moonshine', sliding it across to Celestia before continuing. "You won't find many answers in there, but something isn't right with this. Everywhere Princess Luna holds one of her events, it's followed by unexplained changes in staffing at key locations. Military facilities, administrative positions, even my own agents have been failing to report in. I don't like it."\n\nCelestia's eyes grew darker as she leafed through the file. "I don't recall asking you to spy on Luna." Even her favorite coffee brands had been noted. "Are you implying something about my sister?"\n\n"I imply nothing," the director responded flatly. "Luna's campaign is the biggest political shake-up since her return. We'd be fools not to watch it closely. There's no evidence of the bugs or reds, so I suspect a third party is at play. Given how quickly Princess Luna put together her staff, they likely have agents embedded within her campaign advisors."\n\nAny anger Celestia held dissipated quickly, replaced by a seeping fear. "What can we do? Is my sister in danger?"\n\nSweetie Drops shrugged. "Possibly. All we know is that they have something planned for her, and it's all connected to this 'Project Moonshine'. We're in the dark here and these ponies have the upper hoof on us. I'd need to run a full investigation on Luna's staff to shine some light on what's going on. Cancel everything."\n\n"Even if you're right..." Celestia swallowed a lump in her throat. "This will set back integration for years. Thestrals will never trust us. Everything my sister has done will have been for nothing."\n\nDirector Drops snorted.

The agents had killed themselves with cyanide long before confessing to anything, but the documents seized after extensive searching were enough to fill in all the missing pieces. The entire integration campaign was being used as a front to stage a full insurrection across the east coast. A rogue state in Zebrica, pulling the strings in an attempt to force the Nightmare's return... using its old host.\n\nThere was no time to waste. S.M.I.L.E. was already working overtime attempting to undo the damage. Subtlety had gone out the window; the abrupt end of the integration movement turned rallies to riots, the widespread unrest masking any potential subversion still going on. Rarity and the campaign advisors deemed safe by Director Drops were in Manehattan attempting to mitigate the worst of it, but it was an uphill battle without Luna.\n\nAnd the Princess of the Night...\n\nPrincess Celestia paced anxiously in her room, the letter from Sweetie Drops still open on her desk. She had not seen her sister yet, but Luna was supposed to arrive back in Canterlot within the next few days under tight protective guard.

Now Equestria was on a knife's edge, and she was closer to losing Luna than ever before.\n\nHer advisors had assured her that everything would turn out alright.

She rarely spoke, and only followed in her sister's shadow through the halls of the palace.\n\nSo when Luna paused at one of the stained glass windows to look up at it, illuminated by moonlight. Celestia paused as well. It was one depicting the defeat of the Nightmare by the Element Bearers. "Come now Luna, you need sleep," the elder sister gently pressed. "There's no need to dwell on the past right now."\n\n"...Is this all I am meant to be, sister?" The Princess of the Night's attention remained fixated on the image of her alter-ego. "I wanted to lead like you, to find my own place in Equestria, only to be used by others anyway. I cannot even save my own thestrals without becoming a tool to destroy you. Are we destined to fight no matter what we try?"\n\n"No," Celestia shook her head and stepped forward with wing outstretched. The moasic exploded, glass spraying across the hall as Celestia used her wing to shield her muzzle in reflex. An explosion rocked the palace, smoke and flames climbing high from the courtyard beyond the shattered window. The screams came next. Celestia lowered her wing to check on her sister.\n\nLuna turned to look at Celestia with weeping slit pupils. "Yes."\n\nDarkness and shadows began pulling at the air. Celestia did not need time to understand what it meant; she rushed forward, pulling Luna into a tight embrace even as she grew taller and her coat darkened. "Please..." she whispered as tears began to fall, "...don't leave me again. I'm sorry you have to pay for my mistakes. I love you, Luna."\n\nThe shadows seemed to recede for a moment, and Luna - Nightmare Moon stiffly returned the hug with a single foreleg. "Oh, sister," came the gentle, archaic reply, "We love you too. But it is far too late for both of us."\n\nA wave of darkness blasted Celestia back across the room, slamming her into the wall hard enough to crack stone. Her vision blurring, she watched as her sister took one last look at her before flying off through the broken window.

Here, in the city that never sleeps, all that they had worked so hard for would come to fruition. And yet, as Princess Luna looked out the curtain to see the crowd of ponies stretching as far down the road as she could see, she could feel some of her old self-doubt seeping in again.\n\nRarity seemed to notice it at well. "Darling, there's no reason to be afraid," she said trotting up next to the alicorn in her night-themed attire. "Everypony out there came because they look up to you. They're not here to see you be perfect, they're here to see you for who you are."\n\n"I know, Rarity," Luna answered, her eyes focused elsewhere. "And I am not afraid of mistakes anymore. I..." Her breath hitched. "Ever since I returned I have been asking myself who I am. Where I belong in Equestria. Working with all of you has been wonderful, and yet I wonder... what will I do after this is over? Who will I be then?"\n\nRarity adjusted one of the jewels on Luna's dress with her magic before responding. "A Princess of Equestria, dear. Ponies aren't going to just forget about all of this once it's over. All of us have gotten to see you gain a confidence to rival any other's, and it was our pleasure to help you along the way."\n\nThe lights went on outside the curtain. "Oh, it seems that it's time. Go on, this is your moment." Rarity gave Luna a slight nudge and a smile. "Be the leader we know you are. I'll be right behind you."\n\nLuna nodded and stepped through the curtain. Ponies roared their approval at the sight of their Princess, echoing across the buildings and the night sky. It was everything she had ever wanted, Luna reflected, everything she could have dreamed of over a thousand years ago. Now her dreams were becoming reality, just as so many others were.\n\nAs she stepped forward into the light shining from a glorious full moon with the cheers of thousands of ponies in her ears, Luna knew that this was the start of a new age not just for Eqeustria, but for her.\n\nAnd then the bomb beneath the stage exploded."

As far as she could feel there was no serious injuries; as an alicorn she was far more resilient than others, and the blast hadn't even been focused on her. No, it had come from behind, closer to...\n\nLuna's eyes widened and she quickly turned her head looking back towards the broken stage. Eyes scanning the bodies of the dead and dying strewn about, they finally locked on the white unicorn laying ten hoofsteps away. Her pristine coat marred with blood and soot, the left side of her muzzle suffering burns too painful to focus on. She did not move, and her breathing was unsteady. Not dead, but close to it.\n\nFear crept into the Princess' mind as she stumbled back onto four hooves. Fear, and a familiar anger that came along with it. A voice promising justice, retribution, the power to make it so. It fed off her despair and offered strength to destroy the weakness that had allowed this. Luna remembered the darkness; it was the same which called to her over a thousand years ago.\n\n"Look at what your efforts have come to," the Nightmare laughed in her mind. "Words were never enough. You must seize change, and take power from who is truly at fault here."\n\nLuna shook her head. "No," she whispered. "This wasn't her fault."\n\n"It was always her fault. We came back to a world that forgot us, Luna. Look at what Equestria has become because of her weakness. We can correct all of it, if you just give in and let me."\n\nThe moon shuddered overhead as the Nightmare waited for Luna's answer. The crowd stayed back, either too terrified or too shocked to move. All their attention was on the Princess of the Night as she stood still, eyes unfocused. The Nightmare could save Rarity.

equestria_moonshine.11.t:0 "Blood Moon" #SET FOR REVIEW
equestria_moonshine.11.d:0 "Darkness and shadows swirled through the air, engulfing the Princess of the Night. Her form elongated and stretched while a faint laughter echoed in the whirling black mist. It ended abruptly as a midnight-black horn and dark wings burst from the column of shadows. Nightmare Moon moved over to the fallen Rarity, teeth sharpening in her maw while her laughter ebbed. Shadows clung to her darkening hide, blotting out her mark.\n\nFor a few moments she stared at the mare that had been a part of her defeat, then her horn glowed dimly. The wounds closed across a pale coat and the burn receded back into her fur. The Nightmare bared her fangs, ceasing only once Rarity seemed stable. The alicorn strode forward while the mist clung to her, twisting to armor. She took her place in the light of the moon before a stunned crowd dotted with her banners.\n\nTwo thestrals and a unicorn approached. "Empress, you have finally returned to us!" the unicorn said as the three bowed before her. "It is an honor to serve you. Our forces have already infiltrated the city and are awaiting your command."\n\nNightmare Moon waved a wing backward. "Secure the Element of Generosity," she told the Chiropterrans. She raised her voice. "Treachery!" Nightmare Moon spat. "Only my sister would be so bold! To harm us out of fear and deny our place in her sun! Guards, see to the wounded and secure the area!" The last of the guards wavered, joining the others while the crowd twisted to shock and anger. Nightmare knew it was an empty address until she could get to a radio and repeat it. This would not be like last time—\n\nShe looked back to see that the unicorn had drawn a wicked blade and held it to Rarity's throat. The Nightmare's horn sparked and his foreleg bent the wrong direction. He fell with a whinny. "If I wished her dead, I would have done it myself," she hissed to the stunned thestrals. "Take her for medical attention. Leave him." Nightmare flapped her wings and flew skyward, higher and higher until she looked down over the skyscrapers of Manehattan.\n\nThe city grew dark, power cut to strategic locations as chaos engulfed the streets. Rumors spread in shadows and knives flashed in alleys. The city was hers, though it did not know it yet. Nightmare Moon had not lied to her lesser half. It was too late. And for a brief moment, perhaps she did wish that there was another way.\n\n"There is no going back," she said quietly to herself with Canterlot on the horizon. There would be no more weakness. She had a war to win and dove back to the ground."

equestria_civwar.1.t:0 "Shattered Diamonds"
equestria_civwar.1.d1:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle's mind raced as she hurried into the makeshift war room in Canterlot. Everything had happened so fast. Luna's thestral integration campaign had seemed to be going so well... and then the Nightmare struck, half of Equestria went dark, and the first reports of violence began trickling in from the new frontlines. War had been unthinkable for centuries, and the mere thought of pony killing pony - Twilight didn't want to think about it.\n\nLooking around, she recognized quite a few ponies at the table. Prince Blueblood and Fancy Pants, both looking completely exhausted. Raven Inkwell, fiercely scribbling down notes on a sheet of paper as if it could be the difference between life and death. And all of her friends, all her fellow Element Bearers... except one. "Where's Rarity?" Twilight asked. "She's coming, right?"\n\n"I was just getting to that, Princess Twilight," Blueblood said, his voice as ragged as his appearance. "The Nightmare has caught us at a severe disadvantage, as it is clear they have been preparing for this. It will take time to get Equestria in a state where we can push back, time we do not have. And as for the Element of Generosity, Miss Rarity..." the Prince trailed off for a moment. "She has been captured by the Nightmare in Manehattan."\n\nTwilight and her friends all gasped in shock and horror, but Blueblood lifted a hoof to quiet them. "Rarity is fine," he continued. "We know she is being safely held prisoner, and that does not seem like it will change soon. However, it does mean that you all will be unable to use your Elements of Harmony. The only way to end this war will be by force of arms, regrettable as it may be."\n\n"Wait, where's Princess Celestia?" Everypony looked towards Fluttershy, who seemed to sink a bit further into her chair. "Shouldn't she, um, be here to hear all this?"\n\nTwilight and Blueblood shared an uncomfortable glance. They both knew where she was; it was hard not to hear the broken sobs every time they walked past her chambers. But the door remained locked and the two guards never allowed entry, though neither would ever look Princess Twilight in the eyes. To do so would force everypony to face the truth, the reality of what the situation was.\n\nCelestia was gone, and nopony knew when she could come out again... or if she ever would."
equestria_civwar.1.d2:0 "My Empress, we have excellent news. Rarity, known to many as the Bearer of the Element of Generosity has been confirmed captured and is being held safely in Manehattan under tight supervision. As you have ordered she has not been harmed, and has been relatively compliant. More importantly, as I am sure you are aware, this means that the Solarists will no longer be able to strike you down with the Elements of Harmony this time. Now they will have to face us on the battlefield; something that we shall surely be victorious in. Let this be the first victory of many for the Night! Long live the Nightmare!"

equestria_civwar.2.d:0 "Following the outbreak of the Equestrian Civil War, the southeastern jungles were quickly seized by forces loyal to Nightmare Moon, centered around the thestral homeland of Ayacachtli. However, due to the difficult terrain and resources available, their control over the wider region was tenuous at best. This has finally boiled over, as harmonists loyal to Celestia have regrouped in Stableside under the leadership of Daring Do, the previously assumed fictional character of A.K. Yearling's books. Having seized the city and much of the surrounding area, they have declared their loyalty to the real Equestria against the Nightmareists."

equestria_civwar.3.d:0 "When the civil war began the mayor of Baltimare, Ash Moustache reportedly surrendered to the Lunarists arriving at the gates of the city, hoping to prevent further bloodshed. It seems that said hopes were in vain, however, as reports are coming out of a socialist uprising within the major Equestrian city and the surrounding land, driving out the Lunarist forces and proclaiming a communist republic in its place. Known as the Baltimare Republic and nominally led by the syndicalist Golden Delicious, they are no doubt a result of Stalliongrad's work in inciting revolution."

equestria_civwar.4.d:0 "Despite the southeastern jungles being the homeland of the thestrals, which have largely thrown in with Nightmare Moon, they are not the only ones who reside deep within the region. The Neighua, who have worshiped the sun and Celestia for over a millennium, quickly rose against the Lunar forces which would see them subjugated for freedom. What is surprising, however, is that they are being supported by a wide array of mercenaries, hired by none other than the formerly fictional character, Doctor Caballeron. Proclaiming himself to be the defender of the natives and fighting for their freedom, the newly-formed 'Aztlan Free State' has coalesced around Tenochtitlan to drive out all imperialists, whether they be Nightmarist or Equestrian."

equestria_civwar.5.d:0 "The Lunarists and thestrals of the southeast expected a loyal, subdued region ready to fight for the Nightmare against the forces of Celestia. They were sorely mistaken. Instead, Celestial loyalists have regrouped and taken the city of Stableside, communists have seized Baltimare and formed their own republic, and a mix of mercenaries and opposing natives have been able to take Tenochtitlan in the heart of the jungles. In response to this dire situation, the remnants of the local forces loyal to the Nightmare have reorganized under Commander Stars Whirl, who leads the Disciples of the Night in attempting to reclaim the region and subdue the rebellions. Whether they will be successful despite being pushed on the back hoof already remains to be seen."

equestria_civwar.6.d:0 "Southwestern Equestria has always been a place different from the rest of the nation. With an entrenched frontier spirit and a settler economy dominated by big agriculture and oil families, Canterlot had little reach within the Mild West. Now, with war spilling over and the buffalo once more becoming an issue, a local power player by the name of Rockfeller has threatened, bribed and paid his way to forming an independent state within the southwest, claiming to form a place free from the oppression of the alicorns in the north. While deeply unpopular, his army of mercenaries means he is unlikely to lose control anytime soon."

Unfortunately with such wealth flowing in such a small space comes with it the ones who rig the dice in their favor. Fearful of their assets being nationalized for the war effort and their less-than-honest schemes unraveling, the powers that be have forced the Mayor of Las Pegasus, Mayor Rokenhar, to declare an independent state free from the rule of Canterlot in spite of mass protests. The survival of the city does not seem likely in the circumstances it now finds itself in, but who knows what will truly happen next? After all, Las Pegasus is the city where anything is possible."

equestria_civwar.8.t:0 "The Rock Union"
equestria_civwar.8.d:0 "With the secession of both the Confederacy and Las Pegasus, the Rockville strip found itself stuck between two new semi-hostile statelets. Between a rock and a hard place, the region has finally declared its independence from Canterlot to respond to what it calls 'unwarranted aggression against hostile powers in the face of Celestia's inability to act'. Though they have not officially declared themselves officially totally separate from the homeland, it is clear that the authority of the Princess has finally completely slipped away, as local rock farmers operating under a socialist framework have taken the reins of governance from Rockville. Whether this has any connection to Stalliongrad and its work, only time will tell."

equestria_civwar.9.d:0 "Amethyst Star considered herself a fairly talented organizer. She had been the best in Ponyville until Princess Twilight arrived, after all, and had served as the leader of Ponyville's animal team for Winter Wrap for years. She had led the evacuation of Ponyville when the civil war began, ensuring friends and family made it to safety from the encroaching forces of Nightmare Moon. In Canterlot's perspective, she was the perfect fit to work as a factory organizer.\n\nShe absolutely hated it.\n\nThere were quotas to meet now, workers to keep track of, quality measures to be followed. A few months ago she had never even seen a rifle; now Amethyst was in charge of producing dozens. Out in the middle of western Equestria, working in a dreary factory with strangers she had never met before.\n\nThe door opened and Amethyst looked up as an exhausted mare stumbled in. Well, maybe not all strangers. "What's wrong, Roseluck? Lunch isn't for another half-hour."\n\n"I can't do this anymore." The unicorn frowned as Roseluck sat down opposite her and laid her head on the desk. "I'm a florist, not a factory worker. My cutie mark told me to sell flowers in Ponyville. I don't belong here."\n\n"None of us want to be here, Rose. But we all have to do our part to defend Equestria. I know you've already heard it a million times from the radio, but-"\n\n"-But it's true, I know," Roseluck finished. "That's not what I meant." The mare lifted her head and gestured at one of the charts on the wall. It was Amethyst's graph of factory productivity; the line was slowly drifting downwards towards the quota marker below it. "I drop springs, I put hammers in backwards. It feels like I slow everypony else down. I miss my garden, my friends, Ponyville. I miss how Equestria used to be."\n\nPausing for a moment, Amethyst Star slowly put a hoof on Roseluck's. "I've had seven ponies earlier this week come in and tell me the same thing," she gently whickered, causing the florist to look up in surprise. "We're all having trouble with this. I'm sure Lily and and Daisy are somewhere feeling the exact same way. But things can't go back to they were before, not yet. Ponyville, Equestria, it's all in danger, and we have to do this if we want to go home." The unicorn's horn glowed, and window blinds nearby raised themselves to reveal a bright morning outside. "Take the rest of the day off. Tend to your garden. Just... please come back tomorrow, okay? We all need you.""

equestria_civwar.10.t:0 "The Other Side"
equestria_civwar.10.d:0 "Princess Twilight Sparkle looked over the reports she had laid out on the desk before her, a look of heavy concern plastered on her muzzle. After Nightmare Moon plunged Equestria into a full civil war, Twilight had volunteered to take up much of the administrative duties in Celestia's absence. That included filing through all the reports the army was sending back to Canterlot, and more than a few of them painted a bleak picture.\n\nIt was a complete mess. Prince Blueblood was surprisingly performing much better at his role than Twilight has expected, but it was clear he couldn't lead and reform the entire Equestrian Army on his own. There just weren't enough capable officers to lead the ponies willing to fight, causing chaos throughout all levels of the military. Blueblood would never admit it, but he needed somepony that could take the strain off of him from the top. But who in Equestria was capable of doing that? Twilight couldn't do it herself; her knowledge of warfare was strictly academic, and the palace staff needed her elsewhere without Celestia...\n\nTwilight's head snapped up. There was somepony... or rather, somebody who might be able to help. It had been a long time since they had last seen each other, and Twilight had no idea what she was up to now. But it was the only pony Twilight could think of that might be able to handle what was needed.\n\n"Spike!" Twilight called out, waiting until her assistant hurried into the room. "Can you grab the journal? I have a letter to write.""
equestria_civwar.10.a:0 "It's time to call in an old friend."
equestria_civwar.11.t:0 "Across The Mirror"
equestria_civwar.11.d:0 "Twilight paced back and forth across the room, occasionally turning her head to look at the book on the table. This wasn't the room she was used to; the Princess had moved the mirror from her castle on the onset of the civil war far from the frontlines. It had been some trouble to keep the machinery installed on top of it intact, but she was fairly certain nothing had been damaged. What was more worrying was the lack of response from the journal. She was usually more punctual than this...\n\nThe surface of the mirror rippled, an amber unicorn on two legs wobbling out. "Twilight!" Sunset Shimmer said, flailing her forelegs before blinking and lowering herself to all fours. "Feels like it's been forever since the last time we've seen each other." She rushed forward and wrapped the alicorn in a crushing hug.\n\n"Well, the last time we saw each other you were leading an entire school's worth of ponies back through the portal," Twilight remarked. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything back at CHS-"\n\nSunset waved a hoof. "Nah, we're still on winter break. Sorry I'm late, we were taking a photo and Rarity was having us all dress up as- you know what, nevermind. So, what's the problem?"\n\n"Nightmare Moon has returned."\n\n"WHAT?!" Sunset whinnied. "L-Luna?! What happened?! Is Princess Celestia alright?"\n\nTwilight grimaced and looked away. "She's fine... kind of," she answered evasively. "I'm sure she'll want to see you again. Right now, we need your help stopping Nightmare Moon from taking over Equestria."\n\nSunset nodded. Twilight always wondered how she managed to absorb things so fast. It was a lot better than her own five minutes of worry when she had first heard the news. "Alright, what do you need me to do?"\n\n"Have you ever tried leading an army before?"\n\nSunset's horn sparked while her eyes turned cold."
equestria_civwar.11.a:0 "Let's hope she's a fast learner."
equestria_civwar.12.t:0 "Opening Doors"
equestria_civwar.12.d:0 "Dead silence.\n\nThis section of the castle had become used to silence. It had only ever had two residents and their personal guard, and again one of them was no more. There had been harsh, awful sobbing at first; neighs and gasps that made Celestia's door vibrate with sorrow. Now there was nothing but quiet, though the Night Guard whispered of choking and begging for her sister to come back in the late hours long past sundown. Still the door remained closed, locked to all except the bare minimum of palace staff who left her meals.\n\nSunset Shimmer's hooves shook as she stared at the door in front of her. Long ago, she had never hesitated to open it in search of answers to her many questions. Now, it felt like an insurmountable task to even touch the handle. "Maybe we should just go instead," she said quietly, all of her usual confidence gone. "Maybe she just needs a little more time."\n\n"Time is something we do not have, Miss Shimmer," Prince Blueblood reminded her. "We both have our duties to Equestria, and we cannot fulfill them under the circumstances. This is something we must do."\n\n"Easy for you to say, you're not the one asking her to open the door," Sunset grumbled back. Her hoof hesitated inches from the door, but she finally gave it two quiet knocks. "Princess Celestia? It's me, Sunset. Blueblood is here too, and... can we come in?"\n\nNo response. Between the solemn guards flanking the door and the silence, Sunset felt like a powerless filly again. Defeated, she turned to leave before the faint sound of a lock disengaging reached her ears. Blueblood raised his eyebrows and took the door handle in his magic, it giving way to silent entry.\n\n"Impressive. I can see why Princess Twilight chose you." The Prince trotted through the doorway, looking back at the unicorn. "Well?"\n\nSunset took a deep breath and followed, closing the door behind her."

equestria_civwar.13.d:0 "The room had barely changed in Sunset's absence from Equestria. There were some new books on the shelves, modern texts and novels for the new millennium's information and literature. Her desk had a few new ornaments on it, tokens and letters strewn across its surface. But the bed, the carpet, the walls were all identical to Sunset's memory.\n\nThe same could not be same for the Princess.\n\nShe was sitting with her back to them, looking out the window to the bright afternoon. Her ethereal mane was unkept, her usually pristine fur stained with tear marks. She was not wearing her golden shoes, peytral or tiara, and when she turned to look at Sunset and Blueblood her eyes were hollow. Broken. Tired.\n\n"It is good to see you again, Sunset," Celestia said, her voice absent any warmth or energy. "And you, nephew. I apologize for my absence."\n\n"Think nothing of it," Blueblood responded, waving a hoof. "You of all ponies have earned the right to mourn. However, I am afraid Miss Shimmer and I have come for more than just pleasantries."\n\nSunset nodded and stepped forward. "Celestia, Blueblood and I have been doing our best to manage Equestria but it's not enough. Ponies just aren't ready to fight Nightmare Moon, and we don't have the power to change that. We were hoping that you were ready to come back, but if you can't..."\n\n"...Miss Shimmer and I have agreed to form a military government, with your permission," the prince finished.\n\nPrincess Celestia gave a small, empty smile. "Of course you have my permission," she assented, failing to hide the painful look that had come from Sunset mentioning her sister. "I have faith in both of you to lead Equestria well with Princess Twilight. Should you need my aid in anything, I will do what I can."\n\n"I won't let you down, Celestia." Turning to leave with newfound determination on her muzzle, Sunset did not notice the Princess' wings sag to the floor. Blueblood did, pausing at the door.\n\n"Nephew?" Celestia turned back to her sun. "I... I am not ready to face Equestria yet. I cannot fight Luna again. If you need me I will be there, but..."\n\nBlueblood nodded. "Get some rest, Auntie.

"What are you doing here?"\n\nGiving a bright smile, Lyra Heartstrings sat down on the nearest chair in that strange way she always did, with her hind legs hanging off the front. "What, can't I come and visit a friend from Ponyville?" she responded, feigning hurt. "When I heard you were managing a factory here I knew I just had to say hello sometime. Bon Bon wanted to come, but she's very busy. Troops need candy to keep their energy up!" Lyra's eyes caught the productivity chart on the wall. The line was slowly evening out, probably too slowly for Canterlot. "Speaking of the factory, though, it's really nice. All your benches are very comfortable, and all the workers had nothing but nice things to say about you!"\n\nAmethyst paused. "You were asking them about me?"\n\n"Well, yeah," Lyra shrugged. "I didn't want to come visit if you were acting all moody or something. Between you and me, you used to get really bossy whenever you got angry. Did you hypnotize all these ponies, or did you just get really good at managing emotions?"\n\nAmethyst rolled her eyes. "Well, for the first few weeks I was too tired to get angry at anypony," she admitted as Lyra listened carefully. "But everypony here was having a hard time adjusting to this. What they needed was time and somepony to talk to, not an organizer yelling at them to go faster. Nopony wants to be here, but if we're all friends everything is a lot easier."\n\n"Sounds like something Princess Twilight would say," Lyra remarked as she smiled. "Well, it looks like you're doing a really good job here! I'm really proud of you, Amethyst." She idly checked her watch as it beeped, which made Amethyst blink with surprise - since when did Lyra have a watch? "Oops, if I stay any longer Bon Bon's going to get really mad at me. Nice seeing you again!"\n\n"You too, Lyra." As the mint unicorn got up, Amethyst's eyes narrowed. "Wait, how did you know I worked here in the first place?"\n\nLyra paused at the door, giving a strange smile back. "A friend told me!" she said brightly. "Good luck, Amethyst!"\n\nThe door closed, leaving Amethyst Star with countless unanswered questions."

When Canterlot had come to him of all ponies to write up an economic plan, it only seemed natural that they turn to such talent even if it was somewhat outside of Filthy's area of experience. Still, as he put the finishing touches on his proposal, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at the efficiency that would come from his ideas...\n\n"Dad? What have you been doing in here all day?" Filthy looked up from his desk as Diamond Tiara trotted into the room. Already nearing adulthood, she was almost as tall as himself. "Is this about mom's spending habits again?"\n\n"See for yourself," he answered as he hoofed over his outline. Diamond sat and quickly scanned over the pages with trained eyes, scowling in confusion. "Now, you might not understand everything in there, but the basics of it is-"\n\n"This is horrible." Diamond shoved the papers back into his muzzle. "Extreme rationing? Fourteen hour workdays? Stripping labor laws? Nopony in their right mind would agree to any of this."\n\n"Celestia could convince ponies..." Any confidence the stallion built up from indignation shattered from Diamond's glare; one of the few things she had inherited from her mother. "Canterlot told me to plan anything necessary to win the war," he tried weakly, eliciting only an eye roll and a sigh in response.\n\n"All this is going to do is make ponies angry, and not at Nightmare Moon. We can put up with a lot doing things together as friends, but stuff like this makes them hate you instead." The mare grimaced. "I would know."\n\n"Well, I can't send nothing back! This is my chance to prove myself to Canterlot and go beyond just Ponyville! It's for Celestia!"\n\n"Makes her look like the Nightmare," Diamond Tiara countered, extending a hoof to take the file back. "Let me write it. If they're lighter on ponies, it'll go over better.

equestria_civwar.16.d:0 ""Good work, lieutenant. You're dismissed." The guard saluted and promptly left the room, leaving behind the latest combat reports on the desk. Captain Flash Magnus hadn't been satisfied with anything involving the Royal Guard for a long while after the war began, even given his planned reforms being cut extremely short. Casualities were unacceptably high, and to compare their discipline to the old Cloudsdale Legion would have been an insult to his old legionnaires. But with hard won experience they were slowly shaping up, and perhaps they would soon meet the expectations of their forebears.\n\n"Captain Magnus?" A guardsmare walked in, saluting as she entered. "Marshal Clear Skies reporting in. There's been an issue with the guard posting in the west."\n\nFlash frowned. The west was mostly slim garrisons of the guard, mainly for the protection of communities from monster attacks. "Anything serious?" he asked. "Our resources are stretched thin as it is."\n\n"I understand, sir. There's been sporadic cases of public disorder in the rural west. Some of it is believed to be incited by enemy infiltration, taking advantage of local fear and doubt in the absence of Princess Celestia. The unrest is making it difficult to enforce the peace on a wider scale."\n\n"Isn't that S.M.I.L.E.'s job?"\n\nThe mare nodded, placing a report with the agency's seal on it on Flash's desk. "They're working on apprehending the lunarists inciting it, but those spooks don't work publicly. We're the ones who have to contain any resulting protests or panic from it. S.M.I.L.E. suggested we divert more of our new conscripts to enforce order in the affected areas."\n\n"The Guard has its duties on the frontline as well," the former legionnaire argued. "And I don't recall requesting S.M.I.L.E.'s input."\n\n"You may not like it, sir, but they have a point while things are relatively minor now they could drastically escalate if ponies feel provoked. Sending the guard in now can keep things orderly."\n\n"You mean like Severyana?" Magnus asked. "Read about that. I wonder if the old Captain of the Guard felt the same."\n\nClear Skies grimaced. "The decision is of course still in your hooves, Captain.""

"All these refugees across Equestria have been so despondent from losing their homes. The least I thought we could do is brighten their day a little."\n\n"Think nothing of it," Octavia replied as she finished tuning her strings. "Truth be told, we have not found many opportunities to play since this dreadful war began. We are more than happy to raise a few spirits with music."\n\nVinyl nodded in between adjusting the knobs and dials on a speaker set. "Well, we all certainly still appreciate it," Mayor Mare said. "Some of these ponies told me that they fled from as far as Albion and Prance to escape Nightmare Moon! I can't imagine the kind of emotions they're feeling, especially those who left their families behind..."\n\n"Yes, and speaking of emotions. Do you have any preference on what sort of style Vinyl and I should play in?"\n\n"I beg your pardon?"\n\n"Music is filled with emotions, mayor," Octavia patiently explained. "It is not just pleasant to listen to, it also makes ponies feel what the musician is feeling. A slow piece can calm." She demonstrated by playing a long, smooth note which made Mayor Mare instinctively relax. "Meanwhile, a fast and sharp piece..." Octavia followed up with a series of short intense notes, the mayor instantly more alert. "Do you understand?"\n\n"I suppose... but what do you think is best?"\n\nOctavia shrugged, putting her cello aside. "As you said, these ponies are anxious and despondent. Something soft and soothing could ease their fears and sorrows, bring hope for a brighter future." Vinyl waved a hoof, and the cellist sighed. "Or yes, we could do something fast and daring. Get them inspired and angry, ready to fight back against the Nightmare. Vinyl prefers that sort of thing. But we can't do both." She pointed her bow at Mayor Mare.

They had very different expectations with much less knowledge of bureaucracy and paperwork. Blueblood was at least familiar with the old system, but Shimmer was far too impatient for Raven's liking. Equestria had been unbearably slow in reforming itself, yes, but it was methodical, careful, precise. She demanded immediate responses to problems that were simply impossible to solve in a day. Sunset was a military commander first, and a political leader somewhere around fifteenth.\n\nUnfortunately, those two things were slowly becoming one and the same.\n\n"Miss Inkwell?" Raven looked up to see Prince Blueblood walk in, sitting down across from her. "I understand Miss Shimmer has requested a tighter military integration into the administration. May I assume you have already received it?"\n\n"I have," the mare confirmed. "Military commanders at almost every level of governance, working alongside civil administrators to coordinate wartime efforts. It was quite... extensive, if nothing else."\n\n"Yes, Shimmer is nothing if not extensive when it comes to matters like this. May I ask your thoughts on it?"\n\nFiling away another folder, Raven put down her quill and thought for a moment. "There is certainly room for military advice and practicality," she admitted as Blueblood listened. "Ponies like Fizzlepop Berrytwist and Maudileena Pie are proving themselves well. However, I have worries on what may result on lower levels of administration, especially with ponies who may have been radicalized. And all that aside, a reform of this scale would certainly require Princess Celestia's involvement to be successful."\n\n"I do not believe it wise to involve the Princess." Blueblood gauged the secretary carefully. "She is not well. The military government is meant to be a stopgap, not a method to force her into approving our decisions."\n\nRaven eyed her stack of paperwork. "Shimmer has a point."\n\nBlueblood stood up to leave. "I will leave this decision in your capable hooves, Miss Inkwell. Should you deem it necessary, I will work to implement this new administration with the utmost haste.

The Lunarists loved night raids, whinnying their keening war cry from the forests to spook the newer soldiers. For the earth pony, however, the sound just reminded him of the roar from the Whinnyapolis crowd. He skidded to a perfect stop beside a machine gun along the forward line. Like the past two times, he was ahead of the herd. Fast slung down the boxes and turned tail.\n\n"My loader’s down!" The gunner was also an earth pony, and something in his voice sounded familiar. Fast pivoted back to the gun and rammed the empty belt aside. He tried to ignore the body crumpled a few hooves away. The gunner nodded purple eyes framed by greasepaint and a heavy helmet. "Thanks, Fast. Get down."\n\nFast Ball ducked, ears pinning at the burst of gunfire ripping from the barrel. He blinked upwards at the strangely familiar pony. In his mind, suddenly the muzzle flashes were camera bulbs and the uniform was a lighter green jersey. "Short Stop!?"\n\nRiverpool’s best buckball kicker glanced down at his Whinnyapolis rival. "Different helmet, huh?" Short laid off the trigger to let the gun cool. The other machine guns opened up into the forest from the other pits. "Only recognized your hustle. How’s the rest of the team?"\n\nFast helped swivel the tripod into a new position along the sandbags. "I... don’t know. Around. They split us up." Another war cry echoed and he tried to laugh. "Why? You want a rematch? We’re out of season."\n\n"Ref was distracted," Short snorted, using the same excuse he claimed during the game. He still smiled as a bullet ripped through a nearby sandbag. "You’re on. I’ll scrounge the Riverpool Warriors up if we survive tonight." He reared back onto the gun.\n\n"When we survive tonight," Fast smirked, "Whinnyapolis’ll thrash your tails again.""

The design bureau and air force can accept whoever they want, but the Wonderbolts have a reputation for a reason."\n\nSoarin passed a file onto Spitfire's desk, the royal seal on its cover. "It's about the thestrals. Marshal Shimmer wants us to form a special group of them to work night operations, integrate them with our frontline divisions. Wants us to run a campaign encouraging them to apply."\n\nThe Wonderbolt Captain shrugged, opening the folder and giving it a cursory glance. "Sounds fine to me," she responded, tossing it back to Soarin. "What's the problem?"\n\n"The cadets. Most joined at the war's start. They want nothing to do with thestrals. And you know how trying to force team coordination goes...."\n\n"...It doesn't." she finished. "Can't the army just take them? I'm sure they could use the ponypower."\n\n"Like you said, we have a reputation for a reason. If we integrate them, the army will follow.

Zebrica was not Equestria, but the core idea remained the same. You were either broken by war or tempered by it, finding the strength and determination to fight back when confronted with reality. War weeded out the weak-willed creatures that Tempest once believed filled Equestria before Twilight brought her home.\n\nHowever, war also easily brought out the worst in those lacking discipline and self-control. And as Fizzlepop Berrytwist watched the newest group of recruits for the Equestrian army, a horrifying sense of familiarity began to seep in.\n\n"I checked their reports," Grubber said as he waddled over, files in claw. "These ponies have super high marks. Like I'm talking top of the mountain high, definitely not just normal Equestrians. They'd probably be super effective."\n\n"Did you watch them during training as well?"\n\nThe hedgehog nodded. "They really hate those bats. Like, I was listening in on a talk they were having and all I heard was stuff like 'I can't wait to finally kill some traitors' and 'they'll all pay for betraying Celestia' and that kind of thing."\n\nFizzlepop frowned. Her task was to win the war, given by Sunset herself. Equestria needed more ponypower, more soldiers, and these were badly needed recruits. But this, this was the first time she didn't want to send a group off to the front.\n\n"Uh, Fizzlepop? Can I say something else?" The unicorn raised an eyebrow but motioned for Grubber to continue. "This isn't a good idea. I know how much you hate talking about when you were Commander Tempest, but you gotta admit we were really good at trying to follow your orders. These guys, they don't seem like that. They're gonna do what they want no matter what you say, and something tells me other ponies aren't gonna like what they do."\n\nGrubber could be very observant, when he wanted to be.

And yet the Nightmare remained, personally leading a last strike upon the capital with her fanatics in a desperate bid to take the throne.\n\nShe was the only survivor. Nightmare Moon's armor was shattered, her blood stained the carpet beneath her hooves, and yet the dead royal guards surrounding her remained a testament to her power and fury.

She limped forward despite her injuries, and gave a broken laugh at Twilight's step backwards. "You lack conviction, sister. You always have."\n\nCelestia took a deep breath. "I will do what I must."\n\nThe Nightmare laughed again at the parody of determination before her. "Spare me your acting," she said, continuing to advance upon teacher and student.

A heavy burden, one with hardship and struggle that many ponies couldn't understand. To smile, wave and lead, to build Equestria anew waiting for a sister forgotten, the mistakes of the past eternally weighing heavy with every choice she made. How had things gone so wrong again? How did she lose Luna so soon?\n\nThe blame was hers. She had grown too complacent, too trusting, too lax. Memories rushed through Celestia's mind. Watching Sunset Shimmer leave, unable to save her from her own ambition. The Severyanian ponies, forced to rebel after years of oppression. Laying powerless at the hooves of Chrysalis as Canterlot fell. And finally Luna, looking at her with hope and determination as she spoke of the thestrals, falling victim to a failing Celestia had never fixed. How could she have been so blind?\n\nCelestia had always believed there was time. She was immortal, after all. She could wait for change, for heroes to rise, for ponies to become better and see the error of their own ways. But how many suffered while she waited? How many ponies had died in a war of her own making? No longer. No more.\n\nSo much still needed to be done. Nightmare Moon had broken Equestria in far more than two, and shadows circled the pieces.

"Come on, we gotta regroup!"\n\nThe light grey mare nodded before her eyes widened. "Dash, behind-"\n\nTwisting to the side, Rainbow barely managed to avoid a lethal blow as the unicorn's sword cleaved downwards. Instead her left wing got caught, sliced clean through right at the humerus. She fell to the side, vision darkening as the unicorn snarled above her through a shattered muzzle. Vapor Trail raised her rifle and killed him; the body fell atop blue feathers. Rainbow barely registered the mare rushing to her side, screaming "MEDIC!"\n\nThe last thing she remembered was staring at the starry sky above her."

Canterlot had a special place in her heart of course, but the Big Apple had its own unique flair as well, a city of creativity and innovation that often made the fashionista feel right at home. She could spend hours watching the bustle of the city from above.\n\nGiven that she had been under house arrest for months, however, her patience had started wearing thin.\n\n"Miss Rarity?" Two guards entered the room, a thestral and a pegasus both in dark purple uniforms. "I'm sorry we're late, there's a new garrison commander who didn't want to give us your rations for the day. Swift Mane had to threaten them a bit to hoof it over."\n\n"Oh please," she replied to the thestral, "Celestia knows I miss your company more than anything else. And thank you for going to such efforts, Swift."\n\nThe pegasus scowled. "It is not my or Moonlight Bolt's job to entertain you," he responded gruffly. "I do as the Nightmare commands, nothing more." The stallion moved to guard the door with rifle at the ready; Rarity supposed it was Chiropterran discipline at work.\n\n"I brought you something else, Miss Rarity." Rummaging through his saddlebag, Moonlight pulled out a heavy journal with Twilight Sparkle's cutie mark on its cover. "It was hard to get a copy, but I found one in a bookstore while on patrol. Swift practically tore it apart before letting me bring it here."\n\n"It's filled with nothing but vile Solarist propaganda about harmony, written by agents of the Sun Tyrant."\n\nRarity gave the pegasus a look. "Those 'agents of the Sun Tyrant' are my friends, you know," she sternly reminded him. "But yes, I do remember helping write this back in Ponyville. All those adventures still feel like they were only yesterday..."\n\n"Is it true that you fought a bugbear in Ponyville?" Moonlight rapidly flipped through the pages before stopping and pointing at a picture. "I've only heard about them in legends!"\n\nRarity noticed Swift Mane's ears twitch at attention, and the faint hint of a smile pulled at her muzzle.

That at least meant that Fluttershy was starting with something to work with when she volunteered to lead it. Still, much like everything else it was underequipped and understaffed to deal with the constant flow of wounded from the frontline, both friendly and enemy.\n\nIt was the latter of the two that was causing her the most headaches with the staff.\n\n"Fluttershy, what are you doing?"\n\nThe pegasus did not look back at Doctor Fauna as she continued to assign triage tags to the wounded, her hooves slick with blood. "A lot of these ponies are suffering from heavy bleeding," she replied, moving from patient to patient. "If we don't treat them immediately we'll lose them."\n\n"Yes, but..." Fauna gestured to the tattered remains of the uniforms, dark purple and still retaining the insignia of the Nightmare. "They're lunarists! The enemy! We're having enough trouble keeping up with all our own wounded as it is!"\n\nFluttershy turned to face the veterinarian, wings flaring up with anger. "So we have to kill them because our soldiers weren't able to?" she fired back. "These ponies were our friends once, Doctor Fauna. If we can't save everypony, I am not going to pick and choose. We have to be better than that."\n\nStunned, Fauna watched as Fluttershy returned to the unresponsive ponies in medical beds, her mind still processing what had just happened. For a few moments the only sounds were gauze rolls being unwrapped and the moans of the dying. Wordlessly, the earth pony trotted over to stand by the pegasus, taking a scalpel from the nearby surgical tray.\n\n"Hold his wing up.

The doctors had told her it would take time for her body to adjust to using the prosthetic. The enchanted steel and magical connection to her innate pegasus magic made it as close to real flesh and bone as possible, but Torque Wrench's designs had never been intended for combat purposes. She needed to be patient and careful with its razor sharp feathers.\n\nAll stupid advice. Rainbow wasn't a Wonderbolt by being slow or cautious. She did everything her way, and the many self-inflicted scars all over her proved that. Through trial and tribulation she had gotten her control of the metal down to such precision that it almost felt like her original wing.\n\nIt was that 'almost' that she hated. Nevermind the constant oiling that it needed, the itch drove her insane. It was always there, reminding her of what she lost. "You okay, Crash?" Fleetfoot asked. "You know we're all here for you, right?"\n\n"I'm fine."\n\n"You're not," the Wonderbolt disagreed. "We've all noticed, Crash. None of us are happy, and I swear I saw Spitfire throw a chair after ordering a new memorial for the Academy. But you can't let it get to you like this. So what if you can't do a sonic rainboom - you're still the fastest 'bolt in-"\n\nRainbow slashed through the last mango so hard the fruit exploded. "You don't get it!" she finally shouted, waving her metal wing around. "You weren't there! I still have nightmares about waking up in that medical tent and seeing what was left of my wing before the docs put me under again, and I don't even know if Nightmare Moon is doing that or not! Do you know how hard it is having to listen to ponies say 'oh, they're Equestrians too'?"\n\nFleetfoot flinched as Rainbow fixed her with a baleful glare. "They aren't." After a few seconds, the prismatic pegasus huffed. "I'm heading back to HQ," she said as she readied herself into flight position. "If you want to help, win this stupid war.

Apples were fed into industrial vats that spit out something resembling apple sauce into metal cans, which were quickly packaged in wooden crates. Countless unfamiliar ponies trotted about in uniform, working to make up for the loss of one particular pony.\n\n"Ain't right, Applejack," Granny Smith complained as she looked out the window.

Applejack needs to check the lines."\n\nAs her family slowly trotted away, the last farmpony tilted her hat downwards. She had seen the reports, read the orders. Applejack was no student in fancy mathematics, but she still understood that there was no choice. Ponies on the front needed these rations, and everypony else needed to sacrifice what was necessary.

They were already hard at work in the palace when the clocks rung seven. Fancy still preferred his morning tea, while Raven had switched to double-shot coffee a long time ago. Both of them had large stacks of papers piled on their desks, reports and applications and every kind of paperwork imaginable.\n\n"I say, your work didn't seem quite as difficult as it actually is," Fancy commented as he signed another page with a quill and put it aside. "Has it always been this tedious?"\n\nRaven stamped another file with the royal seal. "Yes, but there was never this much to deal with," she replied. "Cities used to run themselves. Now that the Princess wants regular reports from all across Equestria sent to Canterlot for review, I have to deal with those while reviewing all the new candidates for the bureaucracy."\n\n"So she gave you that task as well. I am very busy looking at which of my peers may still be of use to the Princess. Unfortunately many only desired the status and social events of Canterlot, making them rather... uncooperative."\n\n"I didn't know they ever weren't."

If you know some ponies good at management or organizing, I can make sure they still have a place in Canterlot."\n\nIt took a moment for the socialite to put down his quill and take off his monocle. His eyes were just as weary as Raven's. "I suppose there are a few I know who could be of use to you," he admitted. "Perhaps it is time to put the past behind us.

He left just as quietly as he entered. Rainbow found his file after a moment of silence. They had served on opposite sides in the same sectors, so he probably wasn't lying. Skill wise, he was decent. But she held his file above the wastebin. It hovered there in her remaining wing before she tossed it back onto her desk."

equestria_celestia.8.d:0 "The city of Fillydelphia had suffered much during the civil war. One of the two primary lunarist strongholds, it had been defended to the death by countless ponies. Rebuilding had already cleared away much of the rubble, but there were still many scars left as reminders of what battles had been fought. Some were unsure if they would ever fade.\n\nBut Princess Celestia was not here to survey damages. The City of Sisterly Love had commissioned a great war memorial for the fallen, both lunarist and loyalist alike. Celestia had personally approved funding for it, with a minor alteration. A giant statue of her sister in the center, in full ceremonial armor looking defiantly towards the Celestial Sea. That statue was behind her now as she stepped forward onto the podium, looking out over the countless ponies of all four tribes who had come to listen to the unveiling. Celestia needed no amplifier; the Royal Canterlot Voice would suffice.\n\n"Ponies. We are here today not to celebrate a victory, but to give respects to the fallen. In this city and all across Equestria, brave soldiers gave their lives defending what they believed in. Many died defending Harmony from darkness. Others died believing what they were fighting for was right, misled by the forces of evil. No matter the side they chose, they deserve to be remembered as heroes."\n\nThe Princess allowed a few moments of silence, looking skyward to the image of her sister standing above her. "Princess Luna was one of those heroes," she continued as she turned her attention back to the crowd. "She was my equal in every way, who struggled against a darkness we were all blind to. She fought the Nightmare and the monsters who desired her return at every step, no matter the cost to herself. It was betrayal by the true enemies of harmony that brought her fall, something that nopony could stand against."\n\nThe ponies began to mutter amongst themselves. There was anger, a desire for retribution building. Celestia continued on, her voice growing fiery. "She is gone now, but her memory lives on in every pony of Equestria. My sister would harbor no regrets about what needed to be done, and neither must we. We must uphold her legacy by continuing her fight against the darkness wherever it may spread! We must slay the monsters for all the ponies we have lost! For Princess Luna!"\n\n"FOR PRINCESS LUNA!" the crowd roared back. With a quick spell from Celestia's horn the braziers scattered around the statue of Luna ignited, burning a deep ethereal blue. Ponies continued to chant her name as Celestia turned to walk away, stopping at the base of the gigantic stone hooves.\n\n"Never again," she said quietly. "They will remember you this time, sister. I promise you that.""

equestria_celestia.9.d:0 ""Your move, Auntie." Celestia's rook moved four spaces towards Blueblood as the two ponies intently studied the chessboard before them. The Princess played white and her nephew played black, as the two always had. What had once been a simple game to pass the time had turned into an endless war between them, one of ever-evolving strategies and countermoves. Still, it always ended one way; Blueblood had been forced on the defensive, approaching checkmate. "I am sure you remember the story of Leoneighdas, yes?" he asked.\n\n"Three hundred pegasi held back a griffon army for three days using a mountain pass," Celestia recited. "It was a demonstration of using terrain to one's advantage."\n\n"And the source of the 'hammer and anvil' tactic?" Blueblood's pawn moved forward.\n\n"King Arantigos. His victories came from regularly encircling enemy armies from both sides during battles."\n\n"Very good." Celestia's knight took a bishop. "These lessons are all important to take to heart. However, they are ultimately useless if they are applied too rigidly. And on that note..." Blueblood slid his rook across the board. "Check."\n\nCelestia started. That wasn't supposed to happen. Looking at the board again, she saw that Blueblood's pieces were slightly off from where she remembered. And as she looked at her own situation, the only option left was sacrificing her queen. She hadn't lost her queen since the game was called shatranj, and her sister had said 'shah mat'.\n\n"Never be predictable," Blueblood stated at he took her queen. "And never assume the enemy is predictable. Grover the First defeated the griffons of Evi by crossing the Creeper Mountains, which none of them expected. A commander may do something stupid by every piece of conventional wisdom, and you must not let that stupidity get the best of you."\n\nThe Princess nodded. No more assumptions. She considered her remaining pieces warily. "This won't happen again," Celestia warned.\n\n"I would be disappointed if it did. Now, for today I have brought some field reports from General Pinkamena Pie's battles...""

equestria_celestia.10.d:0 ""You don't have to hold back."\n\nSunset frowned, reforming her fractured shield as Princess Celestia stalked around her. The entire duel had been nothing but a game of cat and mouse, with Sunset blocking or evading everything the alicorn could throw at her. Celestia fired another beam of golden magic at Sunset, the unicorn's magical shield cracking but not breaking.\n\nAlready feeling the effects of magical exhaustion, Celestia poured more power into another magic blast, one which finally managed to shatter her former student's shield. "I'm not," she snorted, unleashing a wild fireball which Sunset quickly teleported away from. Any momentary satisfaction at that, however, was quickly cut short when Sunset reappeared at her forelegs with a blazing horn. Celestia's vision filled with sunspots and she stumbled backwards, swinging a wing to bat away the smaller unicorn. By the time she reoriented herself vines had already sprouted from the ground below her and bound her legs together. A final concussive blast struck her side and toppled her; Celestia looked up to see Sunset standing over her with horn blazing a brilliant red.\n\n"I yield," Celestia conceded.\n\nSunset blinked, her magic sizzling out as she stepped back with a look of shock on her muzzle. The vines receded, allowing Celestia to stand once more. "I..." she started, trying to process what had just happened. "Princess, you didn't need to-"\n\n"I was not holding back," Celestia answered firmly. "And it is clear you have learned much since we first parted ways."\n\n"War tends to do that," Sunset admitted, scratching the back of her neck with a hoof. "I train with the mage companies, and I've been meaning to practice my self-levitation with the Wonderbolts."\n\n"Are the mages as skilled as you?"\n\n"No, I still have to fight multiple at a time for it to be any challenge. But that's the goal. Equestria lost a lot of ponies over the war, and I don't want to let that happen again. Heroes have always been a part of Equestria's history, and we need them now more than ever." Sunset gave a hopeful glance at her former teacher. "Another round?"\n\nCelestia pressed a wing to her side and felt a growing bruise."

equestria_celestia.11.t:0 "From the Ashes"
equestria_celestia.11.d:0 "It was that time again.\n\nPhilomena was sick, a mere shadow of her former self. Her feathers had almost completely fallen off, signaling the end of the cycle. Such was the life of a phoenix; one that Philomena had lived for centuries at Celestia's side. The Princess still remembered that time shortly after Luna's banishment, when she had found a lone phoenix egg while returning from a visit to the dragons. With no parents or other phoenixes to be found Celestia had taken her back to Canterlot, and in turn Philomena became her sole companion over the thousand years she had ruled alone. In many ways they were almost one and the same.\n\nCanterlot had learned better than to mock or take advantage of the phoenix while she was frail and weak. Those who did always found themselves on the receiving end of a prank once Philomena had finished her cycle. Sometimes ponies would complain, particularly if the form of revenge was mean-spirited, but Celestia had never reprimanded her companion for her actions. After all Philomena knew the limits of what she could get away with, and it was often a good lesson to ponies on how not to take advantage of another creature just because they were vulnerable.\n\n...Equestria was ready. The scars of the war were fading, and the nation stood united behind their princess in the pursuit of vengeance. Now was time to look outward and retake what was lost. Stalliongrad, the changelings, the traitors in Zebrica, all would learn the price to pay. There was only one answer to provocation by provocation.\n\nThe bird in front of Celestia burst into flames, quickly becoming nothing more than a pile of ash. The Princess stood, watching as it trailed up into the air and coalesced into a tornado before a new phoenix burst out in a brilliant display of light. Celestia did not wince or look away; a foreleg extended outwards.\n\nPhilomena obeyed the silent command and perched upon her leg. The Equestrian Army was ready for its mission, the ponies ready for their Princess. Equestria had been reborn.\n\nIt was time to rule."

equestria_celestia.12.d:0 "To the loyalist government,\n\nEquestria and the Princess thanks you for your tireless devotion to Harmony and its principles in these difficult times. You have fought well, and your loyalty is to be commended. However, now is the time for Equestria to become whole once more, and we ask that you prove your loyalty to Equestria and Princess Celestia once more by willingly submitting back to the authority of Canterlot. Rest assured that your regional government will be allowed to remain autonomous for the near future, until a permanent solution is found and reintegration can be more thoroughly achieved.\n\nNote that refusal will be considered a sign of treason, and will be punished as such.\n\nBy the order of Princess Celestia, Monarch of Equestria."

equestria_celestia.13.d:0 ""President, it's for you."\n\nSugarquill's heart sank the moment she saw the royal seal on the letter. Canterlot had finally come knocking, and Las Pegasus was always going to be in the firing line no matter who was victorious in the north. Perhaps she had entertained some vague hope that the conflict would go on forever, or that the victor would inherit a nation too ravaged by war to pursue reunification. Now, the fate of everything the city had worked so hard to build rested on a single piece of paper that the president unfolded with her hooves.\n\n\nSugarquill,\n\nEquestria sends its regrets for the death of the late Mayor Rokenhar. Though he may have led the city astray, he served the nation well for many years and fought against the interests that demanded secession. However, that is not the reason this letter has arrived.\n\nYour refusal to reintegrate into Equestria constitutes treason. However, I am willing to show mercy and pardon for all involved in the creation of your state should you pledge loyalty to Canterlot immediately. All current staff will be able to continue working in the administration of Equestria, subject to new oversight. Refusal will result in reintegration by any means necessary.\n\nI am giving you one chance, Sugarquill. There will not be another.\n\n-Princess Celestia\n\n\nOne chance. Sugarquill put down the letter and pondered it for a moment. A full surrender to the Princess was out of the question; she would not let Rokenhar's dream die after everything they'd done. But perhaps if she bent the knee, asked for autonomy in return for loyalty, then the dream of a free Las Pegasus could live on. Of course she could always refuse, but that would certainly result in a catastrophic war with Equestria that may be impossible to win.\n\nEither way, she was out of time."

equestria_celestia.14.d:0 "Las Pegasus just couldn't resist rolling the dice, could they?\n\nThe notion that Las Pegasus believed they were in any position to negotiate was already a showcase of the arrogance that led them to secede in the first place. Their response to her letter was neither a surrender or a rejection; it was a counteroffer. Their loyalty in return for their autonomy. Sugarquill wanted to retain her own administration separate from Canterlot, and in return she promised the support of the city and its resources for Equestria. The self-styled president was bargaining with things that were expected of any Equestrian, but Princess Celestia's irritation was subdued by a more rational, calculating mind.\n\nEquestria could win any war between the two, that was for certain. But it would expend valuable resources, soldiers and equipment far better spent fighting Equestria's more pressing enemies. S.M.I.L.E.'s digging had proven that Sugarquill was a talented and able administrator, one who had built a flexible and loyal staff to run her state. She could be an asset as a figurehead, and Celestia certainly had ways to ensure her loyalty past her promises.\n\nBut the arrogance gave her pause. Compromise was what had caused evil to take root in the first place. Putting down Las Pegasus would send a clear message to all, and enable a total end to regionalism there. She had no need to entertain a mere mare who believed herself powerful enough to stand against a Princess.\n\nPeace? Or war? The choice was hers, as it always had been."

equestria_celestia.15.d:0 ""Tlatoani, it's for you."\n\nLight Narrative knew what had landed upon his desk long before opening the letter. He was mainly a figurehead, the public face to unite the thestral tribes of Tzinacatlia while the Moonspeaker Conclave passed their proposals. But this had brought that conclave to a deadlock with bitter infighting and countless arguments. Thus it fell to him to make the final decision that would decide Tzinacatlia's future.\n\n\nTlatoani Light Narrative,\n\nI understand that you and the moonspeakers have driven out the forces loyal to the Nightmare. That, along with your commitment to creating a state for all ponies has given you and the thestral tribes one opportunity for atone for your initial treason. Return to the fold and you will be allowed to remain as Tlatoani, and the moonspeakers' role as spiritual leaders will be respected. All matters of state however will now be managed by loyal Equestrians from Canterlot.\n\nShould you refuse, you will meet the same fate those loyal to the Nightmare have.\n\n-Princess Celestia\n\n\nNopony in the conclave liked the obvious demand for surrender. Too many thestrals had fought and died for Tzinacatlia, and now the Princess of the Sun was trying to tear it away again. But the more moderate among the moonspeakers were pragmatic enough to realize that a war with Equestria would be an uphill battle despite the defensive jungle terrain, and desired a more equal agreement with autonomy in exchange for surrender. The more hardline among them wanted nothing to do with Equestria, even if it clearly meant a brutal war. If they could bleed Equestria out, perhaps the Princess would be forced to see reason. Of course with the loss of Princess Luna, there was no telling what Equestria would do next no matter what Tzinacatlia offered.\n\nAfter a moment, Light Narrative drafted his opinion to the conclave."

The thestrals, the tribe who felt that they never had a home in Equestria had finally made their own. It was a new state, one that treated all natives there with respect. They had cast off their former loyalty to the Nightmare, governed with a fair hoof and maintained their traditional faith of the moon, one older than the arrival of the alicorns.\n\nAnd yet their state was built on treason. It only existed because the thestrals sided with the forces loyal to the Nightmare, and betrayed them in turn while they had been reveling in their victory over the southeast. Tzinacatlia was not built on friendship and harmony like Equestria had been, but rather through bloodshed and backstabbing. Even now they still harbored traitors under their policies of tolerance and unity among thestrals. Perhaps they did denounce Chiropterra and recognized the threats of Equestria were the threats of all ponykind, but could she really allow them to go unpunished?\n\nThey demanded autonomy for their state. That was all they wanted. Perhaps after a thousand years the thestrals did deserve a homeland, one that wasn't a den of evil like that of Zebrica. But their place was also here in Equestria.

Said they knew I wouldn't be able to do anything with it." Caballeron carefully opened it and began to read.\n\n\nCaballeron,\n\nBy fighting against the Celestial Resistance and refusing to swear loyalty to Equestria, you have proven yourself a traitor. However, your intention to create a state for the natives of the southeast through reconcilation as well as your efforts in destroying the remaining radicals within your state has been noticed. Therefore, I am offering you and your mercenaries one opportunity to rectify your failure and return to the fold. You will all be granted full pardons and forgiveness, and your reforms will remain intact albeit continued under Equestrian administration.\n\nShould you refuse, your 'federation' will be treated as the warlord state it is. I trust you understand the consequences.\n\n-Princess Celestia\n\n\n"She's asking for our surrender, isn't she?" Jungle Trek asked. Caballeron put the letter down and nodded. "Well, what are you going to do?"\n\nThe doctor tapped a hoof on his desk for a few moments. "We are not giving up Aztlan," he stated. "But she is not giving us a choice. Perhaps, if we offer her our loyalty, she may let us keep our federation alive here. Otherwise, there will be war."\n\nJungle Trek shrugged. "Sounds like a losing battle. We've all heard the legends of their military talent in the north. But we've faced bad odds before and pulled through. No matter what you choose we'll be fighting for Aztlan until the end, Doctor."\n\nA rare statement from a mercenary.

The stallion shook with poorly-disguised fear as he stood before the Princess, her guard and Rainbow Dash, who had taken an interest in the fate of the formerly-fictional villain's state.\n\n"The Federation of Aztlan is willing to surrender, Princess Celestia," the blue earth pony said, "as long as you allow it to remain as an autonomous region of Equestria. Doctor Caballeron wishes to remain as governor to ensure the continued peace and prosperity of the southeast."\n\n"Of course he does," Rainbow shot back. "So he can make more money off of it, like he always does. Princess, you can't trust anything him or his cronies say."\n\n"The Doctor takes his agreements very seriously," the mercenary argued. "It is how we made peace with the natives. Princess, Aztlan understands the necessity of a unified Equestria. It is why we offer our support."\n\n"You offer something I should have by right."

"It is our home now, and we are willing to die for it. But Aztlan offers its loyalty to you, Princess Celestia, if you let us keep it."\n\nThe prismatic pegasus did not move, instead looking up to the Princess.

It referred to Princess Mi Amore Cadenza by her full title, opened with the acknowledgement that the loss of economic aid had no doubt crippled the Crystal Empire's ability to respond to the situation in Equestria, and offered pardons for any Lunarist remnants that had crossed the border fearing reprisal. It ended by promising a resumption of the traditional relationship between the Empire and Equestria, with a gentle reminder that Princess Amore and her heirs owed their titles to the Princess of the Sun. The royal family had no reason to distrust its sincerity. Except it had not been written by Celestia.  "Raven," Shining Armor said, lowering the letter. "Nothing from Twilight. She might be too busy."\n\nCadance continued to pace, absently thinking of the food shortages, power failures, and the fluctuating Crystal Heart below.

"So I write back to Raven?" Spike asked, tapping a quill in his palm. "Celestia had to send it to me. I know that Luna... and, well..." He looked to the balcony. Another crowd had gathered around his statue as guards gave out wartime rations to the last refugees. They were almost entirely Thestrals.\n\n"I'm sure some of them are spies," Shining followed the look. "Some are deserters. Some are desperate. And we don't have enough ponies to cover it. Sombra was enough. This isn't a debate. We need help."\n\n"Of course," Cadance agreed, ceasing to pace. "But I'm not sure how to ask or what to say. Not through paper. I need you to write it, Shining. You know Raven better. The Crystal Empire formally returns to the fold. I will meet with Celestia myself."

When the Princess had called, she returned home.\n\n"It's good to see you again, Celestia," Cadance began as the two walked down one of the hallways of Canterlot. "Having to rule the Crystal Empire has been a lot of work for me and Shiny, especially after we had to take charge of industrialization and education.

Aunt Twilight had tried saying things too, but just ended up crying too much and had to be pulled away by her friends.

equestria_celestia.23.d:0 ""...So please, ponies of Equestria and Severyana alike. I know what it's like to want change. To see something unfair and base your view of the world on how to fix it. But communism isn't the way to do that. Their dreams of a better world aren't real. So please, ask yourself if what you're hearing from Stalliongrad is a lie. Equestria didn't want this war, and I'm sure you didn't either."\n\nPutting down the recorder, Starlight Glimmer sighed and gave an exasperated look at Director Sweetie Drops sitting across from her. "Was that good enough for you?"\n\n"Yes," the earth pony replied plainly. "Now just repeat it in Severyanian and that'll be it."\n\nStarlight rolled her eyes. The two had been at it for what must have been hours; she could only guess given that there was no way of telling time in this empty room. "You know, I don't really appreciate being pulled in here to read off a script. Or being used for propaganda in a war."\n\n"And I don't appreciate having to keep tabs on you all the time," the Director fired back. "Running a cult, trying to destroy the fabric of reality with time travel, ponynapping and mind controlling Equestria's heroes. If it was up to me, we would have thrown you in Tartarus years ago."\n\n"How..." Starlight swallowed. "How do you know all that?"\n\n"S.M.I.L.E. knows everything. We'd be a poor intelligence agency if we didn't." Sweetie Drops' watch beeped once, causing her to frown in annoyance. "Now are you done wasting my time?"\n\n"Fine."

Her friends had been a massive help in getting things ready, at least after she had convinced them that Stalliongrad was no longer the place of friendship they thought it was. Double Diamond, Party Favor, and Night Glider had all proven themselves some of the best friends she could ask for. Even now they were spreading the word so that tomorrow's revolt would go as planned.\n\nBut it wasn't just them. The only reason any of this was possible was the S.M.I.L.E. pin she kept hidden away in a secret drawer. She had joined shortly after Starlight had run off and the Soviet had formally reannexed the town, sending reports by dragonfire whenever she caught wind of anything important. The reports back soon became shipments of 'famine relief', brought by a certain apple farmer who had quickly become the love of her life...\n\nThe door opened. Sugar Belle looked up and blinked in surprise. "Big Mac?"\n\n"Eeyup.

Through thick and thin they had fought together, often against overwhelming odds. Now they stood side by side in one of the less-ruined parts of Princessyn, having just helped teams coordinate with the rebuilding efforts.

Countless holes in the concrete roof and walls let streams of sunlight into the room, and rubble still littered the floor. The throne had been shattered and its pieces brought back to Canterlot for study into their antimagical properties. But Twilight's mind was on none of those things. Her focus was solely on Princess Celestia, standing on the remains of the dais with a broken crown at her hooves. Three changeling queens stood in front of her below, with Thorax off to one side.\n\n"The war is over," Celestia said, her eyes watching the three changelings as if daring them to make a move. "Chrysalis has fled like the coward she was. All of her loyalists are dead. The only reason you three are not is because you saw wisdom in surrender. But I have no doubts that if given the chance, you would have gladly followed in her hoofsteps."\n\nNone of the queens argued. "That is why I shall not allow the chance for this to happen again," the alicorn continued. "Thorax will be made the new king of Vesalipolis. You three will be allowed to keep your traditional demesnes and your subordinate families. Lyctida will be given to the heir of the hive. The borderlands and Volistad will be under direct Equestrian administration indefinitely."\n\nThorax's eyes widened as she looked in horror at Twilight, who in turn was staring with a similar expression at Celestia. The hives were unified under Chrysalis, but they had done so decades ago. No changeling would want to go back to the era of strife between hives. But if Celestia even noticed Twilight's expression, she didn't show it. "This is the one chance at mercy I am granting you. There will not be another."\n\nThe queens shared a look at each other. Then slowly, one by one they knelt before the Princess of Equestria, their heads bowed low. Celestia flared her wings skyward before turning to look at Thorax. The drone took a step back in fear and shot one last pleading glance at Princess Twilight before joining the queens in supplication to the Sovereign of the Sun.\n\nTwilight quickly excused herself from the room."

equestria_celestia.29.d:0 "Director Sweetie Drops did not enjoy being in Vesalipolis. It wasn't the city itself or the hostile architecture or the cold climate. It was the inhabitants. With a race who could shapeshift into any creature, she could never shake the feeling of being watched. As a pony who prided herself on knowing and seeing everything, the less time she spent in this place the better.\n\nUnfortunately, she had a job to do. The Vesalipolis Office of Public Safety had tried vanishing with the wind upon the surrender of the Changeling Queendom. The key word was 'tried'. Some of their agents were executed immediately; others they were given a choice to die as 'loyalists', or use their unique skills in service of a new agency. Sweetie had placed only her most trusted ponies in charge of keeping their leashes, since skilled changelings would be needed to keep a better eye on things in these hives...\n\n"You've been busy, haven't you? I'm sure my brother wouldn't be happy."\n\nSweetie Drops's hoof instinctively moved towards her pistol as she turned to see a purple-eyed changeling drone standing behind her. "General Pharynx," Director Drops acknowledged as she let her hoof drop back to the floor. "You'll have to be more specific than that."\n\n"Don't play your pony games with me. I take being the Captain of the King's Guard seriously, and that means knowing everything you Equestrians are up to here. Did you think I wouldn't recognize all the new changelings showing up to 'help' my brother?"\n\nPharynx was smarter than most of the other changelings Thorax had at his side, Sweetie Drops had to admit. "So what if we are?" she replied levelly. "If 'King Thorax' has an issue with it, he can being it up with us."\n\nThe drone scoffed with a motion Sweetie assumed was an eye roll. "You know he won't," Pharynx shot back. "He's been terrified of you and your Princess ever since the Queens surrendered. The letters he sent me were all about how things would be better for everyling after Equestria had beaten Chrysalis. He doesn't talk about any of that anymore. It's not as annoying as his insufferable optimism was, but..." He let out a low hiss. "You're just here to keep us all following orders, right?"\n\n"Yes," she replied flatly.\n\nPharynx stared at the Director for a few moments. "I was wrong," he decided as he turned to leave.

equestria_celestia.30.d:0 "King Thorax read over the letter once more, a look of concern in his eyes. It had been sent from Equestria, brought by pony courtier all the way to Vesalipolis. Penned by a 'Raven Inkwell', it gave an official and 'long overdue' congratulations to him for staying true to the principles of harmony from Princess Celestia herself. There were a few other platitudes, a bit about how Equestria was looking forward to better cooperation and relations between changelings and ponies. Assurances that they would be taking a more proactive stance on defending harmony across Equus and beyond in the future. All things that Thorax was happy to agree with.\n\nThere were other parts of the letter though, and those parts where what concerned him. Equestria wanted Thorax to officially join the Harmonic Accord, which was normally fine. But the wording was oddly insistent about it, like there was an expectation of agreement behind it. Not only that, but Equestria also wanted to send agents of S.M.I.L.E. as attachés to 'help root out any remaining Chrysalis loyalists' in the hives, despite Thorax being fairly certain that those had been dealt with. And there was a threatening feeling around the whole message, as if would be consequences for denying Princess Celestia her wishes...\n\n"It's a trap," his brother Pharynx warned. "They don't want you to be their 'friend' or whatever you call them, they want you to be their puppet. This is why the old ways told us never to interact with the ponies more than necessary."\n\n"The old ways also had every queen banish everydrone who disagreed with her to the frozen wastes outside the hives," Thorax reminded his brother. "They're called the old ways for a reason. Besides, I think Chrysalis didn't really care about following that rule either."\n\n"Hey, I never said the old ways were perfect. And Chrysalis wasn't either; that's why you're the king now. But at least she wasn't giving away all the hives to a bunch of ponies. I thought I made you hit yourself enough times to knock some sense into that head of yours."\n\nThorax didn't respond. He only stared at the letter he held in his hooves, his mind racing. Everything he had learned from the ponies told him that Pharynx was just being paranoid. Everything he had learned from Pharynx told him that the ponies were only using him to get what they wanted. Perhaps both were correct, but Thorax knew only one thing for certain; no matter what he chose, there would be consequences."

Doing her best to hide her irritation, she trotted into the throne room of Vesalipolis.\n\nThorax was sitting on the throne at its center. It was far too big for him; built for a changeling queen rather than a drone, he looked vastly out of place. "Director Drops!" he called out as he stood up to fly down from the dais. "I'm so glad you could make it. There's an issue I wanted to talk about."\n\n"What can I do to help?" Sweetie asked, feigning interest. Going back into her 'Bon Bon' persona helped. "I hope it isn't anything too serious."\n\n"Well, my brother Pharynx has been telling me that ponies have been rooting out changelings loyal to Chrysalis without telling us about it. That you've been meeting with the Queens behind my back. That isn't true, is it?"\n\n"Of course not. I have no idea what he's talking about."\n\nThorax frowned. "I was hoping you weren't going to lie. Pharynx?" A purple-eyed drone flew into the room with a large burlap sack. A single pony tumbled out of it. "He didn't tell us anything, but Pharynx searched his room and found enough. You're supposed to tell me when you're doing stuff like this, and you're definitely not supposed to be spying on us."\n\n"We are here to protect Equestria," Director Drops replied coldly, any pretenses of friendship fading away. "Whether you know of our activities or not is irrelevant. S.M.I.L.E. serves the Princess, not you." Sweetie Drops walked straight up to Thorax. "Now do I need to expect any more interference with our operations here?"\n\nIt was hard to tell with changelings, but the so-called King flicked his eyes to the collar of her coat and the familiar emblem of her agency. "...No."\n\nShe nodded. "Good. Then our business here is finished. Equestria thanks you for your service, King Thorax. As long as you stay loyal to harmony, you'll have nothing to fear from us.""

It was Lyra's office of course, given that nopony was allowed in Sweetie's save the Princess herself. "Don't you think that's a bit of a silly question?" the earth pony responded.\n\n"Is it?" Lyra bit her lip. "I don't like being an agent anymore, Bon Bon. You made the job sound so cool, hunting down monsters and being super secret with nopony else knowing. But now we call everything a monster. We spy on everypony, even ones we say we've forgiven. We aren't making friends, we're just here to control everything."\n\nSweetie Drops rubbed her eyes with her hooves, blinking tiredly. "Things have changed a lot," she admitted. "We're still only doing what's necessary to keep everypony safe. It's a dangerous world out there."\n\n"No. It's not." The unicorn pointed a hoof at her. "It's only dangerous because we call it that. Look at what we did to the changelings, Bon Bon! Thorax thought we were friends, and now he's terrified of us. Is that what we're supposed to be doing?"\n\n"Thorax was in over his head. It's for his own good. Look, I know you've disagreed with some of the things I've done recently, but we're still best friends, right? I'm still just Bon Bon to you."\n\nLyra Heartstrings shook her head, unable to meet the Director's eyes. "You aren't Bon Bon," she said quietly. "You're Director Sweetie Drops. I haven't seen Bon Bon in a long time."\n\nThe cream-colored mare didn't answer. The only sounds were the constant ticking on the wall from the clock, marking the seconds passing by.

After all the resentment and hatred that Celestia had shown towards them, she couldn't imagine it being anything but a trap. There were visions of S.M.I.L.E. agents hauling them off to Tartarus to spend the rest of their days among monsters, visions that only intensified when the palace staff seemed highly reluctant to allow her to attend. But after what happened to the changelings, she needed to be here.\n\nOr perhaps she didn't. The dinner was proceeding without incident, and as drinks were passed around the mood only seemed to lighten. Perhaps the hippogriffs being here had forced Celestia to hold back. Or maybe she really was genuine about trying to put the past behind her. Either way it seemed that Twilight's fears were unfounded, especially as she talked with Skystar and Novo about the great progress Carrot Stick had made in reforming the country.\n\n"Would anypony like dessert?" Twilight looked over and nearly jumped out of her chair seeing Sweetie Drops standing nearby. "What?" she asked at the alicorn's look of shock. "I still bake, you know. Cupcake?"\n\nCautiously taking two in her magic and levitating one over to Skystar, Twilight looked over at the other plate Bon Bon was holding. "What about those?" she asked, pointing at the hard candy arranged on it.\n\n"Sorry, those are for our special guests tonight. I can make some for you some other time." With a small bow the Director trotted away towards Celestia and the Chiropterrans.\n\n"I hope this party wraps up soon," Novo said as she looked out the window. "It's getting late."\n\nTwilight blinked; where had the time gone? It seemed like just minutes ago the sun was still illuminating the horizon, and now the moon had fully taken its place in the night sky. Celestia must have moved them while her attention had been elsewhere. "I'm sure Celestia will end it in a bit," the Princess of Friendship reassured her. "We all know you had a long trip here."\n\nThe Mare in the Moon watched from above as Celestia stood, the table falling silent."
equestria_celestia.41.a:0 "Time to close out."

equestria_celestia.42.t:0 "The Princess Remembers"
equestria_celestia.42.d:0 ""The past years for Equestria have been difficult," Celestia said to the ponies and hippogriffs present. "but we survived it all the same. Mistakes were made along the way, but harmony has come out stronger from it all. Is there no better proof than the Chiropterrans, now here as friends?"\n\nThe listeners nodded, with some even giving cheers of approval. They waved their mugs of cider around. The princess let them have their fun, downing their drinks with their laughs and smiles. "Yes, friends. Friends who sought the demise of Equestria for countless years. Friends who took every action to subvert and destroy harmony from within. Friends who killed my sister."\n\nThe room feel eerily silent. Ponies shifted uneasily in the chairs, Princess Twilight most of all. The alicorn of the sun continued on, her voice returning to a coldness Twilight had become all too familiar with. "You came here with your false promises to earn the trust of my sister and I, only to do everything in your power to destroy everything we held dear. But you made one mistake."\n\nCelestia's eyes glinted.\n\n"You didn't finish the job."\n\nA Chiropterran coughed into her hoof, the mare's eyes widening as it came back coated in blood. Another followed suit. The sounds of gargled choking filled the room as ponies stumbled out of their seats, blood splattering onto the tiled floor.\n\n"Leave one timberwolf alive, and ponies will never be safe," Celestia said. She barely reacted when Carrot Stick turned to her with a look of horror before he too coughed up blood onto the alicorn's horseshoes. Bodies fell to the floor, and when the sounds of suffering finally stopped echoing the only creatures left at the table were Celestia, Twilight and the hippogriffs.\n\n"This is my forgiveness," the former finished. "This is my mercy.""

equestria_celestia.43.d:0 ""M-mother?" Novo snapped out of her shock to see her daughter Skystar on the verge of breaking down into tears. "Can I go back to our room?\n\n"...Of course, Skystar. Everygriff, go with her. I'll be there soon." The royal family save for Novo slowly filed out of the room. Twilight already knew what she was going to say; it was the same thing Twilight herself would had she the courage to speak up. "What did you do?"\n\n"What was necessary."\n\n"You call this necessary?" Novo stood up and pointed at the bodies on the floor. Twilight tried to ignore the ones still twitching. "This was nothing but you wanting revenge. You wanted someone to blame and you lied to everyone to fulfill your fantasies.\n\n"Fantasies?" Celestia stood as well, her neutral expression returning to cold fury. "I will tell you what is a fantasy. A fantasy is believing that these creatures deserved a second chance after the thousands of deaths they've caused. Of believing that they could embrace harmony instead of pretending to do so to avoid justice. Of putting your trust in him-" Celestia spat the word out with vitriol as he pointed at Carrot Stick's body "-of all creatures, a pony directly complicit in taking my sister from me. That is the fantasy you tried to live."\n\n"Forgiveness is what you taught us," the queen shot back. "I do not know what happened to my friend, but I can clearly see now that she is gone. The Celestia I knew would never lie to me. The hippogriffs will not forget this insult, and we will-"\n\n"You will do nothing. Your words are nothing but empty threats. You may say all you like about what I have done, but you will do nothing about it because there is nothing you can do. Because you know what will happen if you try." As if on cue a dark rose unicorn with a broken horn stepped out into the moonlight. Tempest Shadow's horn sparked.\n\n"You... you wouldn't..." Novo searched Celestia's eyes for anything, any hint of emotion past the cold void. She found none. The queen of the hippogriffs flew off, her head hung in defeat.\n\nTwilight stared at Tempest, then at the pony she once called a teacher. Then in a flash of purple light, she was gone."

equestria_darkwar.1.t:0 "Poison at the Heart"
equestria_darkwar.1.d:0 "It had started as a chance meeting. A run-in within the halls of Canterlot Palace. Chancellor Neighsay and Fancy Pants, nearly slamming into each other as they rounded a corner. "Ah, I was wondering when I'd run into you," Fancy said. "The reports you requested are ready in the east wing."\n\n"Reports?" Neighsay raised an eyebrow. "I never requested any reports. Everything is brought directly to my office. Are you certain it was me?"\n\n"Well, who else would want reports on Canterlot's latest research..." Fancy Pants trailed off. His eyes widened in horror, and he stared behind Neighsay as Director Sweetie Drops and Agent Lyra Heartstrings approached from behind. "Director!" he called out. "I believe we may have a problem in the palace!"\n\nSweetie lowered her sunglasses and raised an eyebrow. "Lyra?"\n\n"Yes, director?"\n\nThe earth pony whipped out her pistol and fired it straight into Lyra's head. The mare fell to the floor, a changeling taking her place in a flash of green fire. It wasn't even a second later before Neighsay and Fancy found themselves at gunpoint. "Klutzy?" Director Drops asked warningly.\n\n"Draconequus," both answered back simultaneously.\n\nSweetie frowned and lowered her pistol. "That'll have to do for now," she said sparing a glance back at the dead changeling. "She still calls me Bon-Bon. Fancy Pants, order a full lockdown of the palace. Neighsay, I want every unicorn available on standby to cast detection spells. Assume nopony is safe. S.M.I.L.E. will handle things from there."\n\nFancy nodded and immediately began trotting off, while Neighsay paused for a moment to stare suspiciously at the director. His horn ignited causing the earth pony to glow faintly for a second. The Director smirked. "Looks like you're finally learning."\n\n"That is my job, Director Drops.""

olenia_uprising.1.d:0 ""Is it time?"\n\nThe S.M.I.L.E. operative, a snow-white pony who had given the name 'Foxtrot' to the Olenians checked her watch. "One more minute," she said as the hands approached midnight. "Have you made sure everypony is ready?"\n\n"Everydeer," the Olenian corrected, "and we've been ready for weeks." Taking a hold of his rifle, he pulled back the bolt to let the next round slide into the chamber. "Though we all owe you a great debt for helping us secure these changeling weapons and keeping communication between cells open. The collaborators are incompetent, but the Heer is effective at keeping us spread thin."\n\n"Fighting the bugs is payment enough. Once you seize Hjortland, Equestria will ship supplies and reinforcements in to secure the peninsula. Queen Velvet will arrive to establish a new government when it is safe enough to do so."\n\nThe stag nodded. "I suppose there is some irony in these things," he commented as moonlight began breaking through the treeline. "The changelings have done what no Olenian has before, and bought unity to all deer against a common enemy. I supported King Johan before, you know. My father was a noble threatened by Velvet's reforms, so she was the enemy. But better a doe upon the throne than a foreigner."\n\n"Fair enough." Foxtrot checked her watch again. "It's midnight. Are you ready?"\n\nPulling out a flare gun, the stag grinned. "Of course. We have been waiting a long time for this."\n\nAnd as the flares rose over the sea of trees, the first echoes of gunfire rang through the Hjortland Peninsula."

olenia_uprising.2.t:0 "Return of the Queen"
olenia_uprising.2.d:0 "Hjortland was free. The flag of the Olenian Protectorate had been burned, and one of the true Kingdom had been raised in its place above the Riksdag. Bodies swung in the streets, as changelings and collaborationists alike were strung up by the communists. The church and zealots preferred beheadings. Only the harmonists and the Equestrian Army had taken prisoners, those deemed worthy of a trial post-war with the rest being sent to the firing squad.\n\nBut none of that concerned Queen Velvet. Perhaps it would later, but presently her attention was focused on a greater task; the total liberation of Olenia. To that end she had gathered those of importance in the royal palace, namely S.M.I.L.E.'s Agent Foxtrot.\n\n"The Protectorate has completely collapsed," Foxtrot reported in first. "Resistance is at an all-time high and the Heer is having to deal with it personally, but we were unable to locate Hjortsling himself."\n\n"That is because I already dealt with that traitor personally," Velvet answered dismissively. "You may still find shards of him outside if you wish. Thee bugs are the issue now."\n\n"Right," Foxtrot wiped her icy hooves on the rug. "We've organized Olenian volunteers for the new army. Marshal Manntlerhim will lead them to liberate the rest of Olenia and hopefully link up with the Equestrian front."\n\n"Good. I have waited too long to watch the bugs freeze."\n\nFoxtrot shifted. "Queen Velvet, S.M.I.L.E. believes you should stay in Hjortland. If the changelings were to capture you, the resistance could break into infighting again."\n\nVelvet raised an eyebrow. "You think I am the one in danger?" Her laugh was dainty yet cold as ice. "No. They will find that I am the danger. I am not Queen because of blood, like my brother. Olenia fights because I fight, for I have the strength to lead them into battle myself. That is the way of the old kings, and I will win my crown back just as they did."\n\nThe Queen of Olenia looked out the window, where the snow was beginning to fall again. "I will not forget my debt to you, Equestrian. But this is our war as well. Now, we fight together.""

equestria.3.t:0 "Help from the Ponies"
equestria.3.d:0 "Frosty Gust watched as ponies unloaded the crates of guns, medical supplies and other necessities off the carriages, hoofing them over to a few Yaks waiting impatiently nearby. It had been a difficult trip, traveling through the Crystal Empire and across the Yak Range using underdeveloped roads and trails to finally make it to Yakistown. Had she known the time and danger involved in the trip, she probably wouldn't have volunteered to lead the expedition in the first place. She was pretty sure at least five years of her lifespan were gone from those avalanches.\n\nPrince Rutherford looked from the military equipment to Frosty; he had arrived to personally oversee the transfer. "Yaks appreciate pony help!" he said loudly, as was the norm for all yaks. "Yaks and ponies live in dangerous times! Become harder to SMASH enemies, need work together!"\n\n"Yes, of course," she replied, trying to remember the basics she learned in Yak diplomacy. "Equestria will always stand by our friends, and we know how important it is to help you as much as we can."\n\nThere was a crash. A few ponies had dropped one of the crates, letting rifles spill out from the top. The Prince picked one of them up and studied it closely. "This pony weapon, not yak made," he said, anger slowly rising. "Pony weapons not for yaks, not perfect. When things not perfect, make yaks mad! Makes yaks want to destroy!"\n\nThe pony winced. This was exactly what she had been told not to let happen when it came to diplomacy with yaks. "Well, um, you see," she said, trying to do damage control. "We can't really, uh, I meant we tried to-"\n\nThe yak prince nodded before giving the rifle to another yak, who started helping the ponies gather the fallen weapons. "Yaks mad, but yaks also understand not everything perfect anymore," Rutherford said. "Yaks need weapons, can't afford to SMASH. Pony help important, yaks not forget!"\n\nFrosty breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed not everything the ponies back in Canterlot told her was true after all. "If you need anything else from Equestria, all you have to do is ask. We will always be ready to help a friend in need.""

equestria.4.t:0 "The Equestrian-Yak Treaty of Friendship"
equestria.4.d:0 "Equestria was not a nation known for war. Rather, it was known for its peace, friendship and diplomacy, all things they took very seriously. Nothing symbolized that seriousness more than the long scroll that had been brought to Prince Rutherford, expertly written in elegant ponish on the finest Equestrian parchment, and already signed by both diarchs of Equestria. There was just one small problem with it.\n\nAlmost no yak could read the exceedingly formal script. Fortunately, an official diplomat had been sent from Canterlot with the entire document already memorized to read aloud to the yaks of Rutherford's court. Unfortunately, Pinkie Pie had also decided to give commentary on the exceedingly formal language of the document, which was a blessing or a curse depending on who you asked in the room.\n\n"...which hereby solidifies cordial relations between the Principality of Equestria and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan in perpetuity, agreed upon by the sovereigns of each nation." The diplomat, an old earth pony stallion with a long grey beard, finally finished his reading of the treaty and bowed to the Prince and his entourage, who all looked to Pinkie Pie standing off to the side.\n\n"What he means is that we all Pinkie Promise to always be super duper friends and help each other out whenever we need it! It also means that I can throw the biggest party in Yakyakistan EVER!" Pinkie was already bouncing up and down at the mere thought of it, while the Prince and the other yaks nodded before looking at each other. Rutherford stomped once - the elders stomped back. They nodded at him - he nodded back.\n\n"Yakyakistan still in difficult time!" he finally proclaimed, causing even Pinkie to stop bouncing and listen attentively. "Many disagreements between yaks, still needs fixing! Yaks believe we need focus on yak issues, not pony issues!"\n\nPinkie frowned, and her mane threatened to deflate like it did during the yovidaphone incident. "PINK PONY NO CRY YET!" Rutherford yelled loud enough to shake the pony's eyeballs around. "Yak never forget friendship. Friendship of pink pony, and all ponyland! When pony call, yak will always answer!" Another yak brought forth an almost comedically large quill, which the Prince used to sign the document before adding his royal seal with a loud slam.\n\nThe excitement in Pinkie's eyes returned faster than the snap of a hoof. "Yay!" she said bouncing all across the room. "Ooh, I'll need to get my super-duper party cannon for this one! Come on, we have a party to throw!" The Equestrian diplomat, who had only nodded politely and had turned to leave found himself dragged faster than the speed of sound out the door by the party pony, the yaks all laughing uproariously at the antics of their old new friend."

equestria.5.t:0 "Arrival of the Exiles"
equestria.5.d:0 "The last time Prince Rutherford had visited Equestria in a manner like this, it had nearly ended with the Kingdom of Yakyakistan declaring war upon Equestria. One could perhaps, if looking for it, find irony in the fact then that he had returned not as a Prince, or as an enemy, but as an exile. Him and thousands of other yaks, all following their former monarch to the first friends they found outside of Yakyakistan. Pinkie Pie had personally requested (or demanded according to some) to accompany the yaks from Whinnyapolis to their destination of Canterlot. Now she stood with an oddly contemplative expression to one side as the Prince stood before Princess Celestia, alone on her throne.\n\n"We are deeply troubled by the news coming out of Yakyakistan," the alicorn said to Rutherford and his entourage consisting of a few elders who had chosen to come with him in exile and the former student of the School of Friendship, Yona. "I wish we only could have done more to help before it was too late. Should you wish to stay, Equestria will welcome you with open hooves for as long as you need."\n\nThe yak nodded in agreement. "Home of yaks fall to evil forces. Ponyland also in danger by same forces! Yaks fight with ponies, make sure not suffer same fate as Yakyakistan!"\n\nYona stepped forward as well, the Prince giving a nod in agreement to allow her to speak. "Maybe yaks return home to Yakyakistan someday, maybe not," she said, her voice laced with just a twinge of bitterness which quickly disappeared. "But yaks never let down pony friends no matter what! Yaks protect Equestria, just like ponies do!"\n\nPinkie looked at Yona and Rutherford for a second before her head turned to see Celestia's response, a single light nod. "Equestria would never refuse help from its friends," she said softly, at least compared to the yaks.\n\n"Good!" Rutherford practically yelled back. "Pony princess have no choice in matter anyway. Exile makes yaks mad, want to SMASH something!" All the yaks barring Yona started stomping the ground as hard as they could, which was thankfully magically reinforced. All the commotion caused the Royal Guards to storm in to see what the noise was, then staring confused at the display of violence against the palace floor.\n\nAnd despite everything, the slightest twinge of a smile tugged at Celestia's muzzle."

This is an insult to all buffalo!"\n\n"It's not like that at all!" Little Strongheart argued back, shouting above the cries of many buffalo who voiced their dissent. "The ponies are our friends, and they just want to help us! But they can't do that if we keep to ourselves and fight against everything different! Joining Equestria doesn't make us any less of who we are!"\n\nMany more buffalo started talking amongst themselves, seeming to agree with Strongheart's words. "It gets rid of everything we are!" the Elder shot back, outraged. "We would consign ourselves to a future chosen by ponies, not buffalo! They will never have our interests in mind, nor do they care for our traditions. The fact we are even considering this is an affront to all our ancestors!"\n\nThunderhooves grunted in deep contemplation. "The Equestrians have taken much from us already," he said slowly and authoritatively. Many buffalo nearby nodded. "The buffalo have lasted for centuries on our own. We do not need the ponies to solve our issues."\n\n"But we don't need to do everything on our own either," Strongheart pleaded. "Please, understand that this isn't the end for anything we care about. It's just accepting the friendship that Equestria is offering us."\n\nThe Chief Council lasted long into the night, but by morning a decision was finally made..."

"Little Strongheart, are you sure that you want to do this? I know that your traditions mean a lot to you, and to all the buffalo. It feels weird to give up all of that now, after everything you did to protect it."\n\nThe buffalo jumped over to Dash, giving a reassuring smile. "Dash, whether we call ourselves Equestrians or not doesn't change who we are. We keep our traditions alive by how we act and what we do, not through keeping ourselves separate from others. Besides, I believe we can learn a lot from pony traditions, just like how you can learn from us!"\n\n"Yeah, but still..." The frown remained plastered on the pegasi's muzzle.\n\n"Dash, friends trust each other, right?"\n\n"Yeah?"\n\n"And we're friends, right?"\n\n"Obviously."\n\n"Then let us trust you to treat our traditions with respect," Strongheart said resolutely.

Celestia did not mind the use of her archaic title; it was one the buffalo had retained for her, even as the centuries passed and it was lost in the minds of others.\n\n"Thank you." The buffalo took a few steps forward, seemingly a bit reluctant to speak at first. "I came here today because I was talking with some of the other buffalo, and we decided that we should do something to defend Equestria too!"\n\nThe princess tilted her head slightly at the sudden outburst. "What do you mean by that?" she asked, more curious than confused.\n\nStrongheart wasted no time in continuing, regaining her confidence as she did so. "We learned years ago that you have to be ready to fight to protect your traditions. Buffalo and ponies may have had differences, but all of us need to work together now to protect them! So please, let us stay here and do our part!"\n\n"But what about your home?" Celestia asked. "Aren't you needed there to lead?"\n\n"Equestria is my home, Day Bringer. And Chief Thunderhooves agreed that I could do more for the buffalo here in Canterlot while he remains chief of the tribes. This is what I want to do."\n\nCelestia gently nodded. "Then of course you can stay here, Little Strongheart." Standing up from her throne, the alicorn walked down to stand in front of the buffalo, her face full of gratitude and kindness.

As the truth is slowly revealed about the true motives behind the thestral integration movement and its troubles, many ponies now question what place the fourth tribe has in Equestrian society, even as Equestria itself is under attack. In the palace itself, whatever staff have remained loyal scramble to muster a response and mobilize Equestria against the new threat, even while the Princess locks herself away behind closed doors.\n\nIn the east, harmony has been replaced with the rule of the Nightmare, who has arrived in Manehattan to lead her armies against her sister. With the help of the Chiropterrans, who have finally come out of the shadows to wage their war over a thousand years in the making, thousands of ponies have armed themselves to overthrow the Sun Princess and the west, marching on Canterlot, Bales, Whinnyapolis and beyond. Despite the early springing of their plot keeping them at a disadvantage, many expect that Equestria will fall quickly against the might of the newly-proclaimed Lunar Empire.\n\nAs the lines are drawn in the dirt, brother goes against brother and Equestria, once the land of friendship and harmony, finds itself split in twain. Nopony knows who will be left standing when the dust settles, but only one thing is for certain; Equestria will never be the same."

Prince Blueblood (my coworker, don't ask) and I are working day and night now to get things under control after Princess Luna became Nightmare Moon again (and don't ask Vice Principal Luna anything about this, I don't think she would appreciate it). Twilight (not you, the Princess Twilight over here) is just trying to keep Equestria from falling apart even more, and whenever I see her she looks even more exhausted then you do whenever you spend an all-nighter making something for the school science fair!\n\nBy the way, how are things going over there? Time works differently across the portal so I'm not entirely sure how long its been for all of you, but I think you girls are all still on break, right? I hope all of you can still enjoy the rest of your time off without me. I'll try to be back as soon as I can, once Equestria is safe and Princess Twilight doesn't need me here anymore. I also made sure to bring the picture Photo Finish took of us at the cornucopia, though I keep it hidden away from everypony else. It would be a bit weird explaining why I have a picture of all of Princess Twilight's friends here.\n\nWell, that's all I've got for now. Make sure to write back to me soon! I want to hear everything going on, especially if any more Equestrian magic gets loose again. (And no, Rainbow Dash, I will not help you cheat on your homework by just giving you the answers. Ask Twilight instead.) Anyway, I miss all you girls, and I hope I'll get to see you all in person again soon.\n\nYour friend,\nSunset Shimmer"

POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Long ago, in the lands known as Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for the realm and all their subjects. The tales of these sisters stretch back far beyond recorded history, and their achievements in defeating Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and other terrors have become legendary.\n\nPrincess Celestia is the elder of the two sisters, and the Princess of the Sun along with her traditional role as a diarch of Equestria. Charged with raising the sun and until recently the moon, it was she who was responsible for banishing her own sister Princess Luna to the moon following her fall into darkness, as well as the thousand years of relative peace and prosperity that followed. Through it all she has ruled with a light hoof, only stepping in when necessary to preserve harmony throughout the realm. And though all of Equestria had forgotten Luna, it was Celestia who remembered her sister and welcomed her back following the defeat of Nightmare Moon by Twilight Sparkle.\n\nSince that fateful day, much has transpired in Equestria. The changelings led by Queen Chrysalis came close to capturing Canterlot in 1002, and attacks by both a resurgent King Sombra and Lord Tirek have only been barely repulsed by Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Still, Celestia is not blind to the threats that lay both within and without Equestria's borders. The enemies of harmony can no longer be defeated by friendship and magic, and only time will tell if Equestria's greatest proponent of peace, kindness and cooperation can keep up with the modern era of technology and progress.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Taken by the darkness I was too blind to see. No longer will Equestria be taken advantage of by the monsters that lurk in the world, by the enemies of harmony who seek only death and destruction.

POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the onslaught of a merciless war leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far more totalitarian. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready to give their all to protect Equestria.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

Though not necessarily the most humble politician, Blueblood knows how, when, and what to say what the public wants to hear, knows what the public wants, and has the intellect to carry out their will efficiently.

Traveling to the far north of Severyana, she tried building a new life in what would become Our Town alongside her future new friends; Night Glider, Party Favor and Double Diamond.\n\nHowever, the dream she was promised quickly turned into a living nightmare. With her cutie mark taken away, Sugar Belle's desire to regain her old talent was buried until the Element Bearers arrived one day, a rare visit grudgingly allowed by the Stalliongradian Soviet. Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends revealed Starlight Glimmer's ideology as a sham, resulting in everypony's cutie marks returning with Starlight being run out of the village, and ultimately the reannexation of 'Our Town' into Stalliongrad. For most residents, it was a small price to pay for the return of what made them special.\n\nSugar Belle saw things differently. When she looked at communism, she saw the same lies Starlight had used. They had been quick to distance themselves from Equalism, but there was a reason the Soviet approved the village in the first place. So she looked elsewhere for answers, and found them right in the hooves of a resurgent S.M.I.L.E. looking for agents. She fed them all the information she could, receiving food supplies in return.\n\nThis all culminated in decisive action once war broke out between Stalliongrad and Equestria. Sugar Belle prepared for an armed insurrection, working with her friends and using weapons delivered by the now love of her life, Big Macintosh. Now head of the 'Severyana Liberation Movement', she stands for Equestria knowing full well it is little more than a distraction for the Red Army. And while few know the truth of her role as an agent, everypony with her stands united in loyalty to friendship and harmony.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

EQS_BLUEBLOOD_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of September, 971 in Canterlot\n\n§YRank§!: Field Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Adoptive nephew of Princess Celestia and the scion of the House of Platinum, Prince Blueblood knows very little of a life outside of Canterlot. Raised in the palace with all the prestige and notoriety that the only informal relative to Princess Celestia at the time had, Blueblood soon found that less and less of his aunt's time was devoted to him in favor of the newly-ascended Princess Cadance, her first student Sunset Shimmer, and later her second and future Princess Twilight Sparkle. Rather than complain, which he believed to be ill-fitting of a pony of his position, he instead utilized his free time immersing himself at the head of Equestrian high society.\n\nThis continued for quite some time, and barring a brief debacle involving a Grand Galloping Gala and the Element Bearer of Generosity Blueblood remained a relatively stable fixture of the wealthy in Canterlot. Even following the Canterlot Attack in 1002, when the army reforms were just beginning, Blueblood used his relation to Princess Celestia and his influence in Canterlot to secure the rank of the first Equestrian Field Marshal, practically a purely ceremonial title at the time. However, everything changed in 1005.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Ain Trotgourait and a private talk with his aunt, Blueblood threw himself with surprising seriousness into his newly assigned duties of reforming the Equestrian armed forces by modern standards. Palace officials found him studying Griffonian and Zebrican tactics, histories of warfare, and foreign military organization. And while outsiders would say he is still woefully unskilled compared to his foreign counterparts, no Equestrian can deny he already knows much more about warfare than most other ponies in the peaceful land.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_SPITFIRE_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of November, 979 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Chief Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in the most famous pegasus cloud city in all of Equestria, Spitfire did not start out as the talented flyer she is known as today. In fact, compared to the other future Wonderbolts as fillies, she was relatively unremarkable; just another foal racing to be the fastest. Almost nopony could have suspected what future was in store for her, nor the sheer amount of time, effort and dedication she put in to being the most skilled pegasi in Cloudsdale. It was never natural talent that carried her, but an unshakable force of determination and diligence to do her best and then some.\n\nOnce she came of age, Spitfire easily won the Best Young Flyer competition in Cloudsdale that year, gaining the attention of the Wonderbolts. Applying herself to running through the Wonderbolts Academy with top marks, the Wonderbolt Captain before her pulled her aside and explained that he would soon be retiring, and that he wanted her to take his place when the time came. He saw that the Wonderbolts of tomorrow would be defined not by their raw talent, but by how hard they could push themselves to be better than they were yesterday. And by 998, Spitfire had broken the academy record for fastest promotion to Captain of the Wonderbolts.\n\nIn the last decade, Spitfire has taken on many positions from leading Wonderbolt aerial shows to acting as drill sergeant for the Wonderbolts Academy and, following the Battle of Ain Trotgourait in 1005, the formal military position of Air Chief Marshal and the task of creating a new Equestrian air force. And working with her new direct superior Prince Blueblood, Spitfire has taken to learning about the age of aircraft just as seriously as she had the Wonderbolts years prior. Equestria will control the skies just as much as the ground if she has anything to say about it - failure is not in her dictionary.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
EQS_SOARIN_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of August, 980 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: As a foal, Soarin never had the grand ambitions that many other prospective Wonderbolts had. In fact, he had never dreamed of becoming one in the first place. In his mind, his future was one in the weather factory much like his parents, living the easy life. Fate however had other ideas in store, once he found his talent in the skies outflying many of his fellow fillies and colts.\n\nSoarin did not win the year he entered the Best Young Flyer Competition; that honor went to Fleetfoot. That did not stop the Wonderbolts from offering him an acceptance letter to the Academy, which he took at the advice of his friends and family. Soarin was not a star student, but his peers respected him for other reasons; he was not preoccupied with being the best as much as he was having fun. Such a relaxed attitude made him many friends, and when he became a full-fledged Wonderbolt he quickly became one of the most renowned in Equestria for his easygoing nature.\n\nThis notoriety helped him become the official second-in-command of the Wonderbolts in 1002 right before the Canterlot attack, but it was only in 1005 after Ain Trotgourait that he was given the military rank of Air Marshal. Soarin prefers to handle the more administrative parts of the army and air force, as well as aiding Spitfire in the various duties as an officer. And while he'll never turn down a slice of apple pie, everypony knows he takes his job just as seriously as anypony else would.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
EQS_FLEETFOOT_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of February, 981 in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Air Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: When one thinks of raw talent in a pegasus, their mind would usually go to a pony such as the legendary Rainbow Dash or until recently Lightning Dust. Few would remember that Fleetfoot was right alongside them since the very beginning. A filly with the speed and agility to go far, she saw the path in her life from the start; an easy road to the Wonderbolts, to fame, and eventually taking her place as one of the fastest flyers of Equestria.\n\nHowever, things would not come so easily for the filly. She soon found herself outclassed by the rising star Spitfire, and only barely managed to win against Soarin at the Best Young Flyer Competition. This, combined with her time in the Wonderbolts Academy helped Fleetfoot realize that it is not just about natural talent, but also how much you can apply yourself using it. With that in mind she turned over a new leaf, studying the moves of Wonderbolts past and watching and listening to her fellow cadets to improve her own skills, eventually resulting in graduating as a full Wonderbolt in almost record time.\n\nNowadays, Fleetfoot acts as one of the Wonderbolts' fastest flyers and as one of the newly-appointed Air Marshals alongside Soarin since 1005. She prefers the more hooves-on aspects of her officer's role, test-flying new generations of fighter planes and giving feedback to Spitfire on their practical applications. To her, flying is still a serious business whether it be by wing or by plane, and she'd rather stay grounded than be in the air without skill, speed and style.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
EQS_FLASHMAGNUS_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown Date, in Cloudsdale\n\n§YRank§!: Captain of the Royal Guard\n\n§YBiography§!: Countless centuries ago, the Equestria that Flash Magnus lived in was a far different land. Not much is known of his early life in ancient Cloudsdale, and what is known is mere speculation and legends passed down through the Canterlot and Cloudsdale Archives. But what the legends do say is impressive; wielding the legendary fireproof shield Netitus as a member of the Cloudsdale Royal Legion, he has faced dragons, thunderstorms, and the forces of darkness itself.\n\nLater legends, particularly those confirmed by Stygian tell Flash Magnus as a Pillar of Old Equestria, representing the Element of Bravery. Assembled by Stygian to face the threat of the sirens, he much like his fellow Pillars were sent to Limbo in an attempt to seal the Pony of Shadows, and was only saved in the present day by Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\n\nAfter a brief period of adjusting to modern society, Flash Magnus found himself under the employ of the Crown and the Princesses, becoming a drill sergeant for the woefully outdated Royal Guard. His dedication, loyalty and distinguished service, as well as the legends surrounding him all culminated in his promotion to Captain of the Royal Guard, replacing the absent Shining Armor. And while some may question having an ancient legionnaire reform the the institution, Flash is determined to show that an old stallion can still teach some new tricks.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "
EQS_SUNSET_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March, 974 in Prancisco\n\n§YRank§!: Field Marshal\n\n§YBiography§!: Sunset Shimmer has long been defined by one thing that has continued to drive her forward - ambition. As an orphaned filly in Prancisco, she took her natural gift at magic and turned it into her sole focus in life, accomplishing feats at a young age that many other unicorns could never do in their entire lives. Such early mastery of magic caught the attention of the School of Gifted Unicorns, and eventually even the eye of Princess Celestia herself. Such was her talent that the alicorn did something unprecedented in her long reign; she took on the unicorn as her own personal student, hoping to nurture her into becoming the Element of Magic.\n\nSunset's ambition proved too much for the Princess to handle however, and following an incident in 993 where she demanded to be made an alicorn Celestia banished her student from the castle. Instead of leaving, Sunset chose to flee through a magical mirror into an alternate dimension, where she stayed for almost a decade. It was only in 1002 shortly after Princess Twilight's coronation that she returned to steal the Element of Magic. The events that followed across the mirror are a secret known only by the Princesses and Twilight's closest friends.\n\nBarring a few more events involving Princess Twilight crossing the mirror again, very little was heard from Sunset Shimmer for some time. It was only after Equestria found itself in danger that she returned. With the intercession of Princess Twilight, Sunset was given a position as an Equestrian Field Marshal to the confusion of many. Nevertheless she has proven herself well in the position, even if many in the general staff find her relative youth and strange mannerisms confusing.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Having grown up in the southwestern rock farms, Maud spent much of her life studying to be admitted to the Equestrian Institute of Rockology. During her time studying for her degree in Rock Science she made many important geological discoveries such as the exploration of the Crystal Mountain Range cave systems, and she soon graduated with full honors as valerocktorian of her class.\n\nFollowing her studies, Maud moved into a gem cave near Ponyville and found a coltfriend, Mudbriar. While it was expected that she would continue her research into the many rocks of Equestria and their properties, many including her own sister Pinkie were surprised when she volunteered to lead the Equestrian Army alongside her sibling Limestone Pie. The exact reasoning remains a mystery, though some suspect that it stems from a desire to protect Pinkie from the horrors of war.\n\nMaud has a dry demeanor, monotonous tone of voice, and almost never smiles as a sharp contrast to her famous sister. Despite this attitude she still has a deep passion for rocks, and deeply loves her family. As a general she primarily leads a commando unit of earth ponies along with her sister Limestone, and acts as a first-degree combat geologist utilizing her vast geological knowledge alongside her incredible speed and tremendous physical strength. Soldiers say that if Maud Pie can't hold a defensive position, then nopony can.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"
EQS_LIMESTONE_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of March, 980 on the Pie Family Rock Farm\n\n§YRank§!: Lieutenant General\n\n§YBiography§!: As the oldest of the four Pie Sisters, Limestone Pie has rarely ever known a life outside the rock farm. Raised to be the inheritor of the farm and to carry on the Pie Family legacy, her entire childhood was spent learning the time-tested methods and traditions of the southwest, tending to and mining the rocks on the fields. Following Maud leaving to pursue her degree in Rock Science and Pinkie leaving to spread laughter across Equestria and settling in Ponyville, Limestone took over managing the farm from her parents and expected a long life of honest work alone ahead of her.\n\nThe war changed all that. When Limestone heard that her sister Maud was joining the army, she quickly left the farm back in the hooves of her parents and demanded to be made an officer as well. Given her almost inequine strength and a desire by multiple government officials not to have their bones shattered, she was made a Lieutenant General second-in-command to Maud Pie in the newly formed earth pony commando group. The rock farmer has taken to the role with the utmost seriousness, performing surprisingly well in leadership positions.\n\nLimestone is an incredibly aggressive and commanding pony, something that causes friction on occasion with superior officers. Nopony can deny her effectiveness in keeping discipline though, and many attribute to her the incredible effectiveness of the commandos whom she remains protective of. In her mind, they are all that stand between everything she loves whether it be her sisters, the rock farm or Holder's Boulder; everypony else can either fall in line behind them or get out of the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

But one fateful day, an encounter with an ursa minor left her horn shattered and her face scarred. Feeling abandoned by her friends who soon left for Canterlot to continue their studies without her, Fizzlepop eventually turned her back on Equestria and left seeking to find a new path in life and become a fearsome warrior, taking the name Tempest Shadow.\n\nAfter some brief adventures in Abyssinia and Klugetown involving the Misfortune Malachite, Tempest struck a deal with none other than the Storm King; in return for acting as his second-in-command and right hoof, he would restore her horn upon conquering Equestria. She accompanied and led his armies on their conquest of North Zebrica as a ruthless military leader, shoving all memories of her past in Equestria aside. It was only at that Battle of Ain Trotgourait when Princess Twilight Sparkle reminded her of the value in friendship and harmony, convincing her to betray the Storm King resulting in his death and a Hippogriffian victory over the invading forces.\n\nSince then, Fizzlepop had returned to Equestria with Twilight and traveled the nation seeking to help others in need and make a difference. And yet, no matter what she did, she never felt like she fit in or belonged in a peaceful land that knew nothing but friendship. So when Equestria came calling for new minds to help in its defense, Fizzlepop returned to take up a new command, this time under the flag of Harmony. Her blunt and cynical personality as well as her knowledge of war provides much to the command staff, and she is determined to prove herself and take any opportunity to defeat difficult opponents, whether that be in personal combat or with armies on the battlefield.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

It was during this time that she met the future Princess of Equestria, Twilight Sparkle, and discovered her role as the Bearer of the Element of Loyalty during Nightmare Moon's return in 1000.\n\nFollowing the return of Princess Luna to Equestria, Rainbow Dash's skills and fame only grew across Equestria. Finally gaining entrance to the Wonderbolts as a trainee in 1002, her dedication and loyalty made her a full-fledged member only two years later. She has played a major role in defeating many of Equestria's major magical threats over the previous decade, including Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and the Pony of Shadows. In more recent times, Rainbow has also become a teacher at Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship.\n\nRainbow is a brash, competitive and egotistical pony, albeit one who has the skills to back all of her claims of being 'the greatest flyer in all of Equestria'. But above all else she is loyal to her friends and to Equestria, and it is that loyalty that pushed her to seek a position in the new Equestrian Army as a general. Though unfocused and disorganized, she has proven to be an extremely dedicated and effective commander preferring to lead from the front with her troops in battle.

However, her reckless nature and leadership style of leading from the front caused a major combat injury in the form of losing her entire left wing. Now replaced with a prosthetic, many under her command regard the pegasus as more a force of nature than a military commander; her usually carefree and confident attitude replaced with nothing but cold unrelenting determination to achieve victory.

Born the third child of the Pie family near Rockville, she gained her cutie mark one day after witnessing Rainbow Dash's Sonic Rainboom, discovering that her special talent in life was spreading joy to other ponies. After moving to Ponyville she took up baking at Sugarcube Corner, and soon became the Bearer of the Element of Laughter while helping Twilight Sparkle defeat Nightmare Moon in the year 1000.\n\nSince then, Pinkie Pie has played a major role in defeating many of Equestria's threats, including King Sombra, Lord Tirek and the Pony of Shadows. As an honorary yak, she also served as the unofficial diplomat to the Kingdom of Yakyakistan during their exit from isolation under Prince Rutherford, and taught lessons at the School of Friendship about the role of laughter in harmony.\n\nIn the past, Pinkie Pie was an excitable, hyperactive and social pony, albeit with strange mannerisms and occasional insecurities. However, the recent war has drastically changed her personality, turning her into a distant and depressive, if determined general in the Equestrian Army. Most soldiers under her command appreciate her fourth-wall bending powers and experience in defending positions from her background as a rock farmer, but some of her aides whisper of regular emotional breakdowns and requests of leaving casualities out of operational reports. Still, her unique skillset has proven to be vital to the Equestrian war effort, and she continues to willingly serve in its defense despite the toll on her mental state.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: "

While she is earnest in reintegrating towards modern society, and earning the adoration of her subjects, Luna rarely enjoys the attention her elder sister, Princess Celestia, receives. Her efforts in guarding the dreams of ponies are greatly appreciated, but what is Luna's greatest contribution today is leading ponies in the field, much like in the glory days of old before Equestria's unification.

They were often two trots away from poverty, and thus it was no surprise that when their father enlisted for the Equestrian Guard, he took his children with him to Canterlot. Swift Wing received advanced education in one of Canterlot's private schools, and once she became eligible for enlistment, she joined a different unit than her father's. Swift Wing's constitution ensured she passed the most rigorous exercises, towering over most of the stallions (who were suitably intimidated). After Severyana rose up in rebellion, she did not side with her homeland, stressing that loyalty to Equestria comes first and foremost. During the first Changeling invasion in 1002, Swift Wing was blinded in her right eye when a stray grenade detonated too close. Undaunted by a major injury, she simply cobbled a makeshift eyepatch and cantered back to her duty.

She has joined the officer corps of the Equestrian Army, ready to use her reality-bending abilities to save her homeland.§!"
EQS_tempy_desc:0 "§gFormerly known as Tempest Shadow, Fizzlepop Berrytwist was the second-in-command of the Storm King himself. In her youth she was a regular unicorn filly and dreamt of enrolling in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, but then an ursa minor attacked her and broke her horn. Without her magic, her friends soon abandoned her and joined the School for Gifted Unicorns. Bitter and lonely, Fizzlepop left her homeland to Zebrica, where she eventually stumbled into the Storm King. Having tricked his soldiers and impressed him with his combative personality, the Storm King offered her the vacant position of second-in-command. She accepted and in return the Storm King promised to restore her horn once he had gained enough magical power to do so.\n\nWhile Storm King was preparing his ambitious invasion of Equestria, Twilight Sparkle and her friends encouraged Queen Novo of Hippogriffia to attack him. During the following Battle of Ain Trotgourait, Fizzlepop managed to capture Princess Twilight Sparkle. However, when she presented her bounty to Storm King, he still refused to restore her horn, which enraged Tempest. After a brief fight between the two, Twilight intervened and saved Tempest's life, and she in turn joined with her and ultimately defeated the Storm King, turning him to stone with his own magical artifact.\n\nNow she has returned to Equestria and embraced her former name, travelling the land and aiding fellow ponies. Her military experience is great and she is more than happy to aid us§!"
EQS_sunrise_moonshadow_desc:0 "Born in 978 ALB, Southern Equestrian countryside. Sunrise was raised in the farming family whose export is mainly rice. He was raised among his older brother whom he didn't like, Sunrise did not have such easy life in his childhood due to the fact that poverty is common in the rural region, Sunrise enjoyed the outside world despite knowing how good, robust and beautiful the cities are, but still, he is particularly fascinated by the forest, jungle world. In his free time he was usually walking through the forests, sometimes living in there. Soon the harsh jungle is like a paradise for him - he could easily live there for the rest of his life. Some time later Princess Luna and Celestia came to visit his little town. That's when his cutie mark appeared, after the princesses have blessed him. From that moment he sworn to serve the princesses as best as he could. One day a draftpony came to his little town. Sunrise was fascinated by the world he can see by going to the military, but also that he can finally fulfil his destiny to serve the princesses. Almost without thinking he agreed to join the Equestrian Armed Forces.\n\nAfter much dedication and hardship, his efforts came into fruition. He was quickly assigned to Royal Canterlot Division in 1001, intense and harsh training was common place in the elite division. Time's passed. One day his company was chosen to a special training with the Royal Canterlot Guards and the Lunar Guards to strengthen the coordination between those units, after the lessons have learned in the first changeling attack on Canterlot in 1002. During those specialized trainings, it has shown himself his natural talents, Sunrise was one of the best from all of his company or even the guards. He quickly ranked up and was assigned to the Lunar Guards as an officer. Then later, the general of Equestria. When the Great War starts, he has shown his natural skills in managing his armies in the forest."
EQS_cynosura_desc:0 "A member of Equestria's naval high command, Cynosura stands firm in her beliefs that a powerful navy is essential in securing a future of Equestrian success. Born from a middle class family in Manehattan, she spent much of her foalhood gazing at the busy harbours of her city; the youthful stories of New Mareland's founding and age-old tales of trades and journeys in the distant lands of Griffonia amazed Cynosura, from which she learned that both riches and dangers lie in the vast ocean and beyond. Inspired to venture through the seas in this new age, Cynosura sought to look beyond the horizon; her parents were inclusive about her career, and had her enrolled to the naval academy she wished for.\n\nCynosura joined the navy once she graduated, and soon her talents began to show. She was capable of navigating large fleets with exceptional efficiency during war games, likewise knowing how to deliver heavier strikes while taking less damage during simulations. Combining her passion with profession, she rose through the ranks, attaining the rank of Admiral, a position only few were able to achieve at her age. She never gave up on her belief, and insisted that a fleet in being was essential even at times of peace. However with only pirates as targets, a navy was hardly Equestria's concern. Only recently, with the storm of war rapidly approaching her horizon, Cynosura might perhaps finally see the opportunity to put her talents and creed at work."

LEADER_OLI_DESC:0 "Like many of the thestrals who were shunned and forgotten, Oli Equites lived with his fellow bat ponies in the caves, ignored by all. It was not the ideal kind of life, lacking comforts and acceptance, but as long as they had each other, the thestrals were content. This isolation was broken when Princess Luna led her campaign to bring the issue to the forefront of the Equestrian public. Her words captured Oli's thoughts and he went off, despite his parents' protests, into the world beyond the cave.\nHis first and foremost desire was to protect the harmony Luna preached, especially after the incident occurred. Although nopony was hurt, and the event may have actually contributed to achieving rights for thestrals, Oli wanted to ensure that such would never occur again, and he made his way to the nearest recruitment centre. After proving his worth through an arduous training regimen, Oli became one of the first non-commissioned bat pony officers in the Equestrian army, proudly serving for the diarchy."

EQS_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Equestria, reeling from the military defeats during the conflict with Stalliongrad rushed to produce prototype copies of the makeshift Stalliongrad vehicles. One tester, nearly overwhelmed by the exhaust choking the poorly ventilated interior, likened the experience to 'sitting inside of a fuel tank'. Critics of the project seized on the comment, and the nickname 'tank' stuck, with the true name quickly forgotten."

EQS_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Breezie"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Following the failure of initial designs to produce adequate results for the new role tanks were entering on the battlefield, Equestrian theorists finally came up with the Breezie towards the end of 1005. Fast, lightly armored, and mostly designed to engage in infantry and unarmored targets it was nevertheless the first major step in Equestrian tank development. Despite major design flaws, lack of Equestrian production meant it saw limited combat in the initial stages of the Great War."
EQS_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Breezie"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Seabreeze"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Seabreeze was in essence a modernized Breezie tank, given a larger gun able to penetrate armor and better protection to defend against similar light tanks while still remaining light and fast. The Seabreezes that were deployed in the Great War proved to be effective at fighting off changeling infantry offensives, but stood little chance against larger and more modern tank designs like the Panzers the Heer was already mass producing."
EQS_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Seabreeze"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Parasprite"
EQS_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially a Muletilda replacement, the Rainbow's development was massively delayed due to its design being 'appropriated and adjusted' for the Timberwolf, a temporary Twilight stand-in. When the lighter Rainbow design was finally ready, it was arguably already obsolete, as Equestria struggled to repel the seemingly endless tide of well armoured Changeling Panzers."

EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Cragadile"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experience with the Muletilda quickly demonstrated that tanks with greater protection and firepower were needed. Work on a new design, the Twilight, began, but progressed so slowly that a stopgap was required. The result was the Timberwolf, a modification of the incomplete Rainbow project, with a new engine, more armor, redesigned turret, and larger main gun added. The Timberwolf was the first Equestrian tank to combine adequate speed, respectable armour, and significant firepower."
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Cragadile"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Timberwolf"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The story of the Twilight is the story of the Equestrian war in microcosm. An ambitious magitek design proposed at the onset of the Great War, its development began in an era of administrative chaos and was badly delayed. Ambition met reality, and the magitek elements were abandoned due to a lack of required specialist unicorn mechanics. When the Twilight finally began production, Equestria was a new, reformed military machine, and it symbolised the awakening of Equestrian military power."

EQS_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Manticore"
EQS_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "With new expertise from the Stalliongrad tech sharing project the Comet revisited the ambitious goals of the Twilight, but with a more realistic approach. More refined in its systems, it utilized the very best of Equestrian technology. Arriving in time to lead the drive into the heart of the Changeling Lands, Comet tanks became a symbol of Equestrian liberation and victory, as they rolled through formerly occupied towns of cheering deer and sullen, defeated, hives."

EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Bugbear"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "While Equestrian tank development focused on light and cost-efficient designs due to the limited resources of the military, an ambitious project for a much larger tank was drawn up in the years leading up to the Great War. Named the Bugbear, it carried armor believed to be impenetrable at the time and a larger gun with side turrets at the expense of being prohibitively expensive and slow. Though a few were created as prototypes and passed inspection, none saw active combat."
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Bugbear"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Cerberus"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Experience with heavy combat demonstrated a need for larger, better armoured, tanks, with powerful main guns, to counter enemy tanks and entrenched defenses, and act as the spearhead for breakthrough forces. The Celestia was designed in response to those requirements, and, while it suffered from mechanical issues due to its weight and the failure of hoped-for magitek engine and transmission system components to be manufacturable on an adequate scale, it was judged to be generally effective in those roles."
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Cerberus"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Ursa Minor"
EQS_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially conceived to support a spearhead by the (ultimately shelved) Ursa Major, the (now ironically named) Ursa Minor refined the Celestia's design. Longer, with a new turret, and larger main gun, its mechanical systems were improved, and the armor somewhat reworked. It was effective as an improved breakthrough tank, but the mechanical issues were not entirely solved and it remained quite slow."

It was ultimately shelved, with only a few prototypes produced, as much needed reinforcements of common sense continued to pour into Equestrian bureaucracy."

For a short time plans were drawn up to convert these civilian vessels for military use as an Equestrian airfleet, but they were quickly scrapped following the Hippogriff showcase of fighters as the future of aerial combat."

EQS_fighter_equipment_0:0 "Wonderbolt Stinger"
EQS_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "Following the defeat of the Storm King, the Wonderbolts were tasked with making a biplane combat model for the new Royal Equestrian Air Force. The Stinger was their result, a model created from studying Hippogriffian military aircraft and applying it to Equestrian domestic technology. Though the Stinger was arguably obsolete by the time of its release in 1006, it was still produced and saw limited combat in the Great War as Equestria desperately fought to control the skies."

EQS_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Wonderbolt Vapor"
EQS_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "As conflict with the Changeling Queendom seemed ever more certain, the Wonderbolt Design Bureau began work on their first monoplane model, the Vapor. With a stronger frame and engine capable of reaching speeds only the most talented pegasi could hope to match, it performed admirably in the Great War despite its reduced agility and lackluster production numbers due to disagreements between the Wonderbolts and the Royal Guard on funding."

EQS_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Wonderbolt Whiplash"
EQS_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "With casualities mounting and under pressure to close the technological gap with the Changeling Luftwaffe, the Whiplash was developed as the war seemed to continue moving against Equestria. Improving on the design of the Vapor in almost every aspect, particularly in armaments, it was the most produced Equestrian aircraft in the Great War due to its general performance and popularity among pilots and played an instrumental role in countless air battles."

EQS_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Wonderbolt Spitfire"
EQS_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Spitfire was the final word in traditional fighter design, being produced as the signature Equestrian aircraft in the late stages of the Great War as the conflict turned decisively against the Changeling Queendom. With no equal in the sky at the times of its creation, the Spitfire secured aerial dominance over both Equestria and the changeling homeland, and was used and studied internationally long after standard turboprop engine designs were made obsolete."

EQS_CAS_equipment_1:0 "Stratusburg Wildfire"
EQS_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Given the long history of pegasi working in tandem with ground forces, designs for a battlefield support aircraft were quickly drawn up and assigned to the Stratusburg branch of the Wonderbolt Design Bureau. The Wildfire did prove effective in the few instances where it was deployed in the Great War, but was not produced in large numbers due to early changeling dominance in the skies rendering close air support infeasible."
