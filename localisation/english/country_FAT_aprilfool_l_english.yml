 chaos.1.title:0 "The Sin of Weakness" #sweet
 chaos.1.desc:0 "For decades, these supposed 'revolutionaries' had cowered up here in the north, setting up their little fiefdoms and playing at democracy. It disgusted him, knowing that these bleating sheep may well try to oppose him, even as they long since had lost the right to it. Merely the idea of them remaining made bile spill up in his throat, and giving the order was the easiest thing he could ever had done. More than that, it was exhilarating, like something was put right.\n\nAs his Void Knights moved out into the city, kicking down the doors of any of those who had had a leading role in the the old government. Further outside Cloudbury, other groups of knights were striking in all other cities as well. They, their families, their friends and everycreature who were close to them, all rounded up and sent to the stockyards outside Cloudbury.\n\nWith the chaos and starvation that had raged across the north, their failure was clear. Decades had passed, and they had nothing to show fore it. They were worse than useless, parasites on what was now his realm, and he was their judge." 
 chaos.1.a:0 "And yet, they may still be part of the solution."

 chaos.2.title:0 "A Mysterious Bounty" #sweet
 chaos.2.desc:0 "Dawnclaw grabbed the leg of meat in front of him, tearing into it with pleasure. His generals - lining the sides of the great table in front of him, enjoyed their feast as well. All of them except one, and Dawnclaw paid close notice to the figure far down the left side of the table as they stared at the plate in front of them where a bounty of meat awaited.\n\n"Getting a little fussy are we?" he drawled as he stared him down. "The famine is abating, and we're feasting to celebrate that nogriff goes hungry. What's wrong?" An entire table filled with void knights, traitor generals and bandits who had flocked to his side all turned to stare him down. Rising from his seat, Dawnclaw lumbered over to him and leaned in over him. "Are you not enjoying the feast I provided for you?" he asked, his transformation and the armor he wore both making him tower above Rosewing. Rosewing sat silent, staring down at the plate.\n\n"Come on Claus," another voice chimed in from the other side of the table as Reinhart Suntail leaned forward. "In a few weeks Dawnclaw did more than Kemerskai could do in decades. And besides we're committed already. For once in your life suck it up and enjoy the spoils of our triumph." Suntail was a good one. He had fallen in line eagerly, and Dawnclaw could tell there was nothing he wouldn't do if it would give him victory. Rosewing, however, was trapped in delusions still. Would he have to die? Thankfully, he wouldn't, as he grabbed the hunk of meat and tore into it aggressively, eating in silence as Dawnclaw grinned. Stepping back to his seat, Dawnclaw grabbed his wine glass and raised it high to toast them."
