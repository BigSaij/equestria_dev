newjaks.5.d:0 "#TODO: Star Mountain beats the crap out of a yak in a duel, and is only talked out of killing him by a close friend. Should be showing her immense brutality."

newjaks.6.t:0 "Unstoppable Force"
newjaks.6.d:0 "#TODO: Kerr decides that he's going to put aside his political biases for the moment, and really join the team. He wants to reign, but he can't do that if Rutherford's coalition wins."
newjaks.6.a:0 "We will triumph!"

newjaks.7.t:0 "An Opportunity"
newjaks.7.d:0 "REPORT ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN YAKYAKISTAN:\n\nIn spite of the many difficulties VOPS agents encounter while impersonating yaks, we have successfully embedded infiltrators across the country in intelligence gathering roles.\n\nReports from Yakistown are not encouraging. Prince Rutherford is developing a nearly unshakable devotion to Equestria, largely due to his relationship with the element bearer Pinkie Pie. The Jaki secession crisis has recently forced Rutherford to align himself with Yakyakistan's small but growing communist movement, which is firmly under Stalliongradian influence. Chances of pushing the central government towards a pro-Changeling stance are minimal.\n\nHowever, the situation in Saihan Tolgod presents many opportunities. Prince Bradford, Rutherford's estranged brother, is rallying the yak clans to fight against all foreign influence. Though the Jaki Clan forms the core of his movement, he is now gaining support across the country. His victory would destroy Equestrian influence in Yakyakistan and ensure its neutrality in any future conflict.\n\nEven more promising is the Yürkid Clan. At the behest of their leader, Kerr, they have now joined forces with the Jaki. Our agents describe Kerr as a fanatical expansionist, but his goals are not entirely incompatible with our own. Having convinced Bradford that we can be trusted, he is now reported to be seeking Changeling military support for their cause.\n\nField agents advise strongly considering this request."
newjaks.7.a:0 "Another Equestrian pawn shall fall."
newjaks.7.b:0 "The yaks aren't worth the effort."

newjaks.8.t:0 "Changeling Advisors Arrive"
newjaks.8.d:0 "Prince Bradford shivered slightly as the Queen's Guard officer approached. With his chitin and the dark uniform he contrasted harshly against the snowy ground. Kerr, standing beside the Prince, was smiling ear to ear.\n\n"Yaks grateful for changeling help," Prince Bradford said shakily, "But Jaki-Clan and allies want to stop all foreign meddling, not just by ponies. Prince ask that changelings focus on war only."\n\n"Don't worry Your Majesty," the changeling replied in a raspy voice, "Our orders are to help train and equip your army, and we have ways of keeping our activities discreet."\n\n"Yes, very good!" Kerr interjected, "Bugs bring weapons, yes? Yak want to see new weapons!"\n\nAs Kerr and the officer walked away Bradford tried to reassure himself. With his brother getting aid from the ponies to the south he had no choice but to bring in the changelings. Surely they'd be willing to leave after he emerged victorious..."
newjaks.8.a:0 "Who says changelings can't be trusted?"

newjaks.9.t:0 "The Changelings Refuse"
newjaks.9.d:0 "After Kerr informed changeling agents that Prince Bradford wanted military aid the two yaks waited for a reply. Days went by, then weeks, then months. Eventually they realized the lack of a response meant the answer was "no."\n\n"Prince knew bugs cannot be trusted." Bradford said with a sneer, "Jaki and Yürkid clans must reclaim Yakyakistan alone!"\n\nWhen Kerr finally realized the changelings weren't coming he was furious. Only after thrashing and smashing for hours was he able to calm down. He thought the bugs were proud warriors, but they appeared to be just as cowardly as their pony enemies."
newjaks.9.a:0 "Bugs will get theirs eventually..."

newjaks.10.t:0 "Pony Special Help"

He says in no uncertain terms that the only way they're going to meet again is if Bradford returns the crown and ends his isolationism and harshness towards the harmonists and communists.

newjaks.24.d:0 "#TODO: Kerr offers Yngvar a commission in the army, with his old rank, if he swears fealty to the new Khan and will serve the army with honor.

JAK_chrysalis_is_a_commie:0 "Chrysalis the Communist"
JAK_chrysalis_is_a_commie_desc:0 "Chrysalis has long been known as an enemy of harmony, but we have realized that she is in fact a communist as well!

JAK_the_heir_of_amore:0 "The Heir of Amore"
JAK_the_heir_of_amore_desc:0 "Princess Amore, ancient ruler of the Crystal Empire in the days even before Sombra, has always been the true royal line. Both Sombra and Cadence were usurpers. Star Mountain has, after extensive research into her own family tree, discovered that she is in fact related to Amore! Therefore, the Crystal Empire is hers by right."

JAK_the_equestrian_khaganate_desc:0 "It is done. Equestria has been liberated, and harmony has triumphed. Now the time has come to reorganize our government. No more merely Severyanian, now we are Equestrian! And Star Mountain has proven herself a true paragon of harmony. Isn't it only right she should become Princess of all Equestria?"
JAK_the_queen_of_the_bugs:0 "The Queen of the Bugs"
JAK_the_queen_of_the_bugs_desc:0 "With the changelings defeated, we are now at a crossroads on how to govern this vast land. The methods used in Severyana are likely not to be productive here, as changelings are naturally very skilled partisans. Moreover, communism has not yet fully sunk its vile tendrils into Changeling culture. Therefore, rather than decimation, we will show mercy. The old caste system will be restored under Star Mountain."

JAK_sm_advisor_1:0 "Dasha Solepyeraya"
JAK_sm_advisor_1_desc:0 "Dasha Solepyeraya is a name that evokes terror and fury in Ravenskoye. Noted for her cruelty and harshness against her serfs forced to labor in the salt mines, and for her near-monopoly on salt production in Severyana, her large, ancient dynasty was nearly completely toppled in the Winter Revolution. Many of her relatives faced decades in prison, while others were shot for their exploitation of the poor. She and her husband tried to fly to Trottingham, but her husband was shot down and drowned in the Celestial Sea. She only barely escaped.\n\nNow, she has joined Star Mountain's rightful crusade against the communists. She has a special hatred for pegasi who can fly better than she can, inflicting awful tortures upon them. She longs to return home to Ravenskoye to avenge her husband and retake her rightful holdings."
JAK_sm_advisor_2:0 "Magnit Moonsong"
JAK_sm_advisor_2_desc:0 "A batpony from a relatively young line, Magnit Moonsong hails from Severoholm. His family are fanatical star worshippers, especially interested in the stars near the moon. His ancestors opened several profitable mines near the city and became boyars, until the Winter Revolution took everything from them. He has always been interested in magical beasts, and the influence of stars on them as well. He is determined to discover the truth behind these mysteries, no matter the cost. The stars are right to retake Severyana, and punish the ungrateful communists who have ruined his research and mines!"
JAK_sm_advisor_3:0 "Pepel Stremennoy"
JAK_sm_advisor_3_desc:0 "The younger brother of the firstborn daughter, Pepel's family were a major transportation manufacturer. He fought with the anti-revolutionaries from the very beginning, estranged from his socialist sister, and when Celestia told the Royal Guards to stand down, he realized she was a fool. There can be no negotiation with the communist scum. The time has come to retake Severyana, and pay back the upstart serfs--with interest."

JAK_not_a_jak:0 "Abram the Editorgoat"
JAK_not_a_jak_desc:0 "The rebellious government of the Jaki-Clan rules over a largely illiterate populace, yet in the cities, many yaks read foreign newspapers and books. They often contain ideas that go against the yak Way of Life, and as such censorship is required. A strange creature offered to help Jaki-Clan with their task of cleaning up texts from abroad: Abram the goat. He offered to simply eat all paper which contained offensive or misguided text. The yaks, lacking the technology of paper shredders, happily accepted Abram's offer. It is a symbiotic relationship: Abram gets to eat all the paper he wants, while the Jaki-Clan gets to control what its subjects read. Noyak knows how a goat even got into Yakyakistan, but Abram is seen as a trustworthy honorary yak, so his backstory does not matter."

A Severyanian exile, she hates communism more than anyyak around and longs to see Stalliongrad liberated. While her sanity is questionable, her effectiveness is not."

JAK_garrin_korai:0 "Garrin"
JAK_GARRIN_DESC:0 "Garrin, the fiery leader of the Ubkhait clan army is quite different than her clan's cold tradition. She is easily angered and never forgets a slight--perhaps the reason she led her clan to the Jakichikh an old grudge with Rutherford. It's rumored that this grudge dates back to Rutherford spurning her affection, but she refuses to discuss such matters. Still, she is very experienced at holding the line, and the Shield of the East will not be broken easily."

JAK_MAIHOV_DESC:0 "Maihov is the leader of the Jakichikh, or at least used to be. He adopted Bradford as a brother and then abdicated, for reasons still debated.

She used to have hopes. Now there's only snow, mountains, and forests. She wants to go home so, so badly. But Chrysalis, in her vast wisdom, wants the yaks as allies, and that means no return for Lucinidea."

POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of March, 971 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: To the east of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan', a shortened version of their full name--the 'Jakichikh Clan Confederation'. A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position. Not to mention his fears of being undermined by his own so-called allies...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_STAR_MOUNTAIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 979 in Zvezdopadovo.\n\n§YBiography§!: Star Mountain, born Burushka Zvezdopadovskaya, is a true anomaly in Yakyakistan. A Severyanian noble, her parents and older sister Sveta were lynched in the Winter Revolution, leaving only her and her beloved brother Seva alive. The two of them, then teenagers, had to beg on their knees to be spared, and even then they were ordered to leave forever, eventually winding up in eastern Yakyakistan. Disease struck Seva the next year, and the primitive yak medicine was unable to save him.\n\nWhen the Jakichikh seceded, Star Mountain sided with them, but not out of ideological reasons. She knows that harmony is necessary to keep different classes and races at peace, and that was sorely lacking in both Stalliongrad and Yakyakistan, but she knew her only shot at justice for her family was to bide her time. When Kerr overthrew Bradford, she took her chance. Now that all threats to her rule are out of the way, the new Khatun of Yakyakistan, reincarnation of the great founder Prince Ulysses, stands ready to bring her vision of harmony and order to all the countries of North Equus. And then, spirits willing, to punish Stalliongrad for its crimes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"

Some have called me brutal; they cannot understand as yet that I am not fighting a political party but a sect of murderers of all that is sacred and holy. And they cannot understand that I am not a pony, not anymore, for Burushka died with her brother. Only Star Mountain remains.\n\nI am the baton that hits the disharmonist, the gun that fires upon the insurrection, the axe that strikes down the communist, the inferno that burns out the changeling. I am the hungry ghost of Yakyakistan, the revenant that haunts the North, the shield against republicanism and the sword against revolution.\n\nI pledge my life and my honor to the Holy Severyanian cause, the extermination of the rebels wherever they may hide, for this night and all the nights to come. For my father, my mother, my sister, my brother, I swear by the divine stars that I shall not rest until the blight of communism is excised from this blessed continent."\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
