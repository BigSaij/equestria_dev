newjaks.7.t:0 "An Opportunity"
newjaks.7.d:0 "REPORT ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN YAKYAKISTAN:\n\nIn spite of the many difficulties VOPS agents encounter while impersonating yaks, we have successfully embedded infiltrators across the country in intelligence gathering roles.\n\nReports from Yakistown are not encouraging. Prince Rutherford is developing a nearly unshakable devotion to Equestria, largely due to his relationship with the element bearer Pinkie Pie. The Jaki secession crisis has recently forced Rutherford to align himself with Yakyakistan's small but growing communist movement, which is firmly under Stalliongradian influence. Chances of pushing the central government towards a pro-Changeling stance are minimal.\n\nHowever, the situation in Saihan Tolgod presents many opportunities. Prince Bradford, Rutherford's estranged brother, is rallying the yak clans to fight against all foreign influence. Though the Jaki Clan forms the core of his movement, he is now gaining support across the country. His victory would destroy Equestrian influence in Yakyakistan and ensure its neutrality in any future conflict.\n\nEven more promising is the Yürkid Clan. At the behest of their leader, Koletiv, they have now joined forces with the Jaki. Our agents describe Koletiv as a fanatical expansionist, but his goals are not entirely incompatible with our own. Having convinced Bradford that we can be trusted, he is now reported to be seeking Changeling military support for their cause.\n\nField agents advise strongly considering this request."

While the Kingdom itself wasn't declared on this day, the celebration is claimed to be set on the date on which the conflicts between the Jaks and Yaks stopped, as both of these groups began seeing each other as allies and friends, instead of enemies.\n\nDuring the day the inhabitants of the Kingdom spend their time smashing various objects and eating together to show and celebrate unity between everyone in the realm. This day of festivities ended with everyone gathering to the massive fire pits, where illuminated by great flames, elder Yaks and Jaks told stories to the younger generations."

jakistan.2.t:0 "Eviction of Non-Yaks"
jakistan.2.d:0 "While the new monarch of the Yaks and Jaks was heavily against anyone that isn't a yak living inside the realm and seemed to want to cut off his kingdom from the rest of the world, nobody really thought that this would truly lead to anything. But as they found out today, Bradford was ready to act upon this ideas.\n\nAll across the Kingdom of Jakistan the houses and other buildings belonging to non-yaks were stormed by Jak soldiers. Their inhabitants were captured and all of their items were gathered. While many of them managed to avoid capture by running off to the various embassies that are still present within the nation, thousands were still captured by the warriors loyal to the king. Their places of residence were also searched thoroughly for both anyone who could be hiding and to find any objects that are of foreign origin. All such objects were simply smashed, while their previous owners were simply transported to the edges of the kingdom, and with typical Jak lack of tact, simply kicked out beyond the borders."
jakistan.2.a:0 "NON-YAKS MADE US WEAK! THEY DESERVE IT!"

jakistan.3.t:0 "Bradford's Speech"
jakistan.3.d:0 "Bradford stepped out in front of his Yak and Jak subjects who had gathered to listen to his comment about the current position of Kingdom of Jakistan and it's future. The monarch gazed through the thousands if not tens of thousands of his subjects that have gathered to listen to him. He cleared his throat in order to speak loud enough for all of them to hear his words.\n\n"Bradford proud! Kingdom of Jaks and Yaks strong, stronger than Kingdom of just Jaks or Yaks! Jaks and Yaks do good, preserve Yak Way of Life and Yak tradition! Kick out weak non-yaks to preserve kingdom! Now Jak and Yak kingdom can be perfect again! Now Jak and Yak kingdom can prosper!\n\nBradford very proud that Yaks understood that they knew the Yak Way of LIfe wrong and want to understand it right. Bradford proud that Jaks for helping Yaks understand and forgiving them for wrongdoing! Elders say that if Yaks and Jaks continue being as one and being strong, Yak Way of Life will survive in remain strong forever!""

POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of March, 971 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: To the east of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan', after their leading clan the Jakichikh. A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position. Not to mention his fears of being undermined by his own so-called allies...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_STAR_MOUNTAIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 979 in Zvezdopadovo.\n\n§YBiography§!: Star Mountain, born Burushka Zvezdopadovsky, is a true anomaly in Yakyakistan. A Severyanian noble, her parents and adult sister were lynched in the Winter Revolution, leaving only her and her beloved brother alive. The two of them, then teenagers, had to beg on their knees to be spared, and even then they were ordered to leave forever, eventually winding up in eastern Yakyakistan. Disease struck her brother the next year, and the primitive yak medicine was unable to save him.\n\nWhen the Jakichikh seceded, Star Mountain sided with them, but not out of ideological reasons. She knows that harmony is necessary to keep different classes and races at peace, and that was sorely lacking in both Stalliongrad and Yakyakistan, but she knew her only shot at justice for her family was to bide her time. When Koletiv overthrew Bradford, she took her chance. Now that all threats to her rule are out of the way, the new Khatun of Yakyakistan, reincarnation of the great founder Prince Ulysses, stands ready to bring her vision of harmony and order to all the countries of North Equus. And then, spirits willing, to punish Stalliongrad for its crimes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
