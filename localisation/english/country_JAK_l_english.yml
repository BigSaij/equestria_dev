### Events ###
jakistan.1.t:0 "The Day of Unity"
jakistan.1.d:0 "Millions of Yaks and Jaks have gathered in the towns of Jakistan, coming from all corners of the realm to celebrate it's establishment, the continuous survival of Yak and Jak traditions, and of course the Yak Way of Life. While the Kingdom itself wasn't declared on this day, the celebration is claimed to be set on the date on which the conflicts between the Jaks and Yaks stopped, as both of these groups began seeing each other as allies and friends, instead of enemies.\n\nDuring the day the inhabitants of the Kingdom spend their time smashing various objects and eating together to show and celebrate unity between everyone in the realm. This day of festivities ended with everyone gathering to the massive fire pits, where illuminated by great flames, elder Yaks and Jaks told stories to the younger generations."
jakistan.1.a:0 "JAK AND YAK UNITY STRONG!"

jakistan.2.t:0 "Eviction of Non-Yaks"
jakistan.2.d:0 "While the new monarch of the Yaks and Jaks was heavily against anyone that isn't a yak living inside the realm and seemed to want to cut off his kingdom from the rest of the world, nobody really thought that this would truly lead to anything. But as they found out today, Bradford was ready to act upon this ideas.\n\nAll across the Kingdom of Jakistan the houses and other buildings belonging to non-yaks were stormed by Jak soldiers. Their inhabitants were captured and all of their items were gathered. While many of them managed to avoid capture by running off to the various embassies that are still present within the nation, thousands were still captured by the warriors loyal to the king. Their places of residence were also searched thoroughly for both anyone who could be hiding and to find any objects that are of foreign origin. All such objects were simply smashed, while their previous owners were simply transported to the edges of the kingdom, and with typical Jak lack of tact, simply kicked out beyond the borders."
jakistan.2.a:0 "NON-YAKS MADE US WEAK! THEY DESERVE IT!"

jakistan.3.t:0 "Bradford's Speech"
jakistan.3.d:0 "Bradford stepped out in front of his Yak and Jak subjects who had gathered to listen to his comment about the current position of Kingdom of Jakistan and it's future. The monarch gazed through the thousands if not tens of thousands of his subjects that have gathered to listen to him. He cleared his throat in order to speak loud enough for all of them to hear his words.\n\n"Bradford proud! Kingdom of Jaks and Yaks strong, stronger than Kingdom of just Jaks or Yaks! Jaks and Yaks do good, preserve Yak Way of Life and Yak tradition! Kick out weak non-yaks to preserve kingdom! Now Jak and Yak kingdom can be perfect again! Now Jak and Yak kingdom can prosper!\n\nBradford very proud that Yaks understood that they knew the Yak Way of LIfe wrong and want to understand it right. Bradford proud that Jaks for helping Yaks understand and forgiving them for wrongdoing! Elders say that if Yaks and Jaks continue being as one and being strong, Yak Way of Life will survive in remain strong forever!""
jakistan.3.a:0 "JAK WAY OF LIFE WILL SURVIVE FOREVER!"
