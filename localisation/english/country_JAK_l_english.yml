jakistan.1.d:0 "Millions of Yaks and Jaks have gathered in the towns of Jakistan, coming from all corners of the realm to celebrate it's establishment, the continuous survival of Yak and Jak traditions, and of course the Yak Way of Life. While the Kingdom itself wasn't declared on this day, the celebration is claimed to be set on the date on which the conflicts between the Jaks and Yaks stopped, as both of these groups began seeing each other as allies and friends, instead of enemies.\n\nDuring the day the inhabitants of the Kingdom spend their time smashing various objects and eating together to show and celebrate unity between everyone in the realm. This day of festivities ended with everyone gathering to the massive fire pits, where illuminated by great flames, elder Yaks and Jaks told stories to the younger generations."
jakistan.1.a:0 "JAK AND YAK UNITY STRONG!"

jakistan.2.t:0 "Eviction of Non-Yaks"
jakistan.2.d:0 "While the new monarch of the Yaks and Jaks was heavily against anyone that isn't a yak living inside the realm and seemed to want to cut off his kingdom from the rest of the world, nobody really thought that this would truly lead to anything. But as they found out today, Bradford was ready to act upon this ideas.\n\nAll across the Kingdom of Jakistan the houses and other buildings belonging to non-yaks were stormed by Jak soldiers. Their inhabitants were captured and all of their items were gathered. While many of them managed to avoid capture by running off to the various embassies that are still present within the nation, thousands were still captured by the warriors loyal to the king. Their places of residence were also searched thoroughly for both anyone who could be hiding and to find any objects that are of foreign origin. All such objects were simply smashed, while their previous owners were simply transported to the edges of the kingdom, and with typical Jak lack of tact, simply kicked out beyond the borders."
jakistan.2.a:0 "NON-YAKS MADE US WEAK! THEY DESERVE IT!"

jakistan.3.t:0 "Bradford's Speech"
jakistan.3.d:0 "Bradford stepped out in front of his Yak and Jak subjects who had gathered to listen to his comment about the current position of Kingdom of Jakistan and it's future. The monarch gazed through the thousands if not tens of thousands of his subjects that have gathered to listen to him. He cleared his throat in order to speak loud enough for all of them to hear his words.\n\n"Bradford proud! Kingdom of Jaks and Yaks strong, stronger than Kingdom of just Jaks or Yaks! Jaks and Yaks do good, preserve Yak Way of Life and Yak tradition! Kick out weak non-yaks to preserve kingdom! Now Jak and Yak kingdom can be perfect again! Now Jak and Yak kingdom can prosper!\n\nBradford very proud that Yaks understood that they knew the Yak Way of LIfe wrong and want to understand it right. Bradford proud that Jaks for helping Yaks understand and forgiving them for wrongdoing! Elders say that if Yaks and Jaks continue being as one and being strong, Yak Way of Life will survive in remain strong forever!""

JAK_crazy_pony_exiles_desc:0 "Small band of ponies flee Severyana when revolution happen and settle in Yakyakistan. Leader of ponies, Star Mountain, is big strong honorary yak and very good at SMASHing. Now war looming, maybe she will help save Yakyakistan from communism so it not become part of Stalliongrad too?"
JAK_emigre_connections_guy:0 "Severyanian Exile Economic Help"
JAK_emigre_connections_guy_desc:0 "Strange good news! Some Severyanian nobles want help us because Stalliongrad helps Rutherford. One pony even want serve in our government to stop communism! It very strange, but maybe is good idea."
JAK_formally_denounce_stalliongrad:0 "Say Stalliongrad Bad"
JAK_formally_denounce_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Star Mountain told Bradford about horrors of communism. Stalliongradians murder all who not like communism, including children. Everyone starves and is miserable except party leaders who are even richer than old tsars. Clearly Stalliongrad is awful in every way! Even if we not go to war, we hope someone does and overthrows terrible communists."
JAK_special_pony_magic_trick:0 "Special Pony Magic Trick"

JAK_reach_out_to_bugs:0 "Get Bug Help"
JAK_reach_out_to_bugs_desc:0 "Koletiv told Bradford crazy proposal: get changeling help in war. Bradford almost have Koletiv exiled for treason on spot, but Koletiv calm him down. Changelings know lots of war tricks, and Rutherford gets help from Equestria. Maybe this worth it?"

JAK_convince_the_central_clans:0 "Convince Central Clans"

JAK_khoriikhat_branch:0 "Mandate of Origin"
JAK_khoriikhat_branch_desc:0 "The Khoriikhat hold claim to the birthplace of Yakkind, as well as a true lineage to the Eastern Yak Khaganate, the largest Yak clan confederacy to have ever existed. This grants them the legitimacy of seniority providing their liege with the ultimate claim to the mandate of Yak rule."
JAK_younger_brother:0 "The Younger Brother"
JAK_younger_brother_desc:0 "Clan Khoriikhat's succession has been under debate for almost half a decade. With their ill father on his deathbed, incapable of making any decisions, the two rival siblings of Khoriikhat gather support to become the future ruler of the clan. NAME HERE, the younger sibling, but the legitimate heir by clan law, is both reckless and short-tempered (even for a Yak). He may be the key to controlling the might of the Khoriikhat clan if we support him and direct his anger on our enemies."
JAK_older_sister:0 "The Older Sister"
JAK_older_sister_desc:0 "Clan Khoriikhat's succession has been under debate for almost half a decade. With their ill father on his deathbed, incapable of making any decisions, the two rival siblings of Khoriikhat gather support to become the future ruler of the clan. NAME HERE, the daughter of the Prince of Khoriikhat, second in line according to clan law, yet more popular with clan elders than her brother. She would seem the ideal choice for the next ruler of the Khoriikhat clan, if not for her patient and cunning nature, as well as the unique yet archaic laws of the Khoriikhat clan."
JAK_noyamanan_branch:0 "Weaponise the Literate"
JAK_noyamanan_branch_desc:0 "The Noyamanan clan has the highest literacy rate among the Yaks by a significant margin, the power this imbues in them could potentially turn the tide of war against our enemy. Though our oral history is great, it is widely known that stories have been twisted and bent over the centuries as times have changed. This is not the case with the ancient scriptures in the possession of the Noyamanan. They've been preserved as they were when the Yak script was first invented and could be a potent tool for spreading our agenda."
JAK_hidden_languages:0 "Hidden Languages"
JAK_hidden_languages_desc:0 "Language can be used for many purposes. The Noyamanan clan's mastery of the written language has allowed them to play around with it for many generations, creating strange forms that to an outside would seem like the writings of a madyak, but in actuality has hidden meaning only known to its writer and intended receiver: codes. We will make use of this ability to gain an intel advantage over our enemy."
JAK_words_on_the_wind:0 "Words on the Wind"
JAK_words_on_the_wind_desc:0 "Communication of orders has long relied on the possession of the gift of the Yak script. With our allies in the Noyamanan clan we can ensure that orders on every front will be received in the exact same form they were given, granting us a cutting edge that will wither away all pitiful efforts our enemies will make."
JAK_juyilkhai_branch:0 "A Choice"
JAK_juyilkhai_branch_desc:0 "Though the far northern reaches of the Juyilkhai inhabit frequently drop below freezing temperatures, it is not the environment which chills one to the bone. Walking the valleys and mountains is like traversing a labyrinthine network of old portraits; you always feel watched. What boon could this horrible and cold land possibly grant our nation?"
JAK_a_flower:0 "A Flower"
JAK_a_flower_desc:0 "The Khöldöökh flower of Juyilkhai's wastes... What could it mean?"
JAK_a_skull:0 "A Skull"
JAK_a_skull_desc:0 "Macabre as it is, there isn't much interpretation here... Is there?"
JAK_ubkhait_branch:0 "The Shield of Yakyakistan"
JAK_ubkhait_branch_desc:0 "The Ubkhait clan held strong against vastly superior forces against the Griffons in the east. Before the secession and before Rutherford, they swore an oath to support our clan. Perhaps the greatest engineers of fortifications in all of Yakyakistan reside with the Ubkhait clan: how could we not use them?"
JAK_ubkhaits_front:0 "Ubkhaits in the Forts"
JAK_ubkhaits_front_desc:0 "Ubkhaits will bunker down and establish an unbreakable wall, impervious to any assault!."
JAK_ubkhaits_command:0 "Ubkhait High Command"
JAK_ubkhaits_command_desc:0 "Their expertise is better used in the high command, rather than wasted in the ditches."
JAK_kiyatukh_branch:0 "Unified in Faith"
JAK_kiyatukh_branch_desc:0 "Shorooniism, the majority faith of all Yaks, serves to bring the population of our fair land closer together, despite all differences. With war now upon us, unifying ideals have become more relevant than ever. The Kiyatukh clan's religious leadership can be a useful tool, as the power of the 15th incarnation of the Tsagaan Khutughtu still holds real power over a great number of Yaks, even beyond our frontlines."
JAK_fabricate_prophecies:0 "Fabricate Prophecies"
JAK_fabricate_prophecies_desc:0 "Most Yaks don't know how to read, perhaps they wouldn't notice a change here or there that just so happens to be in our favour"
JAK_share_our_legends:0 "Proselytise Our Legends"
JAK_share_our_legends_desc:0 "Cheating and lying are the weapons of the enemy! We must stick true to the old legends. Let us spread the great legends of the Kiyatukh clan and prove that we are truly righteous."
JAK_mankhutayid_branch:0 "SMASH their Machines!"
JAK_mankhutayid_branch_desc:0 "The Mankhutayid clan, above all else, values the sanctity of the artisan's work. This has in recent times led to their hatred of modernisation, but more specifically the industrialisation it brings. Machines that churn out product starving the humble artisan of opportunity. Perhaps unleashing these machine-smashing luddites upon our enemies wouldn't be a bad idea."
JAK_great_smashing_campaign:0 "Great SMASHing Campaign"
JAK_great_smashing_campaign_desc:0 "Having tasted vengeance against their enemy: the machine, the Mankhutayid extremists are now longing for a great crusade deep behind the enemy lines. It seems their hatred knows no bounds and it may be prudent to halt them while we're able."
JAK_deity_of_smashing:0 "Deity of SMASHing"
JAK_deity_of_smashing_desc:0 "The idea of sainthood as it exists in Griffonia is foreign to the Yaks. However, there do exist several minor deities who account for various phenomena who are worshipped as part of local rituals and ceremonies. Recently, within the Mankhutayid clan, a deity has emerged named Khüirekh. The god of smashing, but not just smashing (as that's more than fulfilled by the two brothers Yak and Jak), the smashing of inorganic machinery and technology deemed too "modern". A slightly dangerous if situationally useful cult, we should attempt to shape them into something that could assist us in the current war."
JAK_khataut_branch:0 "War of Proving"
JAK_khataut_branch_desc:0 "The last war fought by the Khata'ut was the disastrous struggle against the Griffons in the east. Shame hangs over their clan's emblem like death over a sickly yak. For this reason they've focused all of their effort on proving their worth in the current war against the so-called kingdom, seeking to regain their former glory. They want to bring a final end to this war through whatever means they must."
JAK_far_from_the_front:0 "Far from the Front"
JAK_far_from_the_front_desc:0 "The Khata'ut clan has the luxury of being far behind the Jakichikh front lines, which almost ensures that they won't see combat in their clan lands unless something goes horribly wrong. To make up for this, they're promising to supply our troops with everything they can afford."
JAK_the_dishonored:0 "The Dishonoured"
JAK_the_dishonored_desc:0 "A significant portion of Yaks, previously part of the clan banner of Khata'ut, seeks to prove themselves now that they finally have a war to fight. They are, however, quite old at this point with them all being retired soldiers."


JAK_end_of_civil_war:0 "End of Civil War"

POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "To the East of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan.' A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position."
POLITICS_STAR_MOUNTAIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of Dcember, 979 in Princessyn (now Stalliongrad).\n\n§YBiography§!: Star Mountain, born Burushka Zvezdopadovsky, is a true anomaly in Yakyakistan. A Severyanian noble, her parents and adult sister were lynched in the Winter Revolution, leaving only her and her beloved brother alive. The two of them, then teenagers, had to beg on their knees to be spared, and even then they were ordered to leave forever, eventually winding up in eastern Yakyakistan. Disease struck her brother the next year, and the primitive yak medicine was unable to save him.\n\nWhen the Jakichikh seceded, Star Mountain sided with them, but not out of ideological reasons. She knows that harmony is necessary to keep different classes and races at peace, and that was sorely lacking in both Stalliongrad and Yakyakistan, but she knew her only shot at justice for her family was to bide her time. When Koletiv overthrew Bradford, she took her chance. Now that all threats to her rule are out of the way, the new Khatun of Yakyakistan, reincarnation of the great founder Prince Ulysses, stands ready to bring her vision of harmony and order to all the countries of North Equus. And then, spirits willing, to punish Stalliongrad for its crimes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: TBA"
