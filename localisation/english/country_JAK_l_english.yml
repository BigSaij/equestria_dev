newjaks.1.t:0 "Dreams to be Buried In"
newjaks.1.d:0 "There was snow and dreams to be buried in, yaks' snow and dreams. Half-buried in a wrathful blizzard, Prince Bradford withstood the elements to commemorate yet another batch of soldiers having passed military training under conditions most other creatures in Equus would die from. Medals, horns, and hearty meals awaited them within the lonely yurt, but that would come after this tradition of blessing them in the freezing wind.\n\nTradition and dreams—Rutherford was doing his best to crush them all. Bradford didn't need to visit the other clan anymore to see the continuing degeneracy that festered there. The ponies offering free aid to an acquiescing yak, in the midst of an avalanche no less, was deplorable, a decision made so hastily. Short-term success, and for what? An endless stream of licking Celestia's horseshoes, abandoning the stalwart path of the yaks for serene submission.\n\nPonies wearing yak skins and fur. Disgust boiled within every inch of Bradford's being. Still, he did his best not to show it before these young recruits, many of whom had left Rutherford's realm for a society that millennia of bloodlines and lineages had always sworn by. The last thing they needed from Bradford was a smash of untimely anger, a sheer lack of discipline after gruelling months of nothing but."

newjaks.3.t:0 "Snowball"
newjaks.3.d:0 "Wherever the border between the two yak nations wasn't exactly vague, wherever allegedly impenetrable fences and barriers were put up to loudly declare, "This is yak territory, not not-yak territory," the yaks posted there could only stay and wait, remaining ever vigilant over a naked strip of snow.\n\n"It's time! What do fake yaks have?" one yak from the Jaki-Clan yelled from out of the wintry blue. "Nothing! All fake yaks want pony to step on yaks forever!"\n\n"Hey, yaks can hear sad yaks!" a shout carried from across the rift. "Prince see better way than just pure yak way!"\n\nA snowball would fly across the border. It fell pathetically into no-yak's-land. "Who is yak, yak that don't know own history?!"\n\n"Yak history is trap! Rutherford wants way out! Yak future is different than yak past!" Another snowball then flew back, dropping back into the ground.\n\n"Yak future? More like pretty pony princess future! Not yak future! Yak future will become pony future!"\n\nThe pelting of failed snowballs then persisted until officials on each side reined them in. Real fighting would come another day. Now, the watchtowers and the outposts couldn't dare move, and so couldn't their strangers on the other side of nothing but cold.\n\nAn errant snowball shot into the air, flamed into an explosion, then all headed for their guns."
newjaks.3.a:0 "These strangers, the ones that wear our wool and our faces..."

newjaks.4.t:0 "Heroes?"
newjaks.4.d:0 "At a carved statue of wood, radiating fine finecraftsyakship, Bradford lay. Candles and strange scents had lit his path here to a place of both remembrance and re-orientation, retracing the steps of that ancient yak deified here, his glory found not in being some timeless all-powerful spirit the shamans worshipped but in being... average. When the sea threatened to swallow his world whole, the nameless hero (of decent build and intelligence) applied himself against the elements and stood victorious, saving his village and all civilisation.\n\nAny yak could be him. Any yak like Bradford. Or his brother. They hadn't been scouts nor adventurers in their youth. Under these same skies, they played and danced, constructing a city's worth of snow buildings together only to smash them together. What a riot it all was...\n\nStill, that, too, must be shed. If even Rutherford faltered in the end, who couldn't? The temptation of family above all else, to listen to the ramblings of a blood-relation while putting in jeopardy all yakkind—\n\nIt all made him shake his head, huddling deeper into the shrine."
newjaks.4.a:0 "Gone from my life, gone from my excuses."

newjaks.5.t:0 "The Madmare of Khoriikhat"
newjaks.5.d:0 "#TODO: The land of frost and forest of the north almost set out to prove its namesake every day by letting the snow fall and harsh winds carry it regularly, but to Star Mountain, it provided a comfortable buffer of noise that drowned everything out in it. But today was a rare occurrence where no snow fell, so every step crunched obnoxiously loudly in her ears.\n\nIt was hard to focus on what her friend, Blind Side, was saying as they strolled towards the communal bath house to warm up after a long day of training, because of how frustratingly loud the noise seemed. Then a careless yak standing outside a hut on the side of Star's path spat on the ground and muttered to herself, "Pony carry self like yak, but just pony walks." On any other day, this insult would've gone totally unnoticed, but in the silence of a snowless day, Star Mountain heard it loud and clear.\n\n"You wanna try that again?" Star halted, stomping her hoof into the ground for emphasis. "I don't think I heard you right."\n\n"Yak would be more than happy to," the challenger said, sauntering up to meet Star and leering down at her, which was more than enough for the pony who didn't hesitate to throw a punch under the yak's jaw, which sent them reeling and cast their helmet clean off their head and into the air. \n\nRecoiling for only a moment, Star's challenger brought their head down and rushed forward, hoping to score a direct hit and end the fight with a headbutt. A sense of fury rose from some untapped wellspring of wrath buried within her as she ducked down and caught the underside of the yak's neck with her whole body before proceeding to flip them on their back with a heavy, sickening crunch.\n\nStar Mountain saw red as she took off her sharp, horned helmet and nearly struck it clean through the yak's neck before the words of Blind Side stayed her hooves. "Stop Star! You can't accomplish anything from inside a jail cell! Let it go, you've proven your point!"\n\nShe was right, and Star knew it. She relished in the victory for a moment before taking her turn to spit on the yak and declaring to the crowd of onlookers now forming..."

newjaks.6.d:0 "#TODO: Kerr decides that he's going to put aside his political biases for the moment, and really join the team. He wants to reign, but he can't do that if Rutherford's coalition wins."
newjaks.6.a:0 "We will triumph!"

newjaks.7.t:0 "An Opportunity"
newjaks.7.d:0 "REPORT ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN YAKYAKISTAN:\n\nIn spite of the many difficulties VOPS agents encounter while impersonating yaks, we have successfully embedded infiltrators across the country in intelligence gathering roles.\n\nReports from Yakistown are not encouraging. Prince Rutherford is developing a nearly unshakable devotion to Equestria, largely due to his relationship with the element bearer Pinkie Pie. The Jaki secession crisis has recently forced Rutherford to align himself with Yakyakistan's small but growing communist movement, which is firmly under Stalliongradian influence. Chances of pushing the central government towards a pro-Changeling stance are minimal.\n\nHowever, the situation in Saihan Tolgod presents many opportunities. Prince Bradford, Rutherford's estranged brother, is rallying the yak clans to fight against all foreign influence. Though the Jaki Clan forms the core of his movement, he is now gaining support across the country. His victory would destroy Equestrian influence in Yakyakistan and ensure its neutrality in any future conflict.\n\nEven more promising is the Yürkid Clan. At the behest of their leader, Kerr, they have now joined forces with the Jaki. Our agents describe Kerr as a fanatical expansionist, but his goals are not entirely incompatible with our own. Having convinced Bradford that we can be trusted, he is now reported to be seeking Changeling military support for their cause.\n\nField agents advise strongly considering this request."
newjaks.7.a:0 "Another Equestrian pawn shall fall."
newjaks.7.b:0 "The yaks aren't worth the effort."

newjaks.8.t:0 "Changeling Advisors Arrive"
newjaks.8.d:0 "Prince Bradford shivered slightly as the Queen's Guard officer approached. With his chitin and the dark uniform he contrasted harshly against the snowy ground. Kerr, standing beside the Prince, was smiling ear to ear.\n\n"Yaks grateful for changeling help," Prince Bradford said shakily, "But Jaki-Clan and allies want to stop all foreign meddling, not just by ponies. Prince ask that changelings focus on war only."\n\n"Don't worry Your Majesty," the changeling replied in a raspy voice, "Our orders are to help train and equip your army, and we have ways of keeping our activities discreet."\n\n"Yes, very good!" Kerr interjected, "Bugs bring weapons, yes? Yak want to see new weapons!"\n\nAs Kerr and the officer walked away Bradford tried to reassure himself. With his brother getting aid from the ponies to the south he had no choice but to bring in the changelings. Surely they'd be willing to leave after he emerged victorious..."
newjaks.8.a:0 "Who says changelings can't be trusted?"

newjaks.9.t:0 "The Changelings Refuse"
newjaks.9.d:0 "After Kerr informed changeling agents that Prince Bradford wanted military aid the two yaks waited for a reply. Days went by, then weeks, then months. Eventually they realized the lack of a response meant the answer was "no."\n\n"Prince knew bugs cannot be trusted." Bradford said with a sneer, "Jaki and Yürkid clans must reclaim Yakyakistan alone!"\n\nWhen Kerr finally realized the changelings weren't coming he was furious. Only after thrashing and smashing for hours was he able to calm down. He thought the bugs were proud warriors, but they appeared to be just as cowardly as their pony enemies."

newjaks.19.t:0 "A Most Unexpected Event"
newjaks.19.d:0 "#TODO: The commotion going on in the other room didn't bother Khan Kerr or the isolated Prince Bradford, yaks often got into very noisy fights over very trivial things, and besides, the Khan could always scold his soldiers after he'd made his point to the Prince. Kerr tapped his hoof against the dark table that separated him from his counterpart. "Prince will be provided for, but Prince must provide silence. Khan has no need for vocal enemy, and Khan have no problem making Prince sil—"\n\nThe tense conversation between the two was cut off as the door to the room was kicked clean off its hinges and the hulking pony that had helped to defeat Rutherford entered, and hastily fired at Kerr with a magical rifle. His body hit the ground unceremoniously, fur sizzling from the rounds and cloaking the room in a foul, pungent odor. "What is meaning of this!?" Prince Bradford stumbled backward into the wall, quickly realizing his back was against it.\n\n"The start of true glory for the Khanate." Star Mountain replied coarsely, her eyes sparkling with reverence for herself, "The great Ulysses has returned, and I have given him a new form! As we speak my troops are clearing the path for me to exercise that rule! I suggest that you use their absence here to make your escape into exile like your brother. For your own sake, of course."\n\nPrince Bradford looked on horrified at the smoke coming from Kerr and got the message loud and clear. Star turned and began marching out of the door with a wide grin on her face, "Farewell, Bradford," she called over her shoulder, the smile seeping into her tone, "I've got to join my soldiers and spread the good news that the Khan has fallen, and the Khatun has risen in his place! The best is yet to come!"\n\nFirst the war, then the coup, and now a counter-coup by the madmare Star Mountain herself. Hastily gathering what little things he could carry from his home, Prince Bradford lamented at what would become of his homeland, and if he'd see it collapse from afar."

newjaks.25.t:0 "The Good Old Days"
newjaks.25.d:0 "11/1/996 — Dear diary, I won't forget the look on Papa's face when he stopped me, my brother Seva, and my sister Sveta while we were running through the manor playing tag. For the first time in my life, I saw fear in his eyes. Papa said that Celestia had abandoned Severyana and conceded to the revolutionaries, that we might be kicked out of our family home, and we'd have to say goodbye to the servants. I'm scared, diary, because Papa's scared. I don't want to go, but the reds just might force us out...\n\nIn the brief moments when the sun had begun to rise, but before it fully brought daylight, Star Mountain had some time to herself before she began her day. Since taking control of Yakyakistan, every moment was filled with decisions that had to be made and actions that must be taken, so that precious reprieve became all the more valuable. The old journal from her foalhood in Severyana felt heavy in her hooves as she flipped through the pages. That all too familiar feeling of fire and frenzy welling up within her chest and spreading to every part of her body as though all her nerves stood at attention.\n\n20/1/996 — Dear diary, the worst has come to pass. The servants stormed the manor, and dragged Mama and Papa outside before killing him in front of us. We gave them everything, and this is how they repaid us!? Then those damned reds made us pack our things and when Sveta protested, they… they shot her. Seva and I barely had time to get our belongings, something to remember Papa and Sveta by, before we were dragged to the train station and sent out to Yakyakistan. I don't know what's going to happen to us, diary, but I know that I have to be strong for Seva. He's all I have left.\n\nEvery bit of sadness welling up inside Star Mountain instantly evaporated into rage. Yak spiritualism actually had a term that described her feelings: a 'Hungry Ghost.' An all-consuming feeling that eclipsed all other emotions and replaced them with the most gnawing, burning hunger imaginable. For some it was addiction, others gluttony, for Star Mountain, it was vengeance.\n\n3/3/997 — Dear diary, after weeks of taking care of Seva after he fell ill after arriving here, he took his final breath this morning. His funeral is in a few days. I don't know what to do. I'm all alone.\n\nStalliongrad will pay for what they've done, and revenge will be exacted with the three oldest and strongest weapons of Severyana."
newjaks.25.a:0 "Faith, Autocracy, Harmony."

newjaks.26.t:0 "The Wheel Turns"
newjaks.26.d:0 "The smell of burning straw and wood, the melody of screams and bullets flying, and the sight of it all was as though Star Mountain had stepped out from her wildest dreams and dragged them into the real world before her. The Ghenikhan Clan has been a fifth column within Yakyakistan for decades, ever since their fetid overlord desecrated Severyana and gave the Ghenikhans the hope that they could repeat the destruction here. Now, however, the wheel of history moved forward and crushed the communists beneath its full weight.\n\nThere was no mistake about why Star Mountain, or her mass of cohorts, were here. The soldiers had fallen upon the Clan's lands with all the speed and destruction of a hundred thunderbolts, there was no way to see them coming and no defense could be scrambled. Massacre was too kind of a word to describe the events unfolding around her, as thousands died around her, taking their culture, their history, and most importantly the poison of socialism down with them into their graves. This was an extinction unfolding in real-time.\n\nThe only ones spared were the children of the Ghenikhan Clan, who instead were snatched up and taken prisoners of the new regime, to be placed in the care of other Clans throughout the country so as to wipe their culture from the record completely.\n\nAnd in the center of it all, dancing beneath the thousands of columns of smoke reaching up into the sky, each one their own monument to the fallen, there was Star Mountain dancing and laughing like a filly who just got their cutie mark. Most of her joy came from the nightmare around her, but the rest came from the realization that this was merely the first step on a long road to retribution. That searing wickedness in her was satisfied, but the vicious craving for more burned hotter in her chest. The lands around her would be cleansed in righteous fire, all scorching a path towards home."
newjaks.26.a:0 "The first of many triumphs!"

newjaks.27.t:0 "All One Under the Stars"
newjaks.27.d:0 "There was a particular balcony just outside the throne room in Yakistown that overlooked most of the city on which Star Mountain insisted to speak directly to the people. However, unlike the decrees she, or her top officials, would give under sunlight, the Khatun had decided to give this particular edict under a blanket of stars.\n\nThe residents were ordered to shut off all lights, and factories had to halt production to ensure that no light interfered with the night sky, with the sole exception of two lights above the towering leader of the Khaganate as she stepped out before a cheering mass of yaks, ponies, and a sparse few griffons. All it took was a raise of the hoof and a wave of calm fell upon the crowd.\n\n"I often find myself thinking about destiny," Star Mountain began, her deep, coarse voice booming across the cold and silent city, "What else can explain the long road of hardship that has led me to command this nation, or the fact that I am Ulysses reincarnate. But then, this is only the view looking backward into the past, what I wish to speak about tonight concerns looking forward into the future, and it concerns all of you."\n\nThe vast audience said nothing, the only response came by way of a cold breeze rushing through the crowd as though the land itself wished to speak up, but Star Mountain provided it no such opportunity as she slammed a hoof into the concrete railing before her. "From the time of Ulysses to the present day, these lands have had a shared destiny with our neighbors, who once played a part within that fate before they were wretched from our control." The mare took off her horned helmet and looked up into the countless shimmering stars in the sky joined by the bright ribbons of incandescent northern lights, the crowd readily mirroring her action.\n\n"Every one of you, yak, pony, bear, penguin, and griffon alike is a child of the gods, given a bright, icy soul that was breathed into you by the great Aurora Borealis, and this is what unites all of us into the most glorious future that we will set about creating. Our brethren across the preposterous borders, and every resident in the nation now, will no longer be denied their destiny just as we will no longer deny ours! If you feel as I feel, then you will join me in sealing this fate with the stars and shout! Hurrah!""
newjaks.27.a:0 "And thus, it's all our territory!"

newjaks.28.t:0 "Laying Down Arms"
newjaks.28.d:0 "The city of Yakistown looked a lot different than Baatar remembered, he'd only been a partisan resistance fighter for little over a year, and already so much had changed. New buildings sprouted from the ground like flowers in the first thaw, and yaks and ponies walked side by side seemingly with unending joy across their faces, every bit of it lending validity to the newspaper in his hooves.\n\n'General Amnesty offered to all partisans, report to your local police precinct for details!' Reading it from the harsh mountaintops he and his cohorts hid in to fight back, it seemed too good to be true, but then, so did everything around him. It looked as though the country was taking great strides into the future with every passing day, so maybe turning himself in would be like turning over a new leaf.\n\nBaatar looked up from the paper and held his head high as he moved towards the police building on the corner, swinging inside without the faintest hint of hesitation. The desk in the center of the room was staffed by a rather tired-looking white mare who nearly jumped out of her hide upon seeing a huge yak, with a twin pair of rifles on either side of him. "Oh! I'm sorry, miss, I'm here to turn myself in, I didn't mean to startle you." Bataar instantly unhooked the rifles from his sides one after the other before setting them down before the still apprehensive pony.\n\n"You know, I'll never get used to that." The mare nervously chuckled, parting the red hair from her eyes and sitting back down, gently waving her hoof in the air and calling over another officer, a rather short yak who was still much taller than the pony. "You said you were a partisan, which unit were you with?"\n\n"I was with the 14th Ghenikhan Marksyak Battalion, stationed just outside the ci—" Bataar was cut off harshly.\n\n"Ghenikhans?" The yak officer stepped forward, readying the lone rifle on his right side. "Are you a socialist?"\n\n"Yes, sir, but I want to leave it all behind and start fresh." Bataar couldn't hide the fear in his voice, but as he started for his next sentence, he was cut off by a bullet, then another."
newjaks.28.a:0 "One less red."

newjaks.29.t:0 "A Better Life"
newjaks.29.d:0 "It was like any other day of the week. Clock in, pour the powder into the artillery shells for five hours, break for lunch, only to come back and pour powder for the next five hours. There was a slight reprieve for Khulgana, though, today was the last day in the work week, which meant that the next two days were free from the monotony of the armaments factory and instead filled with the joy of spending the weekend with her three sons.\n\nThere was a festival scheduled for tomorrow, and she'd been saving for months in advance to make it a family trip to remember, the cost would be great, but the priceless smiles on their faces would make every bit of struggle worth it. Khulgana rubbed her eyes with her hooves as she got in line for the paymaster on her way out of the factory, standing as she had dozens of times in the dimly-lit concrete hallway when she heard a squeal of joy coming from the yak in front of her. "I no believe it! This for Saran yak!?" She bounced up and down, shaking the lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling and making the ground tremble.\n\n"Yes, that's right," The unicorn behind the thick pane of glass built into the side of the wall chirped back, "Now please, move along and let the nice yak behind you through."\n\nThe jubilant yak before her skipped on her merry way, and Khulgana readily took her place and tried to focus on the pony passing her a check rather than the swinging overhead light. Then she saw the number written on the check itself, more than double her usual take-home pay for a week's worth of work. "Oh, this check no for Khulgana. You make mistake."\n\n"No mistake, miss." The unicorn replied with a rehearsed sweetness, as though she'd had to say this a hundred times today. "The Khatun has seen it fit to increase the wages of every worker so that they may live a life befitting the Khagante. Now please, move along and let the nice yak behind you through." \n\nIt took a second for it to click, and Khulgana reached for the check and held it as though it were made of glass. Every moment that passed, it became harder not to skip down the hall the same way her coworker had, but it was impossible not to let the tears roll down her face. She wouldn't have to skip meals so her sons could eat anymore, nor stress about deciding between paying the rent or electric bill, she could now live without worry. Turning to the paymaster one last time, Khulgana couldn't help but shout"

newjaks.30.t:0 "The Privilege of Rulership"
newjaks.30.d:0 "There had to be a link. Magnit Moonsong knew that a link must exist between the great stars in the sky, especially those closest to the moon which shone the brightest of them all, magical beasts that roamed the land, and the powerful crystals that came from deep within the earth. But to understand any of it, let alone cement any of the knowledge in scientific fact, he had to understand at least one of them, and with the ownership of several mines across the land, crystals were the obvious first step.\n\nNot that he expected the commoners under his command to understand a fraction of the secrets of the stars, but they didn't need to in order to assist in finding a connection. A team of a half dozen earth ponies and a single unicorn dragged a particularly clear chunk of crystal through the snow, its deep red structure glowing in all directions from the moonlight. "No, pull it a little more to the left, I want it perfectly aligned beneath the moon!" Moonsong spat, unable to contain his impatience. There were only so many precious minutes that this experiment could be performed, and he would not let them disappear like sand through an hourglass. They readily obeyed shifting the crystal to the side, "There! Right there that's perfect!"\n\nTaking a moment to make sure everything was in place, Magnit kept his eyes on the red glow, "Now you, unicorn, hit it with some of your magic."\n\n"With all due respect, sir, this particular kind of stone is incredibly dangerous, adding magic into the mix would make it more unstable—"\n\n"Trust that I know what I'm doing, ma'am. Or would you rather go back to the mines?"\n\nThe unicorn hesitated, casting an uncertain glance to her fellow ponies, looking almost apologetic for her next move. Her horn lit up, and a beam of pure magic shot out into the pulsating crystal, which started to grow brighter and hotter, enough to melt the snow it sat upon and boil it into steam within an instant. The ponies all started slowly backing away, but it was too late. The crystal exploded, sending a searing dome of energy out in all directions, and shards into a few of the peasants, whose wounds were seared from the heat. Three ponies were dead where they stood, and the rest were wounded, all except Magnis himself who only sighed, clasping his hooves together in prayer for the stars to accept the souls of the fallen peasants before taking out a notebook and calmly recording what had transpired, adding at the end."

newjaks.31.d:0 "A ruler can hardly reach their position of power alone, and further, they can hardly reach their highest point without someone by their side. But in Star Mountain's march to sate her eternal hunger for vengeance and fury, she hardly had the time to find someone who she could call her equal, let alone her love.\n\nToday was meant to change that, a great contest was being held in one of the larger city squares in Yakistown, and anyone who could be called anyone entered as soon as they could for her hoof in marriage. The day had started hopeful, with the certainty that by sunset, the Khatun would have met her muse, but so far, no one had even come close to clearing the high bar set for them.\n\nSome yaks displayed great feats of strength, seen only in some of the strongest bears of the Khaganate. Some griffons showed tremendous acts of courage and cunning through stunts and acrobatic performances. Even some exiles from Severyana themselves poured their hearts out to the Khatun, but their words fell on a hardened heart that wouldn't be softened. In the end, every single entry jumped their highest to at least hit the tops of their heads on the impossibly high bar, and few even saw it in their attempts to reach it.\n\nHundreds came and went from her gaze atop the high balcony, but none of them satisfied her. It was hard not to feel as far away from love as she was from any prospective partners, but then, this only made Star Mountain realize how this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. If no one could so much as stand in her shadow, then she must be a mare of singular peerlessness. This only lessened the sting of having to reject the last of the entrants, but it failed to fully remove it. Without a word, the Khatun left for her personal quarters alone, as she had so many other nights before."

newjaks.35.d:0 "Every step was agony. The cold didn't bother Star Mountain, she was no stranger to the ice or the wind, but the sensation like her hooves were held down by lead was a wholly new one, growing stronger with every step towards her old family manor. Was it anxiety? Impossible, the Khatun feared nothing! Was it unworthiness? No one on the planet could be more worthy. Perhaps it was… Guilt.\n\nAs she looked out into the blanket of fresh, powdery snow across the spanning lawn, she replayed the memories of her brother and sister chasing her across the grass, or playing as knights with sticks in their mouths, or playing with the servants as they tended to the laundry. But just as soon as the vision came, it was gone, and only the eerie silence and emptiness remained.\n\nThe filth that had murdered Star's parents and her sister at least had the decency to bury them on the land as per his last will and testimony, and as Star Mountain made her way behind the mansion, trying not to make eye contact with the mausoleum to her childhood in a country which no longer existed. But as she drew nearer down the row of apple trees that stood on either side of a pathway to the graves, she felt her stomach drop.\n\nA whirlwind of sorrow and guilt and pain, building like a typhoon within her for years since leaving the home, fully brought itself to bear just inches from the graves. If only she were stronger, she could've done something to save her family. If only she were more careful, her brother didn't have to die. If only fate was a little more fair, it would've taken her instead.\n\nHer sobs began to fill the air, her large frame heaving with every gasping breath and trembling wail, none of which calmed the maelstrom raging within her. Step softly, a dream lies buried here. The words on her sister's grave snapped something within Star Mountain, the storm within her suddenly caught fire and eviscerated any semblance of sadness. Her lips pursed into a sour line, the task ahead of her coming perfectly into view. Fate wasn't fair, but she became the instrument of fate."

newjaks.36.t:0 "The Hour of the Dragon"
newjaks.36.d:0 "'I'm starting to understand why the peasants hate Mama and Papa. They refuse to share their love for us with those who work their land, and that couldn't be more clear than what happened last night. Mama was flogging a farmer for muttering 'Celestia would be ashamed' under his breath, and Papa threatened to shoot anyone who interfered, even the farmer's own daughter. She didn't even have her cutie mark yet! Who wouldn't hate living under the hoof of two tyrants like that? They only stopped after I begged them to, and the horror of it all was so great that the filly was stunned into silence.'\n\n'When the Revolution reaches Zvezdopadovo, my one hope is that Burushka and Seva aren't caught up in its flames. They don't deserve to suffer for the awful things Mom and Dad have done. Me, well, I can take it. I'm a grown mare, if the people of Zvezdopadovo decide to shoot me, it'll be no worse than having to live with the guilt of seeing the terror in that peasant filly's eyes.'\n\nImpossible. Star Mountain flipped the journal over just to confirm that it belonged to her sister Sveta, thinking it must've been misfiled, but there was no mistake. She stared out into the immense archival building, the rows of empty tables and towering ceilings that held nothing, and couldn't help but feel just as hollow. Her own flesh and blood… A sympathizer?\n\nNothing made sense anymore, the story Star Mountain had woven over the wounds of her heart began to unravel. What if she was wrong about Mama and Papa the same way she was wrong about Sveta? What if her family wasn't innocent? What if her entire crusade was based on lies? \n\nWhat if every drop of blood shed in their name was for nothing?\n\nThe unending fire in her subsided, and for perhaps the first time in her life, Star Mountain didn't feel any rage, any thirst for revenge, or ambition."

newjaks.37.t:0 "The Phoenix on the Battleaxe"
newjaks.37.d:0 ""No!" Star Mountain barked, the words flew from her mouth almost on instinct, her voice echoing across the vacant building. Her breaths came slow and labored as her mind desperately darted across the dim archival office, as though any of its desolate features or organized shelves could give her the answer she was after. The fire that had propelled the Khatun this far refused to go out without a fight and kickstarted the rage back to the forefront of her mind like a defibrillator. The hotter it burned, the clearer the conclusion became.\n\nSure, her parents flogged the serfs, but they never did so without a reason, and besides, a couple of lashings in exchange for housing and steady work seemed like a good trade anyway. Sure, her family may have earned a bit of animosity from the socialists, but the majority of it was entirely unjustified and fabricated. Sure, Sveta sympathized with the reds, but she was naive and misplaced her bountiful mercy. The journal had just proven the maliciousness of Stalliongrad, she gave them her sympathy, and they repaid her with a bullet.\n\nMore than that, Severyana gave those fetid peasants everything, and they repaid their homeland by taking up arms against it with an army built from lies! They've bitten the hoof that's fed them their whole lives, and then expect compassion? They slaughter the families of so many, and expect mercy? Where was the mercy for Sveta? For Mama and Papa? For Seva dying in his bed? No, they have not given any semblance of compassion, so they will not be spared the full wrath of the Khaganate.\n\nStar Mountain rose to her hooves with a wicked sneer stretched across her face. In one fluid motion, she closed the journal and tucked it into her coat before marching towards the twin glass front doors. She'd found the answer she'd been after within the inferno and the frenzy that had always been there. That was now in control. Its name was Star Mountain, the last of her line, the hungry ghost, and she will bring a sweeping wave of death upon the land and purge the blight of socialism from the land!"

JAK_sm_advisor_1:0 "Dasha Solepyeraya"
JAK_sm_advisor_1_desc:0 "Dasha Solepyeraya is a name that evokes terror and fury in Ravenskoye. Noted for her cruelty and harshness against her serfs forced to labor in the salt mines, and for her near-monopoly on salt production in Severyana, her large, ancient dynasty was nearly completely toppled in the Winter Revolution. Many of her relatives faced decades in prison, while others were shot for their exploitation of the poor. She and her husband tried to fly to Trottingham, but her husband was shot down and drowned in the Celestial Sea. She only barely escaped.\n\nNow, she has joined Star Mountain's rightful crusade against the communists. She has a special hatred for pegasi who can fly better than she can, inflicting awful tortures upon them. She longs to return home to Ravenskoye to avenge her husband and retake her rightful holdings."
JAK_sm_advisor_2:0 "Magnit Moonsong"
JAK_sm_advisor_2_desc:0 "A batpony from a relatively young line, Magnit Moonsong hails from Severoholm. His family are fanatical star worshippers, especially interested in the stars near the moon. His ancestors opened several profitable mines near the city and became boyars, until the Winter Revolution took everything from them. He has always been interested in magical beasts, and the influence of stars on them as well. He is determined to discover the truth behind these mysteries, no matter the cost. The stars are right to retake Severyana, and punish the ungrateful communists who have ruined his research and mines!"
JAK_sm_advisor_3:0 "Pepel Stremennoy"
JAK_sm_advisor_3_desc:0 "The younger brother of the firstborn daughter, Pepel's family were a major transportation manufacturer. He fought with the anti-revolutionaries from the very beginning, estranged from his socialist sister, and when Celestia told the Royal Guards to stand down, he realized she was a fool. There can be no negotiation with the communist scum. The time has come to retake Severyana, and pay back the upstart serfs--with interest."

JAK_not_a_jak:0 "Abram the Editorgoat"
JAK_not_a_jak_desc:0 "The rebellious government of the Jaki-Clan rules over a largely illiterate populace, yet in the cities, many yaks read foreign newspapers and books. They often contain ideas that go against the yak Way of Life, and as such censorship is required. A strange creature offered to help Jaki-Clan with their task of cleaning up texts from abroad: Abram the goat. He offered to simply eat all paper which contained offensive or misguided text. The yaks, lacking the technology of paper shredders, happily accepted Abram's offer. It is a symbiotic relationship: Abram gets to eat all the paper he wants, while the Jaki-Clan gets to control what its subjects read. Noyak knows how a goat even got into Yakyakistan, but Abram is seen as a trustworthy honorary yak, so his backstory does not matter."

JAK_garrin_korai:0 "Garrin"
JAK_GARRIN_DESC:0 "Garrin, the fiery leader of the Ubkhait clan army is quite different than her clan's cold tradition. She is easily angered and never forgets a slight--perhaps the reason she led her clan to the Jakichikh an old grudge with Rutherford. It's rumored that this grudge dates back to Rutherford spurning her affection, but she refuses to discuss such matters. Still, she is very experienced at holding the line, and the Shield of the East will not be broken easily."

She used to have hopes. Now there's only snow, mountains, and forests. She wants to go home so, so badly. But Chrysalis, in her vast wisdom, wants the yaks as allies, and that means no return for Lucinidea."

POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of March, 971 in Yakistown.\n\n§YBiography§!: To the east of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan', a shortened version of their full name--the 'Jakichikh Clan Confederation'. A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position. Not to mention his fears of being undermined by his own so-called allies...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_STAR_MOUNTAIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 979 in Zvezdopadovo.\n\n§YBiography§!: Star Mountain, born Burushka Zvezdopadovskaya, is a true anomaly in Yakyakistan. A Severyanian noble, her parents and older sister Sveta were lynched in the Winter Revolution, leaving only her and her beloved brother Seva alive. The two of them, then teenagers, had to beg on their knees to be spared, and even then they were ordered to leave forever, eventually winding up in eastern Yakyakistan. Disease struck Seva the next year, and the primitive yak medicine was unable to save him.\n\nWhen the Jakichikh seceded, Star Mountain sided with them, but not out of ideological reasons. She knows that harmony is necessary to keep different classes and races at peace, and that was sorely lacking in both Stalliongrad and Yakyakistan, but she knew her only shot at justice for her family was to bide her time. When Kerr overthrew Bradford, she took her chance. Now that all threats to her rule are out of the way, the new Khatun of Yakyakistan, reincarnation of the great founder Prince Ulysses, stands ready to bring her vision of harmony and order to all the countries of North Equus. And then, spirits willing, to punish Stalliongrad for its crimes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"
POLITICS_STAR_MOUNTAIN_2_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 979 in Zvezdopadovo.\n\n§YBiography§!: "My name is surrounded with such hate and fear that no one can judge what is the truth and what is false, what is history and what myth. Some have called me brutal; they cannot understand as yet that I am not fighting a political party but a sect of murderers of all that is sacred and holy. And they cannot understand that I am not a pony, not anymore, for Burushka died with her brother. Only Star Mountain remains.\n\nI am the baton that hits the disharmonist, the gun that fires upon the insurrection, the axe that strikes down the communist, the inferno that burns out the changeling. I am the hungry ghost of Yakyakistan, the revenant that haunts the North, the shield against republicanism and the sword against revolution.\n\nI pledge my life and my honor to the Holy Severyanian cause, the extermination of the rebels wherever they may hide, for this night and all the nights to come. For my father, my mother, my sister, my brother, I swear by the divine stars that I shall not rest until the blight of communism is excised from this blessed continent."\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Leo"

When my time is up, I will visit the stellar judges with pride and my head held high.\n\nMother, Father, Sveta, Seva, every night I lie awake remembering you. I will make you proud.
