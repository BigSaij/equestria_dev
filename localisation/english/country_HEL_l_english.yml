### ALL THE FOCUSES OF ADELART ###

### National Focuses - Opening Tree ###

# The opening tree reacts to the balance of power that Merlock Wood has to initiate as the leader of Adelart and its communities - everything is so decentralized that the initial disparate band of revolutionaries has now formed factions vying for power - Merlock here can make certain options that will move Adelart in vastly different directions

HEL_merlocks_twentieth_year:0 "To Twenty Years of Freedom!"
HEL_merlocks_twentieth_year_desc:0 "Though times are tough and the Sheriff still tries to regain the power that he once had, Adelart remains free from tyranny. On this happy anniversary, we shall all celebrate our independence together; so long as nothing spoils the party of course."

HEL_descieuxs_petition:0 "The Émigrés' Petition"
HEL_descieuxs_petition_desc:0 "The émigrés have much to say on the way our little statelet is run and seldom speak fondly of Wood. They recognise that his leadership was necessary for the revolution to take root, but have since witnessed his lack of commitment to their cause and continually harass him for it. Perhaps - after a much deserved celebration - Wood may actually listen to what they say."

HEL_advance_the_revolution:0 "Advance the Revolution"
HEL_advance_the_revolution_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, Wood has agreed to tow the socialist line and cooperate with Descieux on most matters regarding the creation of the state. Whether this is because he has taken the time to actually read the theory he was provided or simply because he feels that the communists are his best allies is, as of right now at least, unclear."

HEL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare State of Siege"
HEL_declare_state_of_siege_desc:0 "Though they have not yet attempted to reclaim the sheriff’s realm, Griefwald remains an ever-present threat to both our independence and the budding revolution. We must make haste to prepare all that we can for the inevitable clash between us and our old masters."

HEL_revolutionary_central_command:0 "Well Regulated Revolutionaries"
HEL_revolutionary_central_command_desc:0 "Despite what some in the bands may claim, militaries tend to perform better when they’re well organised. It’s high time we put together actual divisions with the manpower currently occupying the utterly shambolic droves of bandits that Wood has granted Descieux control over."

HEL_evolve_the_bandit_territory:0 "Evolve the Bandit Territory"
HEL_evolve_the_bandit_territory_desc:0 "‘Bandit organisations’ is somewhat of an oxymoron, particularly in the way that Wood has thus far been running them. Though some level of operational freedom at a low level is necessary for effective military performance, the bottom line is that we need to reform the system into something more reliable; that should keep the émigrés more than satisfied."

HEL_the_outlaw_in_chief:0 "Eint Veralt ènd' alt Veur Eint"
HEL_the_outlaw_in_chief_desc:0 "Allowing the émigrés free reign to do as they pleased would have been a mistake. Though he doesn’t like to admit it, Wood was the griffon who united Adelart against its enemies and precluding his guidance would have only caused chaos. He shall keep the Périphérie once more and remind every creature of his capabilities."

HEL_the_merrygriffs_shall_fly_eternal:0 "The Merrygriffs Shall Fly Eternal"
HEL_the_merrygriffs_shall_fly_eternal_desc:0 "The vanguardists are little more than sheriffs in red. Their ideal for a centralised state is precisely what created the current conditions in Adelart and such ridiculous notions have no place here. We have refused Descieux’s petition wholesale and have no intention of listening to her dangerously authoritarian idealism."

HEL_free_armies_of_a_free_territory:0 "Free Armies for a Free Territory"
HEL_free_armies_of_a_free_territory_desc:0 "Whilst it may be the right of every Adelartian to organise themselves within a militia if they so choose, the vanguardists have proven to be a nuisance. They shall not be punished for their beliefs of course, instead we shall offer them the choice of leaving their militia or signing on with our bandit brigades where their political leanings will be diluted into nothingness."

HEL_the_flowenan_petition:0 "The Flowenan Petition"
HEL_the_flowenan_petition_desc:0 "Jaume de Conard is a curious character. He is perhaps the only Flowenan interested in Adelart, yet he seems to be no more outlandish than the average businessgriff from that deplorable city of banks. His interest - and that of his investors - is certainly strange; but if he can benefit our little statelet, then perhaps Wood would do well to hear his petition."

HEL_of_bankers_and_bandits:0 "Of Bankers and Bandits"
HEL_of_bankers_and_bandits_desc:0 "We are not industrialists, nor are we well-versed in anything relating to machinery in truth. It comes as no surprise then that - strange as their offer may be - de Conard and his associates have been permitted to lead economic development here. Wood has of course assigned several bandit militias for their protection, and to make sure that nothing shady is going on."

HEL_grovel_for_loans:0 "Grovel for Loans"
HEL_grovel_for_loans_desc:0 "Until very recently Flowena has been rather unwilling to lend our backwards statelet any significant amount of money. De Conard’s arrival here has - perhaps unsurprisingly - triggered a renewed interest from their banking institutions. Presumably they now see that they have a reliable griffon in whom they can place their trust and funds."

HEL_sell_the_collectives:0 "Sweet, Sweet Petrodollars"
HEL_sell_the_collectives_desc:0 "And now the jig is up. Well, we weren’t exactly trying to hide it; but most in Adelart don’t even know how valuable oil truly is, which certainly made it a surprise for them. Still, it shouldn’t come as that much of a surprise, why else would an immensely rich Flowenan industrialist be interested in a backwater like Adelart unless there was profit to be made? Let the oil flow!"

HEL_good_ol_gun_running:0 "Good Ol' Gun Running"
HEL_good_ol_gun_running_desc:0 "Some frown upon gun running, but in reality it is one of the many commodity trades that keeps the continent afloat. The trick is to make sure you’re the one with the monopoly so that the weapons don’t fall into the claws of those that shouldn’t have them. Crime is bad for business after all. Well... unless you’re the one orchestrating said crime, that is."

HEL_crack_open_revolutionary_stores:0 "Crack Open Revolutionary Stores"
HEL_crack_open_revolutionary_stores_desc:0 "Though they’re plenty dusty and very outdated by now, some relics of the independence war still exist; stored in strategically positioned caches around the country. They’re not the best, but they’ll serve us now as well as they would have done a decade ago. At least, as long as we keep them well maintained; that’s probably a little much to ask of bandits though."

HEL_community_armouries:0 "Community Armouries"
HEL_community_armouries_desc:0 "Whilst they may not be the cleanest or the most efficient production facilities, what matters is that these armouries are ours and that they work. We have no need of snooty Flowenan bankers in Adelart and by Boreas they will keep their greedy claws off our gradually emerging industry!"

HEL_keep_the_foundations_strong:0 "Of Revolutionary Foundations"
HEL_keep_the_foundations_strong_desc:0 "It’s obvious that the Flowenans are up to no good. They never leave their gilded city unless there are idols to be made and Wood was right to assume the worst with their petition. Good riddance to de Conard, and may his riches shrivel for attempting to spin his good-griff industrialist story."

HEL_disarm_dispossess_distribute:0 "The Outlaw Economy"
HEL_disarm_dispossess_distribute_desc:0 "Whilst we Adelartians are a noble people, we are no strangers to taking what we need by force. It was Wood who popularised the practice of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, and our neighbours are - relatively speaking - very rich indeed. We’re sure that they’ll forgive us for these raids... Eventually."

HEL_reprise_individuelle:0 "Reprise Individuelle"
HEL_reprise_individuelle_desc:0 "Raiding is a fundamental part of our philosophy. It may hurt some creatures, but those that we take from deserve to have their possessions repossessed. At the end of the day our operations are intended to be a net moral and economic positive, which is why we must keep doing what we’re doing. Let us free you from your excessive excesses!"

HEL_the_prelates_petition:0 "The Prelate's Petition"
HEL_the_prelates_petition_desc:0 "The self-styled prelate of Adelart is rather self absorbed, but he nevertheless chorales a significant following of griffons that are not to be trifled with. They are steadfast in their beliefs - at least for the moment - and we would do well to hear what vun Lissay has to say, even if his petition contains an enormous amount of pretentious waffle."

HEL_revoke_the_privileges:0 "Suspend Their Privileges"
HEL_revoke_the_privileges_desc:0 "The church - as with any institution of centralised power - is little more than a disaster waiting to happen. We will not punish those of the faith as there is no reason to, but we will not heed vun Lissay’s demands and for them we shall strip him of his powers. His influence is a danger to his followers and to every other creature in Adelart."

HEL_revolutionary_pilgrimage:0 "Going to the People"
HEL_revolutionary_pilgrimage_desc:0 "Though the prelate has been declawed, his followers still represent a threat and need to be neutralised. Not with force of course, but with alternative forms of proselytization. Socialism may have its more dangerous proponents, but it is fundamentally less anti-Wood than vun Lissay ever was. Let’s let the vanguardists have their fun."

HEL_voice_for_all_malice_toward_none:0 "Voice for All, Malice towards None"
HEL_voice_for_all_malice_toward_none_desc:0 "Whilst some of vun Lissay’s proposals are simply too far, his petition is largely acceptable and his goals are seemingly admirable. We have an accord with him and shall seek to implement the proposed confederal system as an alternative to a strong centralised government that frankly nogriff here in Adelart wants."

HEL_loyal_leagues_of_green:0 "Loyal Leagues of Green"
HEL_loyal_leagues_of_green_desc:0 "Though it may pain the left-leaning militia groups, formally recruiting the religious bands will grant us a surplus of ready and willing volunteers for the conflicts to come. It isn’t an ideal solution to our manpower problems, but it’s certainly serviceable as a stopgap measure."

HEL_the_free_territory_endures:0 "Mir Wëlle Bleiwe Wat mir Sinn!"
HEL_the_free_territory_endures_desc:0 "If in nothing else, Adelartians are united against invading autocrats. They have tried before and sometimes succeeded, but never again will we live idly in subjugation to another tyrant. We will stay what we are: Independent, united and strong together as a people with a shared history of ousting those that seek to see our identity buried."

HEL_bandits_priests_people:0 "Bandits, Priests, People"
HEL_bandits_priests_people_desc:0 "Though it is not entirely clear yet as to why, Wood has decided to agree to all of the demands of the Prelate’s petition. A government with vun Lissay at its centre is sure to shortly emerge and the communists shall be rooted out from Adelart for good and sent back to the dank streets of Aquileia from whence they came."

HEL_embrace_the_old_prelature:0 "The Prelate's Rightful Place"
HEL_embrace_the_old_prelature_desc:0 "Though it is a disappointment for many, it has become clear that vun Lissay must return to Wood’s side and govern Adelart with him. No doubt some will protest this considerable increase in power for the church, but it is necessary for the good of the faithful and for Adelart as a whole."

HEL_head_of_the_snake:0 "The Head of the Snake"
HEL_head_of_the_snake_desc:0 "All those years ago when we won our independence from Greifwald, we never managed to locate the sheriff. He managed to evade us, presumably under the false assumption that he could regain control once the worst had blown over. This time he will not escape. This time, we will hunt until his beak is mounted on the end of a spear for his unforgivable crimes."

### THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARMY TREE ###

HEL_the_six_companies:0 "The Six Free Companies"
HEL_the_six_companies_desc:0 "The Six Free Companies, various mercenary bands, private military companies, holy orders, and revolutionary organizations, founded at various stages in the history of Adelart, make up the backbone of all contingents outside the direct supervision of [HEL.GetLeader]'s personal army. To restore our army to a proper position, we must deal with them, and find out which are worth supporting... and which are not."

HEL_the_fliger_air_corps:0 "The Alois & Joanna Fliger Family Air Corps"
HEL_the_fliger_air_corps_desc:0 "The Fliger Air Corps, founded some time ago in 981 ALB, are a band of Feathisian pilots exiled for smuggling resources on the Flowenan black market. For profit, curiosity, or pity, they have decided to stay in Adelart as the country's only real aerial prescence, which means to control any Adelartian airspace, one must deal with the Fligers and their immense extended family."

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine:0 "A Real Air Doctrine"
HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in investing in airfields or airplanes if we do not know how to use them. Thus with airfields built and the first Adelart planes in production, we have to establish an Adelartian aerial doctrine."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control. Therefore, we should begin a new campaign to begin reigning in many of the local militia groups with promises of continued autonomy."

#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Integrate The Sisters Of Eyr"
#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_merrimane_column:0 "The Merrimane Column"
HEL_the_merrimane_column_desc:0 "The Merrimane Column, a collection of international socialist revolutionaries from Equestria and left-wing veterans of the First Aquileian Revolution, settled in Adelart at the time of their own revolution in 987 ALB. From then, they have built a reputation as a hub of militant leftism and as a place for volunteers the world over to help build the new Adelart."

HEL_haven_of_socialism:0 "A Haven of Global Socialism"
HEL_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Whilst most would shun the idea of granting safe passage and housing to socialist revolutionaries from all across the world, we have no reason to fear these like-minded creatures. [HEL.GetNameDefCap] shall operate as a safe haven and distribution network for our red friends all over the continent and beyond!"

HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Models"
HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models_desc:0 "The revolutionaries in Stalliongrad were the first to develop effective tank designs and have been exporting their designs to the red-tinted world for years. We would do well to adopt and study them for ourselves in order to diversify our armed forces and provide close support to both our regular and irregular forces."

HEL_army_of_aggression:0 "An Army of Aggression"
HEL_army_of_aggression_desc:0 "There is an ancient joke originating from the era of Grover II in which a griffon claims that offence is the best defence, then proceeds to get himself killed in a reckless charge into a well prepared enemy. That poor griff did have a point, however. Proper application of offensive tactics and high levels of autonomy amongst commanders does often lead to strategic success."

HEL_adelartian_international_brigades:0 "Form New International Brigades"
HEL_adelartian_international_brigades_desc:0 "Aside from allowing us to acquire and distribute military experience amongst the armed forces without extensive and expensive training exercises, there is another benefit to a thriving foreign volunteer network. When the time for war comes, many will answer the call to arms to protect themselves and their revolutionary hub."

HEL_to_the_barricades:0 "Chantons la Liberté, Défendons la Cite"
HEL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "As many revolutionaries are urbanites that knew how to read from a young age, it is no surprise that they are more familiar with city sprawl than most draftees. On the surface this may seem inconsequential, but detailed knowledge of a location makes for better positioning and a superb understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of urban warfare that may prove vital."

HEL_the_jade_company:0 "The Jade Company of Romau"
HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 "The Jade Company, built in 911 ALB by a dissident Senator of Romau, lack a truly centralized command following the death of the old griff who built it, but make up for it with a fanatic devotion to the Republican cause. Their recruits are many and their power broad, and although they may be particularly brutal in their fight against the monarchists, they would welcome our support with utter devotion."

HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires:0 "Tenacity of the Legionaires"
HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires_desc:0 "Romau’s knights are renowned for good reason. They may stand for principles that are largely alien to us, but their capacity to fight is nevertheless remarkable. We would do well to copy their traditions of extensive military planning at the strategic level combined with rigorous training of individual soldiers and commanders."

HEL_renew_and_revive:0 "Renew, Revive, Replenish"
HEL_renew_and_revive_desc:0 "Griffons themselves are not the only part of an army that can be healed and returned to service. Equipment, be it complex or simple, is equally as worthy of maintenance and restoration. Keeping current stockpiles functional will be of great help to our military production in the long term, even if the repaired weaponry will eventually be out of date. Better an old gun than a broken one."

HEL_the_great_river_line:0 "The Great River Line"
HEL_the_great_river_line_desc:0 "Whilst fortifications have become more complex to effectively construct and utilise, their importance has not diminished over the years. Trenches, bunkers and weapon emplacements will be constructed behind the great river that separates Verenia and the Périphérie. They will be expensive, but it is always better to spend money than waste lives."

HEL_smuggle_the_latest_tactics:0 "Moles in the University"
HEL_smuggle_the_latest_tactics_desc:0 "The Périphérie is home to many griffs that speak Herzlander and could - if required - pass as one in a pinch. Study of doctrine in such an isolated position as ours is difficult, but getting a few ‘Herzlander’ students into a private Romaun university is relatively easy. There will be plenty for us to learn in those hallowed halls."

HEL_kemerskaian_methods:0 "Learn from Kemerskai"
HEL_kemerskaian_methods_desc:0 "The republican revolution of 978 had little impact on Adelart aside from being loosely responsible for a change in management, but there is much to be learned from the conflict. Alexander Kemerskai’s proficient usage of artillery is of particular interest as it will allow us to concentrate our artillery equipment most effectively and utilise proper counter-battery tactics."

#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals:0 "Introduce Field Hospitals"
#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals_desc:0 "Field hospitals are by no means a new innovation in warfare but are new to the less organized armies of the world. With this, we should make attempts to integrate these new ideas to try to save as many of the lives of those who would risk giving it up for their nation."

#HEL_introduce_armored_cars:0 "Putting Guns On Cars"
#HEL_introduce_armored_cars_desc:0 "Motorizing warfare has been something experimented on by a few militias in our country since the revolution. We should embrace these for the entirety of our army."

HEL_the_forest_brothers:0 "The Forest Brothers"
HEL_the_forest_brothers_desc:0 "The Forest Brothers, an ancient company founded in 644 ALB, once led by Merlock Wood himself, remains one of the premier forces in the movement for Adelartian independence and national liberation. The company's tactics, however, remain based in banditry and guerilla warfare through their role in the fight against the Sheriff, and they may not be the most... easily disciplined."

HEL_dig_in_and_pray_to_eyr:0 "Dig In and Pray to Eyr"
HEL_dig_in_and_pray_to_eyr_desc:0 "A prepared defence is what gets our already limited manpower reserves home to live another day and fight another battle. There is no shame in such defensive tactics in general, but especially so under that lens. We will utilise layers of concentric fortifications to ward off any enemy that may seek to break our spirit in one quick strike."

HEL_an_impenetrable_wall:0 "An Impenetrable Wall"
HEL_an_impenetrable_wall_desc:0 "Our northern towns are quite exposed, resting at the edge of the enormous forest that makes up most of Adelart proper and thus leaving vulnerable to attack from both up and downstream. It is imperative that we construct additional fortifications in order to shore up our defences and send a message to any creature that even thinks about an invasion."

HEL_armed_to_the_teeth:0 "Armed to the Beak"
HEL_armed_to_the_teeth_desc:0 "As it turns out, many griffons that previously served in our militia forces still have the firearms that they used ready and waiting in their homes. In any other situation they would rightfully be unwilling to give them up, but with war just around the corner many would be willing to part with their weapons for paltry sums in order to support their kin on the front."

HEL_theyll_never_know_what_hit_them:0 "They'll Never Know What Hit 'Em"
HEL_theyll_never_know_what_hit_them_desc:0 "As Adeldart was reborn in a protracted guerilla war, we once again turn to the forests for guidance. There is nothing special about our trees; they do not contain the monsters of the shießwald and they don’t freeze over when it gets cold, but they certainly feel like home. They also feel like a good place to bury those that do not know the forest as we do."


HEL_recruit_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "The Sisters of Eyr"
HEL_recruit_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The Sisters of Eyr, founded in 991 ALB to serve as the personal guard of Luca vun Lissay, are armored not only by their faith but also the decomissioned tractors and hunks of scrap metal that they call tanks. Any government which seeks to appease the Prelate would be a fool to not also integrate this devoted column led by the Tankist of Eyr herself, Sister Selena."

HEL_holy_warfare:0 "The Holiness Of Tanks"
HEL_holy_warfare_desc:0 "The Sisters of Eyr vehemently claim that the tank is as sacred to us followers of Eyr as the sword and shield is to a devotee of Arcturius, for these machines of steel shield our bodies, Eyr's most holy gift, from the harm of warfare far better than knightly armour ever would.

# FIRST PATH - the VANGUARD #

### Alexandra Desiceux and her emigres, vanguardists, and pro-Aquileian communist bloc has taken control of Adelart, and essentially done a 180 on revolutionary development, transforming a state of bandit anarchy under an uneasy confederation into a would-be worker's republic. Fiercely critical of the old bandits and militias, the faith, and reactionaries, the Vanguardists are very much patronising of the average Adelartian, who they view as needing a lot of uplifting from a primitive nationalist philosophy and the opiate of religion. Still, there is much potential here for true class consciousness, and there is an element of idealism and visionary politics among the emigre's experiments in Adelart.

HEL_a_five_year_plan:0 "Hyper-industrialization"

Descieux has succeeded in her project of rapid yet well-regulated industrial expansion to a degree never before seen, exceeding even the example set by Stalliongrad."

###SECOND POLITICAL PATH - ANARCHISTS###

### Having succeeded in establishing complete primacy over Adelart for him and his bandit confederation, Merlock Wood has embraced the logical conclusions of the principles of the confederation, of autonomy, of decentralization, and of liberty for all griffons - anarchy. Transforming Adelart's anarchy from circumstance into ideology, Wood will seek to promote free association under a autonomous military apparatus that will guide Adelart to the future, and commit a bit too much violence on reactionaries, the temples, foreign powers, and perhaps even some of its own populace. Launching insurrectionary campaigns to take from the rich and give to the poor, this path largely retains the "Robin Hood" vibe.

HEL_gun_rights_anarchist:0 "Under No Pretext"
HEL_gun_rights_anarchist_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising.

HEL_intellectual_guidance:0 "A Proper Bandit Intelligentsia"
HEL_intellectual_guidance_desc:0 "To say our movement’s success was a chance matter would be putting it kindly, to say the least. It has been a struggle to proliferate our ideals even within our own borders in part because of the lack of centralised governance. Whilst we must remain vigilant for the formation of a ruling political class, it is clear that some level of mass agitation through a politically savvy intelligentsia is needed."

HEL_peoples_anarchist_army:0 "The Black and Greens"
HEL_peoples_anarchist_army_desc:0 "There is currently no organisational overlap between the nationalist militias and the anarchist partisans, to such a detrimental extent that they often end up in localised conflicts with one another by accident.

HEL_take_from_the_rich_desc:0 "Though Merlock Wood is far from what we would call an ideological ally, his principle of wealth redistribution - however ineffective his methods may have been - was not misguided.

It is they we point to when outsiders ask why things are the way they are and it is they who created the conditions necessary for our ideas to take root. The many sheriffs of yore are now long gone, yet their masters remain; for now at least."

### THIRD PATH - THE PRELATURE OF ADELART ###

### The Prelate and his steel-plated tractors and steel-plated knights have taken control of the country, pledging to restore the true practices of the Old Believers and reject any sort of hierarchical religion. Fiercely independent and quite militaristic despite a pacifistic, communitarian, and cooperative ethos, the Prelate's supporters have essentially declared war on the Archonate and the false kings and dukes of Griffonia who claim divine right. The only person with divine right, they say, is the Prophet of Eyr - a mysterious griffon from the Adelartian forests known simply as Luca vun Lissay. Soft-spoken yet with deep reservoirs of passionate sermons, Luca and his militias have a clear ethos - but may follow some cult-like practices in their desire to restore some pretty chill and courageous religious values.

### FOURTH POLITICAL PATH - SWITZERLAND ###

### Adelart reforms into a true confederation as Wood and the Prelate Luca put aside their differences and decide once again to lead Adelart against the Sheriff and Greifwald. Wood is the de-facto benefactor of the Socialist Coalition, while Luca leads Eyrite Conservatives - both parties bear a committment to decentralization, communal ethics, personal freedom, and direct democratic ideals, but economic methods ( distributivism vs. socialism ) and social methods ( revolutionary nationalism vs. a more religious, temperate social ethos ) divide two factions that the player can choose between. Wood and the Prelate remain relevant in each of their organizations, and in many ways they're a toned down version of their own paths.

HEL_rally_the_youth_desc:0 "In most contexts, militaristic youth groups are typically both radical and dangerous; but there are certainly ways to make them useful.

### FIFTH POLITICAL PATH - OIL REPUBLIC ###

### The Oil Republic is led by Jaume de Conard, yet the Flowenan-backed industrialist and all-around slimy, charismatic personality can come to power through two ways, and must carefully balance both of them. First is democratic legitimacy, needed to placate the people - his government after all, is technically a republic of the people, the fulfilling of Adelart's true mission of democracy and self-determination, to be led away from these socialist bandits and toward a new reppublican era. The Second is loyalty to his benefactors, the Flowenans, and the maintenance of their interests - control of Adelart's oil fields, friends in government, and proper industrialization. From this, the Oil Republic - a oligarchic apparatus dedicated to profit and power, yet with a shred of proper democracy and state-building regardless ( perhaps the most stable democracy out of any path ), is born.

HEL_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Let the World Know Our Name"

HEL_the_social_democrats_desc:0 "Though profit remains Conard’s primary motive, it is clear that there is only so much to be extracted from as backwater a nation as [HEL.GetNameDef].

HEL_the_flowenan_group_desc:0 "Contrary to the beliefs of some, a republic is not precluded from enjoying the benefits of authoritarianism.

HEL_send_out_the_invitations_desc:0 "Jaume De Conard's contacts in Flowena will allow us to reach potential investors that might be wary of the banking city's...reputation.

HEL_friends_in_flowena:0 "Further Ties With Flowena"
HEL_friends_in_flowena_desc:0 "The banks of Flowena are deep and their coffers are full. Because our regions are close with one another, it is only a logical step to have our business interests close with them as well.

HEL_industrialize_the_sites:0 "Industrialize the Sites"
HEL_industrialize_the_sites_desc:0 "What few exisiting industrial sites we have need to be modernized before we attempt expanding upon them.

HEL_chop_down_the_forests:0 "Chop Down the Forests"
HEL_chop_down_the_forests_desc:0 "In an age of steel, iron, and oil there is often the griffon who forgets the importance of the humble tree.

HEL_new_taxes:0 "Taxes, Taxes, Taxes"

Squeezing every idol out of our poor makes little sense, a comprehensive tax reform that shifts based upon annual income shall be a fair way forward.

adelart.1.t:0 "Twenty Days of Celebration" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.1.d:0 "Twenty years of freedom called for twenty days of celebration for the free merry griffons of Adelart. Any incredulous planners for such a tall plan were swiftly reassured by Adelart’s charming national hero – the one and only, Merlock Wood! – and soon the streets and squares of Bergelun flocked with celebration. Griffons all over Adelart were beyond eager to join these grand festivities, and for twenty days straight was Bergelun filled with fluttering party banners, scrumptious food, beautiful minstrel tunes, and cheers and drinks all around. For the peasants, local heroes, and everygriffon in between, twenty years of freedom from the tyranny of Greifwald was more a reason than any for such grand celebrations.\n\nAmong the many partygoers came the many community leaders living throughout, traveling to Bergelun not only to celebrate, but also to represent their homes in Adelart’s congressional assembly. Beyond the doors of Bergelun’s makeshift national assembly hall open to all, long ago appropriated from its use as a Griefwald court of injustice, community leaders and representatives from highly interested factions would meet for 20 days to debate and decide Adelart’s future.\n\nEverygriff in Adelart knew that tensions with Greifwald were at an all-time high and would only grow no matter how much Adelart’s population partied away. A course had to be decided, and soon, but the final decision would rest with Merlock Wood: the living legend who led Adelart to freedom. Or at least, it was widely believed so. Events across Griffonia had drawn in many new prominent groups over the last years, and many had packed a delegate or few in this year’s assembly.\n\nIt was looking to be a very devisive future for Adelart.\n\nMerlock Wood sat idly listening to the chatter throughout the court. Adjusting his green bycoket on his head, the living legend reached for his pint and took a swig."
adelart.1.a:0 "Times have changed in Adelart, but we merry griffs endure."

adelart.2.t:0 "Twenty Hours of Argument"
adelart.2.d:0 "#TODO, The first argument among communal delegations emerges, as those coming to Bergelun on behalf of the Old Believers and the Prelate feud with PAT exiles from Aquileia and other such vanguardists and idealistic revolutionaries under the command of Alexandra Descieux. Wood, understanding either faction would give him the power to pass orders against the other, decides to assemble the delegates together for a moeeting - and fast."
adelart.2.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?!?!?"

adelart.3.t:0 "Descieux's Polemic"
adelart.3.d:0 "Fancy timetabled meetings weren't Merlock's style, but that didn't prepare him for the doors to be kicked open by a retinue of red-clad, rifle-boasting Merrimane partisans. Merlock gripped an unseen pistol. "You're bold to coup me, Alexandra."\n\n"We're here to stop such a coup," squawked an undeniably Aquileian voice as Alexandra Descieux—knit in suit, tie, and prim glasses—stepped out of her score of bodyguards. "It's a plot, one you've sown against yourself for twenty years," she continued. "You and your friends have watered such a fertile soil of class consciousness, but just as the seeds have begun to flower, you choke the revolution by planting the thorns of capitalist and clerical collaboration!"\n\n"What can I say?" he said smugly. "If they're with me, they're with all of us Adelartians."\n\n"They, too, are capable of deceit," she answered back. "You speak of liberation for all, yet your younger self sought to curtail the 'freedoms' of the sheriff and his Greifwalder lords. Your newfound "friends" would have put your younger—your truer—Merlock to open shame." She slipped a folder to his table. "These are our demands. Our points are three: one, to actualise this pre-existing Adelartian communalism into a vanguard-led workers' republic; two, to bar bandits and mercenaries from participating in this republic, as they only plunder the fruits of our labourers; and three, to implement the dual-wielding policy of agricultural collectivisation and collective industrialisation."\n\nMerlock blinked as he took the document and skimmed the whole thing. At least Descieux was content that the charming face of Adelart was taking interest in this vision once more. Soon, though, when the papers were clawed back to her, she got her answer:"
adelart.3.a:0 "Promise proper centralisation will begin soon."
adelart.3.b:0 "Promise a socialist philosophy while maintaining Wood's own primacy."
adelart.3.c:0 "Decline Descieux's request - our free territory must endure!"

adelart.4.t:0 "The Prelate's Confession" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.4.d:0 "“Seems I was right about your age slowly catching up.”\n\nMerlock glanced up from his meal and found a very elderly griffon hunched before him adorned in simple robes with a walking staff . To any foreigner, this beyond ancient Priest of Eyr seemed fragile enough to be knocked over with but a simple poke, but the griffons of Adelart knew very well the tales surrounding him.\n\nMerlock smiled, remembering how true the tales were of those unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of that staff. “Nonsense, Luca,” he gestured for his friend to sit, “I get better with age.”\n\nPrelate Luca vun Lissay chuckled as he obliged, “Only by faith can you hope to live as long as I.”\n\nMerlock laughed, “Of course, by faith, and by not standing in front of your armored tractors.” The two compatriots spoke reminiscently of the old times they had together and the many more adventures that culminated with Adelart’s independence. They talked about their shared past like the old friends they were, and only when the sun was well set and other patrons had left did the Prelate finally bring up the topic he wanted to speak of.\n\n“Merlock, many of the faith are concerned with the “Going to the Griffons” movement. I’ve seen PAT operatives in Adelart trying to stir up anti-clerical sentiments and communistic leanings in the shadows. You might think it good for everygriffon to be heard, but it’s a far cry from democracy: it’s populism manipulated to strip away the self-determination of our temples and Adelart’s institution of governance we fought for. Something has to be done, Merlock, and it has to be done soon.”"
adelart.4.a:0 "Order the exiles to suspend operations in rural territories."
adelart.4.b:0 "Permit PAT propaganda, but ban anti-clerical operations."
adelart.4.c:0 "Decline the Prelate's request - the temple is not without scrutiny!"

adelart.5.t:0 "An Unexpected Petitioner"
adelart.5.d:0 "#TODO, Jaume de Conard, the slimy, handsome, devilish industrialist himself, goes and meets Merlock Wood at the dying stages of the congress. He critiques both the church and the communists and says Wood that he will gladly faciliate a true democratic transition and arrange international legitimacy for the Forest Brothers - with a few deals from his good friends in Flowena. Claiming to hold a large amount of money and stores, he offers to build up industry with flowenan loans and part of his own money and that of the reform faction - as long as a republic arrives... and Flowena is paid from Wood's own coffers."
adelart.5.a:0 "We need the money... and the arms!"

The violent tendencies of revolutionaries would be wiped away, and peace would come to the forests. Now began the work of administration, and all shall return to as it was before that Anarchist Wood ever tainted this land.\n\nThen, a knock came upon the Sheriff's door. Putting down his quill and parchment, Nottemagne opened the door. A nervous page sat waiting for him outside the door, "Sherif, sir, you have a priest here to see you." he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "But it's not just that..."\n\nNottemagne laughed and pushed the page to the side, "Ah, yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, "And I am sure whatever surprise they have waiting for me will surely be a great one!" The Sherif was happy. He had always been faithful to Boreas above, removing the godless communists and doing his service to the rightful prelate of Greifwald. Now all his hard work was coming back to repay him.\n\nMoving down the hallways of his office in Eagleton, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way, he noticed most of the usual staff did not seem to be there. It must be Saturday he presumed, and moved along. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside, a rhythmic droning that rattled his skull and shook his mind. Pushing through, he exited the building and suddenly stopped, digging his talons into the floor, he tried to stammer out words but could not. In front of him stood rows and rows of griffons in the robes of peasants and religious orders lined up with various relics and tomes in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the Archons in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most frightening of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon the most, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power and your life! The true believers shall have a home once more in these sacred forests! For Boreas, who leads us, Eyr, who feeds us, and Arcturus, who sends you to damnation!"\n\nWith this, the Sherif felt a sharpness on his back. Turning around, he saw Sister Selena, leader of the sisters of Eyr, with a blade on the back of his neck. "By the will of the gods, you are dethroned Sherif."\n\n"Because Eyr has come to Adelart.""

"It is best not to assume your verdict ahead of time, sir."\n\nAt a dining chamber-turned-makeshift court, Merlock's beak was strapped shut. Shoved to a seat, he scanned the seats where his proud compatriots had once toasted and cheered with mirthful drinking. In their place, dry suits accompanied silent eyes whose stares accused him.\n\nHe read—or listened—between the lines of the judge's words. That was not what pained him, for out another door snaked a line of normal griffons—some he recognised from farms and little forest hamlets, the very same ones he freed years or decades ago—ready to speak ill against him, how his insistence on raids and pillages had left the would-be working class stunted, babied as helpless peasants fit only to be swooped by reaction's vultures the moment Merlock and his happy gang were out of the picture. The twenty-year high, the judge proclaimed, would finally end, with the proletariat awaking from its bandit-induced stupor.\n\nThey would awake with a beheading.\n\nThough restrained, he snapped the beak-straps to cry, "This was a coup all along! You are all sheriffs! Red sheriffs!" A beating followed, his famous bycoket ripped from his head as a penultimate emasculation. So dazed was he, that it was only at the top of the platform—now finding himself at the end of a march, in a quiet glade—that he saw the blade.

Old imported Aquileian machines and their manuals were carted into a factory-in-the-makin.

It's partly my fault; much of the works written about the vanguard were based on more, say, urban settings. Clearly, some growing pains must be braved, since the revolution here faces the danger of being muddled by a blind revolt from the peasants."

## Socialists in the Confederation

adelart.29.t:0 "Back to Aquileia"
adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called “Vanguardists” cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as “betrayal of the socialist ideal” and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."
adelart.29.a:0 "A commendable move."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"
adelart.30.a:0 "We will never be slaves, to other communists nor monarchists!"

## Eyrites in the Confederation

adelart.59.t:0 "A Vote Of No Confidence" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.59.d:0 "He should’ve expected this. He really should have expected this. The (in)famous bandit hero of Adelart was many things from charismatic to guile, but if there was one thing the Prelate knew about Merlock Wood, it was that the griffon was reactionary. Here and now in Adelart’s woods, the old griffon was proven correct.\n\n“Temperance, Merlock, temperance,” the Luca said, “I honestly thought you would foresee this being a possibility.”\n\n“After everything I’ve done for Adelart?! All I’ve risked and sacrificed?!” Merlock flung another throwing knife into the nearby tree.\n\n“You act as if they sentenced you to death.”\n\n“No, you don’t have a say,” Merlock seethed with a pointed talon, not even bothering to look at the Prelate, “I bet you even organized the vote in the first place to take charge.”\n\nLuca’s staff knocked aside the talon with a thwack, causing the off-guard Merlock to yelp. The Prelate bore into the bandit. “You’ve been nothing but a valiant thief for decades, Wood, longing for the thrill of adventure that often landed you into a fight. Even after another victory against Greifwald, when Adelart was ready to rebuild itself, what did you do instead? You’re out here gallivanting in the woods. You could barely stand the makeshift government prior. So, tell me, Merlock, what have you done to win over this new Adelart’s confidence for being responsible and stable? Or are you going to lead a bandit rebellion against this government too?”\n\nThis time Merlock shot a glare at Luca before going to retrieve his throwing knives embedded in the nearby tree. “So what am I to do now, mister elected figurehead?”\n\n“Buy a home? Enjoy retirement?” Luca shrugged, turning to leave, “Go about your life as usual? Maybe even reconvene with your political party and learn how to properly manage it within the Federal Council? Do whatever, Merlock, but do so knowing you need not worry for Adelart’s future anymore. I pray the best for you...and I wish you goodbye.”"

The Municipal Bands of Vilistel and the Guild of Vilistel Infrastructure are very just and humble service groups dedicated towards the community. Those Eyrist conservatives won’t find anything lacking!”\n\n“Then which one will you be representing on our town council?”\n\n“I can’t represent both?”\n\nAcross the table, Wiltz lowered his head in exhaustion. As Vilistel’s deputy, he had gathered every local figurehead he could find and brought them to the town hall – the biggest tavern in town – and sat them down to finally decide upon who would serve as councilmembers to represent their home on the Federal Council of Adelart. Many other towns across Adelart’s new and old provinces had already established their town councils comprised of their own local groups, leaving but a few towns that still haven’t remaining. Be it the town of Vilistel that so happen to be one of them...\n\nThe most elderly griffon at the table spoke up, “Does Griffon Garments need more than one representative?” The discussions around the table quickly faded out of respect, and the deputy raised his head. “No, Mrs. Moselle,” Wiltz assured, “You are more than capable of representing your charity on your own if you’d like.”\n\n“Thank you, mister deputy, so very kind of everycreature.”\n\n“Does that mean I need another griffon to join the Municipal Bands?” Alezette asked.

The belligerence in the evening air, however, indicated that having their leaders all gather at once wasn’t perhaps the best of ideas. The six groups bickered amongst themselves while the seventh sulked quietly in a shadowy corner.\n\n“The workers of Adelart deserve better!” a pony of the Merrimane Column argued, her mishmash volunteers of Aquilian griffons and ponies from Equestria agreeing.\n\nA decorated member of the Jade Company scoffed, “Perhaps, but they would achieve more under guidance of those they choose to lead them.”\n\n“Eegh, and I thought we were the radicals...” a griffon from the Forest Brothers groaned, more attentive to picking dirt out of his old trench shovel, “Just because ya got some kooky ideas doesn’t mean ya know the land like our gang.”\n\nThe lone, fully armored behemoth of a griffon let out a low chuckle, the green plume atop his helmet bobbing with his laugh, “Thy repartee is ironic to the Knights of the Green Harp.”\n\n“Least they know to protect themselves and others proper,” remarked Selena of the Sisters of Eyr, “Your order charges beakfirst into a fray with meager defenses.”\n\nThe green plumed helmet turned to the Selena, “...thou fights with tanks.”\n\n“The only way to protect our bodies, precious gifts of Eyr they are!”\n\nThe two Fligers griffons, Joanna and Alois , glanced about the conversation before whispering to each other. “Mom, should we tell them that we can easily solve all of this with our aircrafts?"\n“No, let’s see if Adelart’s government can even offer us something worthwhile first.”\n\nAll in all, the groups continued to bicker. Not even coming together to offer their services to Adelart was enough to quell their bickering, nor make them all cooperate together."

They had purposefully estranged themselves from the other six, but nocreature was complaining. After all, they were the Black Talons – the Schwarze Krallen – and to associate with them openly only bore ill and public disdain.\n\n“We have griffons,” one griffon spoke, “Good soldiers, yes.”\n\n“Well organized and prepared,” said a second griffon, “Equipped and ready.”\n\nTheir leader flapped his wings, and the whispering fell silent. The griffon reached towards his hooded face and scratched under his beak. “Death is like taxes and change: it is inevitable. We believe that Adelart may soon become its precipice. Be it the deliverer or receiver, that is to be decided, but we wish to offer our services.”\n\n“Our little bodies,” the first one spoke, “Our little divisions.”\n\n“Griffons despise us for the truths we follow,” added the second, "but truths they are nonetheless."\n\nThere was a pause, and then a question. “Are you...Maarites?”\n\nThe leader fumbled and turned to his two companions before answering, “Erm, for all intents and purposes, we’re a simple mercenary group.”\n\nNo other answer could be coaxed out of them, though it was evident why they were apart from the rest of the assembly. Yet here they were offering their martial assistance to Adelart.

adelart_flavor.1.t:0 "The End Of A Dynasty"
adelart_flavor.1.d:0 "The ancient Sweetsinger dynasty that once ruled Adelart, before the times of Greifwaldian sheriffs and opressive Discret monarchs, has lost its final heir.\n\nLeonald Sweetsinger, a farmer and public servant in Vilistel, and last known member of his dynasty, passed away last night at the age of 60. Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and the rare government minister who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs,at one point in history asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."
adelart_flavor.1.a:0 "In time, all things must come to an end."

adelart_flavor.2.t:0 "Fichtl's Festival"
adelart_flavor.2.d:0 "Controversy has emerged in a small forest town outside Herlein on the Greifenmarscher border, where an investigation over sounds of disturbing melodies and perpetual revelery led to the uncovering of a bizarre pacifist and envionmentalist religious sect that has taken to worshipping a griffonian forest deity, Fichtl. Worship of the forest deity, questioned revelers claim, was a centuries old tradition among the isolated peasants, which many claim predated the establishment of the Trinitarian faith all together. Effigies of Fichtl, a tree with a Griffonian face upon it, have been found all across the forest towns, hand-crafted, woven, and stuffed by local artisans, while local bards sing the songs of the faith to adoring crowds.\n\nOutraged Old Believer authorities have labeled the movement heresy and idolatry, and a local priest noted that the effigies of the god were "unsettling to the point where I thought a Maarite spirit had brought such disgust and rancor upon my soul". The local council leader claims that the festivals were all "in good fun" and that mobs of Old Believer followers were making a fuss over a centuries-old tradition. Fichtlites interviewed merely claimed the festivals were a way to "appreciate the bounty of Fichtl and call attention to the lovely environment we all share, and which is being destroyed by the march of industry", and that the childish effigies were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nWith the Old Believers and community leaders at odds, it falls to [ROOT.GetLeader] to determine the fate of this obscure festival. The question is - could these festivals be merely be cover stories for heresy?"

adelart_news.1.t:0 "A Prophet Rises"
adelart_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Disturbing news has come out of the Aquileian periphery. An old, ragged priest of the Griffonian goddess Eyr by the name of Luca vun Lissay, backed by thousands of his faithful followers, often wielding nothing but clubs, swords, axes, and the rags on their back, has seized control of the Trade Federation of Skyfall. Appointing himself Venia III, rightful Archon of Eyr, Luca has made calls to the global community to stand against the decadence of the Archons and their imperial masters, rallying behind the banner of the true Archon of Eyr to bring a new religious awakening of community, faith, and temperance. Striving for "a reformation of the Griffonian faith", the Prophet of Eyr, as his supporters call him, has developed a dangerous movement - one that might see more and more griffons come under its sway."

merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean de Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the church, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
luca_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Luca vun Lissay, leader of the Old Believers in Adelart and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place. As long as he is in charge, the nobles shall once more flee in terror, and the faithless shall do nothing more but bow their heads to the Gods above.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
luca_archon_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Archon Venia III, prophet of Eyr and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters.

Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Venia III was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Arhconate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is perhaps most odd, then, than the griffon who was so fanatically against the Archonate, would become one himself, the Archon of Eyr and leader of the faithful of Griffonia. However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power. No longer shall Venia III's Archons be chosen by oligarchy and nobility - they shall be chosen from and by the truly faithful, wherever they may be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
selena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 961 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: Selena Krafsherr has been fighting for the faith her entire life. Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

sheriff_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of November, 951 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: No one is quite sure how the Sheriff of Adelart is still alive, with all the vitriol and hatred levied against him, nor how he has continued to be a sizable thorn in the side of the Adelartian government. 20 years ago, Jean de Nottemagne pursued the bandit Merlock Wood and his allies in the Old Believer faith, raiding towns, demanding taxes and levies from peasants who might have hoarded him and his rebel allies. Now, however, the tables have turned. Merlock Wood is the leader of a free territory for griffons of all stripes, while Nottemagne has been forced from town to town with a small army of loyal griffs and armed tax collectors.\n\nNottemagne, however, has emulated Wood's elusive spirit, and is never found at the same town twice. While mercenaries and Forest Brothers alike pursue him, the Sheriff of Adelart always stays one step ahead, raiding villages for taxes to fill his war chest and griffons to join his roving army. When Forest Brothers catch him, the Sheriff's forces fight like rabid beasts, the Sheriff front and center at the vanguard. He may have lost an eye and all of his dignity in the guerilla war against his former domain, but his perserverance has not wavered.\n\nAdelart will be cleansed from banditry, and the Sheriff will regain his rightful seat!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

A notable monarchist who does not even try to hide his distaste for the free territory's unique democracy, Trouillard fought in the revolution against Greifwald for Adelartian patriotism, not for Wood's values.\n\nEventually, Trouillard would leave Wood's Forest Brothers, and although he continued to serve in the armed forces, his loyalty toward Wood's government quickly faded. Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"
