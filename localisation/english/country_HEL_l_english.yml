### ALL THE FOCUSES OF ADELART ###

### National Focuses - Opening Tree ###

### THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARMY TREE ###

HEL_the_six_companies:0 "The Six Free Companies"
HEL_the_six_companies_desc:0 "The Six Free Companies, various mercenary bands, private military companies, holy orders, and revolutionary organizations, founded at various stages in the history of Adelart, make up the backbone of all contingents outside the direct supervision of [HEL.GetLeader]'s personal army. To restore our army to a proper position, we must deal with them, and find out which are worth supporting... and which are not."

HEL_the_fliger_air_corps:0 "The Alois & Joanna Fliger Family Air Corps"
HEL_the_fliger_air_corps_desc:0 "The Fliger Air Corps, founded some time ago in 981 ALB, are a band of Feathisian pilots exiled for smuggling resources on the Flowenan black market. For profit, curiosity, or pity, they have decided to stay in Adelart as the country's only real aerial prescence, which means to control any Adelartian airspace, one must deal with the Fligers and their immense extended family."

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine:0 "A Real Air Doctrine"
HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in investing in airfields or airplanes if we do not know how to use them. Thus with airfields built and the first Adelart planes in production, we have to establish an Adelartian aerial doctrine."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control. Therefore, we should begin a new campaign to begin reigning in many of the local militia groups with promises of continued autonomy."

#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Integrate The Sisters Of Eyr"
#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_merrimane_column:0 "The Merrimane Column"
HEL_the_merrimane_column_desc:0 "The Merrimane Column, a collection of international socialist revolutionaries from Equestria and left-wing veterans of the First Aquileian Revolution, settled in Adelart at the time of their own revolution in 987 ALB. From then, they have built a reputation as a hub of militant leftism and as a place for volunteers the world over to help build the new Adelart."

HEL_haven_of_socialism:0 "A Haven of Global Socialism"
HEL_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Whilst most would shun the idea of granting safe passage and housing to socialist revolutionaries from all across the world, we have no reason to fear these like-minded creatures. [HEL.GetNameDefCap] shall operate as a safe haven and distribution network for our red friends all over the continent and beyond!"

HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Models"
HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models_desc:0 "The revolutionaries in Stalliongrad were the first to develop effective tank designs and have been exporting their designs to the red-tinted world for years. We would do well to adopt and study them for ourselves in order to diversify our armed forces and provide close support to both our regular and irregular forces."

HEL_army_of_aggression:0 "An Army of Aggression"
HEL_army_of_aggression_desc:0 "There is an ancient joke originating from the era of Grover II in which a griffon claims that offence is the best defence, then proceeds to get himself killed in a reckless charge into a well prepared enemy. That poor griff did have a point, however. Proper application of offensive tactics and high levels of autonomy amongst commanders does often lead to strategic success."

HEL_adelartian_international_brigades:0 "Form New International Brigades"
HEL_adelartian_international_brigades_desc:0 "Aside from allowing us to acquire and distribute military experience amongst the armed forces without extensive and expensive training exercises, there is another benefit to a thriving foreign volunteer network. When the time for war comes, many will answer the call to arms to protect themselves and their revolutionary hub."

HEL_to_the_barricades:0 "Chantons la Liberté, Défendons la Cite"
HEL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "As many revolutionaries are urbanites that knew how to read from a young age, it is no surprise that they are more familiar with city sprawl than most draftees. On the surface this may seem inconsequential, but detailed knowledge of a location makes for better positioning and a superb understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of urban warfare that may prove vital."

HEL_the_jade_company:0 "The Jade Company of Romau"
HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 "The Jade Company, built in 911 ALB by a dissident Senator of Romau, lack a truly centralized command following the death of the old griff who built it, but make up for it with a fanatic devotion to the Republican cause. Their recruits are many and their power broad, and although they may be particularly brutal in their fight against the monarchists, they would welcome our support with utter devotion."

HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires:0 "Tenacity of the Legionaires"
HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires_desc:0 "Romau’s knights are renowned for good reason. They may stand for principles that are largely alien to us, but their capacity to fight is nevertheless remarkable. We would do well to copy their traditions of extensive military planning at the strategic level combined with rigorous training of individual soldiers and commanders."

HEL_renew_and_revive:0 "Renew, Revive, Replenish"
HEL_renew_and_revive_desc:0 "Griffons themselves are not the only part of an army that can be healed and returned to service. Equipment, be it complex or simple, is equally as worthy of maintenance and restoration. Keeping current stockpiles functional will be of great help to our military production in the long term, even if the repaired weaponry will eventually be out of date. Better an old gun than a broken one."

HEL_the_great_river_line:0 "The Great River Line"
HEL_the_great_river_line_desc:0 "Whilst fortifications have become more complex to effectively construct and utilise, their importance has not diminished over the years. Trenches, bunkers and weapon emplacements will be constructed behind the great river that separates Verenia and the Périphérie. They will be expensive, but it is always better to spend money than waste lives."

HEL_smuggle_the_latest_tactics:0 "Moles in the University"
HEL_smuggle_the_latest_tactics_desc:0 "The Périphérie is home to many griffs that speak Herzlander and could - if required - pass as one in a pinch. Study of doctrine in such an isolated position as ours is difficult, but getting a few ‘Herzlander’ students into a private Romaun university is relatively easy. There will be plenty for us to learn in those hallowed halls."

HEL_kemerskaian_methods:0 "Learn from Kemerskai"
HEL_kemerskaian_methods_desc:0 "The republican revolution of 978 had little impact on Adelart aside from being loosely responsible for a change in management, but there is much to be learned from the conflict. Alexander Kemerskai’s proficient usage of artillery is of particular interest as it will allow us to concentrate our artillery equipment most effectively and utilise proper counter-battery tactics."

#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals:0 "Introduce Field Hospitals"
#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals_desc:0 "Field hospitals are by no means a new innovation in warfare but are new to the less organized armies of the world. With this, we should make attempts to integrate these new ideas to try to save as many of the lives of those who would risk giving it up for their nation."

#HEL_introduce_armored_cars:0 "Putting Guns On Cars"
#HEL_introduce_armored_cars_desc:0 "Motorizing warfare has been something experimented on by a few militias in our country since the revolution. We should embrace these for the entirety of our army."

HEL_the_forest_brothers:0 "The Forest Brothers"
HEL_the_forest_brothers_desc:0 "The Forest Brothers, an ancient company founded in 644 ALB, once led by Merlock Wood himself, remains one of the premier forces in the movement for Adelartian independence and national liberation. The company's tactics, however, remain based in banditry and guerilla warfare through their role in the fight against the Sheriff, and they may not be the most... easily disciplined."

HEL_dig_in_and_pray_to_eyr:0 "Dig In and Pray to Eyr"
HEL_dig_in_and_pray_to_eyr_desc:0 "A prepared defence is what gets our already limited manpower reserves home to live another day and fight another battle. There is no shame in such defensive tactics in general, but especially so under that lens. We will utilise layers of concentric fortifications to ward off any enemy that may seek to break our spirit in one quick strike."

HEL_an_impenetrable_wall:0 "An Impenetrable Wall"
HEL_an_impenetrable_wall_desc:0 "Our northern towns are quite exposed, resting at the edge of the enormous forest that makes up most of Adelart proper and thus leaving vulnerable to attack from both up and downstream. It is imperative that we construct additional fortifications in order to shore up our defences and send a message to any creature that even thinks about an invasion."

HEL_armed_to_the_teeth:0 "Armed to the Beak"
HEL_armed_to_the_teeth_desc:0 "As it turns out, many griffons that previously served in our militia forces still have the firearms that they used ready and waiting in their homes. In any other situation they would rightfully be unwilling to give them up, but with war just around the corner many would be willing to part with their weapons for paltry sums in order to support their kin on the front."

HEL_theyll_never_know_what_hit_them:0 "They'll Never Know What Hit 'Em"
HEL_theyll_never_know_what_hit_them_desc:0 "As Adeldart was reborn in a protracted guerilla war, we once again turn to the forests for guidance. There is nothing special about our trees; they do not contain the monsters of the shießwald and they don’t freeze over when it gets cold, but they certainly feel like home. They also feel like a good place to bury those that do not know the forest as we do."


HEL_recruit_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "The Sisters of Eyr"
HEL_recruit_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The Sisters of Eyr, founded in 991 ALB to serve as the personal guard of Luca vun Lissay, are armored not only by their faith but also the decomissioned tractors and hunks of scrap metal that they call tanks. Any government which seeks to appease the Prelate would be a fool to not also integrate this devoted column led by the Tankist of Eyr herself, Sister Selena."

HEL_holy_warfare:0 "The Holiness Of Tanks"
HEL_holy_warfare_desc:0 "The Sisters of Eyr vehemently claim that the tank is as sacred to us followers of Eyr as the sword and shield is to a devotee of Arcturius, for these machines of steel shield our bodies, Eyr's most holy gift, from the harm of warfare far better than knightly armour ever would. Needless to say, perhaps they are right after all?"

HEL_jumpstart_heavy_industry:0 "Jumpstart Heavy Industry"
HEL_jumpstart_heavy_industry_desc:0 "As our army clamours for ever-increasing demands of not only firearms and field guns, but armoured vehicles as well, we must begin moving away from barn workshops and clandestine imports and towards the establishment of proper arsenals to satiate our needs. The forges of the temple of Arcturius in Lissay shall roar at our new initiative!"

HEL_focusing_on_land_production:0 "Land Production Focus"
HEL_focusing_on_land_production_desc:0 "TODO - "

HEL_we_were_not_meant_to_fly_higher:0 "Condemn the Idea of Aircraft"
HEL_we_were_not_meant_to_fly_higher_desc:0 "We griffons, proud sons and daughters of Eyr, shall never turn to these infernal, rickety machines that many call \"airplanes\", for they pierce and sully the domain of the gods above the clouds.\n\n And besides, would our all-loving mother Eyr not scorn us for rejecting the confidence in our own divinely gifted wings?" 

HEL_the_new_knights:0 "The Knights of the Green Harp"
HEL_the_new_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of the Green Harp are the oldest of the Six Companies, tracing their descent back to a personal guard founded in 498 ALB to protect the gracious and House Sweetsinger, Counts of Adelart before the imposition of the ignoble, barbaric Shrievalty. Failing to defend their Count, these knights have remained in Adelart ever since, seeking a leader who can once again unite the realm."

HEL_every_griffon_a_knight:0 "We Are All Knights"
HEL_every_griffon_a_knight_desc:0 "To say that the path to knighthood is a path only a highborn may undertake is to spit on the teachings of both Arcturius and Eyr themselves, for a knight's greatest act of sacrifice is to cast aside his differences to aid his brothers-in-arms, for division shall be our fall, but unity shall be our strength!"

HEL_the_gallant_and_the_brave:0 "De Gallant An Déi Dapp"
HEL_the_gallant_and_the_brave_desc:0 "\"De Gallant An Déi Dapp\", or The Gallant And The Brave, is an old Adelartian folk tale of two errant knights slaying beast and evil-doer alike, their unfaltering resolve not even shaken by Maar himself. It is thus within our best interest to preach the tale to all, for every knight shall then go into battle inspired by the divine bravery of the two griffons of legend."

HEL_the_warriors_of_the_gods:0 "The Warriors Of The Gods"
HEL_the_warriors_of_the_gods_desc:0 "As the numbers of our rank and file swell with the fresh blood of newly inducted knights and zealous griffons-at-arms, it is imperative that we provide these crusaders and banner-bearers of the gods with only the finest of weapons and strongest of armour, for the era of fighting for the cause of some distant noble in rags and with a hunting musket is all but behind us now."

HEL_convert_the_tractors:0 "Convert The Tractors"
HEL_convert_the_tractors_desc:0 "While we may possess no local tank plant of our own, we are certainly in no shortage of farm tractors! We shall set forth and requisition any and all excess tractors from the countryside and convert them into proper armoured fighting vehicles with whatever boiler plate steel, machine guns or cannons we can find."

HEL_holy_warfare_time:0 "Holy Warfare"
HEL_holy_warfare_time_desc:0 "We, soldiers of Arcturius, Boreas and Eyr above all, fight not for the coin, the noble or out of despair, but for an ideal.\n\n The ideal of enlightenment of the self, the friend and the foe, the defense of our homes, and Eyr's blessed promise of a fulfilling life.\n We shall fight for the will of the gods!"

HEL_guarded_behind_armor_and_metal:0 "Steel And Metal, Guide Me Well"
HEL_guarded_behind_armor_and_metal_desc:0 "With the blessing of Eyr from the heavens, the prayers of our loved ones behind us, and the chants of our crusaders motivating us forward, it is time for us to advance onward, shielded from the darkness by our holy armour!"

HEL_we_need_some_actual_military_tactics:0 "An Actual Military Academy"
HEL_we_need_some_actual_military_tactics_desc:0 "Establishing a new academy to train our officers will make sure that we can draw on a trained office staff if we ever must call upon them to defend their nation."

HEL_what_makes_us_griffons:0 "What Makes Us Griffons"
HEL_what_makes_us_griffons_desc:0 "It will do us no good to mindlessly import tactics of the West or South without any care for the races they are prescribed to. Instead, we must embrace who we are and who Boreas made us to be - free griffons, greedy and self-concieted perhaps, but born to fly and resilient 'til the end."

#HEL_learning_tank_models:0 "Tank Models"
#HEL_learning_tank_models_desc:0 "Tanks are a new generation of warfare that we have many of the resources needed to draw upon, mainly our vast oil reserves. This is a great advantage that we should put to use as much as possible."

HEL_plane_stuff:0 "Black Market Airplane Models"
HEL_plane_stuff_desc:0 "Developing new airplane models to protect our soldiers from the skies will be a great boon to how effectively our military can fight to defend Adelart. Unfortunately, we do not have airplane models. However, the Fligers have pointed out we can easily secure second-rate models on the black market and through their own Feathisian connections - as long as we don't get caught."

HEL_promote_the_fligers:0 "The Fligers in Government"
HEL_promote_the_fligers_desc:0 "We shall appoint Joanna Fliger and her son Alois into the highest positions in government, so that perhaps we can finally have some griffons with aerial expertise within the ranks of Adelart's foremost political and military leaders. If they stick to their trade of the air force, it will be a greatly beneficial partnership indeed."

HEL_alois_plan_destruction_above_all:0 "Alois Recommends: Destruction Above All"
HEL_alois_plan_destruction_above_all_desc:0 "The great thing about terror bombing is in the name. It’s terrifying and terribly effective, especially when targets include industrial and military infrastructure. Prioritising maximum munition deployment and subsequently the greatest level of destruction will inevitably render our enemies unable to advance."

HEL_joanna_plan_tactics_and_strategy:0 "Joanna Recommends: Tactics and Strategy"
HEL_joanna_plan_tactics_and_strategy_desc:0 "Airborne tactics are not something that most can easily appreciate, being as difficult to witness in action as they are to actually execute. Nevertheless, Joanna’s insistence on drills for such things have come to fruition and our pilots are expected to begin training on some of these manoeuvres shortly."

HEL_fate_of_maarite_militia:0 "The Seventh Company"
HEL_fate_of_maarite_militia_desc:0 "A bizarre militia known as the "Schwarze Krallen", or Black Talons, has risen in the darkest forests of Adelart, bearing the name of the great bandit leader Blacktalon from when Adelart was still an independent state.

# FIRST PATH - the VANGUARD #

### Alexandra Desiceux and her emigres, vanguardists, and pro-Aquileian communist bloc has taken control of Adelart, and essentially done a 180 on revolutionary development, transforming a state of bandit anarchy under an uneasy confederation into a would-be worker's republic. Fiercely critical of the old bandits and militias, the faith, and reactionaries, the Vanguardists are very much patronising of the average Adelartian, who they view as needing a lot of uplifting from a primitive nationalist philosophy and the opiate of religion. Still, there is much potential here for true class consciousness, and there is an element of idealism and visionary politics among the emigre's experiments in Adelart.

HEL_defenders_of_the_revolution:0 "Gardes Rouges de la Forêt"
HEL_defenders_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Originating as an intelligence outcropping of Wood’s bandit operations, the Gardes Rouges de la Forêt have long since pledged their allegiance to our cause. Their skills have evolved over the years from simple woodland espionage into a full-blown intelligence organisation, one that we can now attach to the state in an official capacity."

HEL_eradicate_the_old_believers:0 "Eradicate the Old Believers"
HEL_eradicate_the_old_believers_desc:0 "Though they claim their intentions to be noble, the Old Believers are a threat to the proliferation of the revolution and Desiceux’s authority. We would do well to eliminate their most staunch supporters in order to secure our base of power and ease the transition to a centralised, marksist state."

HEL_begin_the_anti_anarchist_platform:0 "Teaching Peasants Politics"
HEL_begin_the_anti_anarchist_platform_desc:0 "What some in Adelart do not know, it seems, is the basic principles on which this world governs and upon which revolutionary policy is ought to have been based on. The teachings of idealistic banditry must be cast down and replaced with proper materialism and praxis, lest we fall further into rabid anarchy.\nWhat have they been teaching these griffs?!"

HEL_bolster_the_intellectuals:0 "A Revolutionary Intelligentsia"
HEL_bolster_the_intellectuals_desc:0 "Whilst some socialists may turn up their beaks at the idea that an intelligentsia can or even should exist within a marksist society, the reality of our situation necessitates some irregularities in doctrine. The revolution arose here in a backwater where industry is yet to become widespread, thus we must foster a new political class that can lead those who are yet to see."

HEL_permanent_revolution:0 "Instill Class Consciousness"
HEL_permanent_revolution_desc:0 "The peasantry of Adelart has been fooled into submission by the bandit warlords who dare to label themselves "socialists", and have directed the furor that should be levelled at the bourgeoisie at the nobility. While these labels may originally have intersected, true class consciousness has yet to have found its way into the hearts of Adelart's people."

HEL_congress_to_centralism:0 "A New Congress"
HEL_congress_to_centralism_desc:0 "We have come a long way from trusting bandits to ensure the security and wellbeing of our people, but there is much to be done still. What we are politely calling a government is little more than a bunch of rowdy ideologues squabbling in a town hall, at least for the moment. The time has come to organise a new congress and begin the process of forging a real administration."

HEL_strengthen_the_chairgriff:0 "A Chairgriff With Claws"
HEL_strengthen_the_chairgriff_desc:0 "Descieux recognises that it was Merlock’s own adherence to his principles that resulted in his end. He was no more powerful than any other creature in his unscrupulous little band, which was precisely what allowed our new chairgriff to take charge. Our state shall make no such mistakes, vesting significant powers in Descieux’s government position."

HEL_kill_bandits:0 "Hang the Bandits"
HEL_kill_bandits_desc:0 "Whilst their tenacity in the face of overwhelming odds was to be admired, the bandits of Adelart are no longer of any use to us. They have never been true allies of the revolution and only assisted us in an attempt to save their own feathers. It may be a shame to some, but they must be removed in order to secure the state against its enemies."

HEL_reject_the_gods:0 "No Such Thing as "Adelartian""
HEL_reject_the_gods_desc:0 "We are Markists, the harbingers of proletarian democracy.\nWe are Aqulieians, sons of that great revolutionary culture.\nWe are liberators as well, protectors and educators of this nation.\nYet we do not call ourselves "Adelartians", that twisted amalgamation of peasant mentality and cultural barbarity.

HEL_descieuxs_betrayal_desc:0 "Alexandra Descieux has betrayed Merlock Wood and secured state power for herself and her young revolutionaries.

HEL_a_head_shorter:0 "A Head Shorter"
HEL_a_head_shorter_desc:0 "Although Merlock Wood has delivered Adelart true vanguard socialism in recent months, in truth, the only thing stopping us from a true revolutionary government is the bandit leader himself.

HEL_optimize_production:0 "Optimization, Specialization, Innovation"
HEL_optimize_production_desc:0 "Now that we control a larger industrial base with which to experiment, the time has come to improve our existing industrial practices. From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs is not simply a matter of providing for the needy; but also an opportunity for the providers to develop particular skills in certain fields."

HEL_conscript_the_squatters_desc:0 "There is a very simple solution to the homeless that remain: Hire the impoverished as recruits for the armed forces. They may need some time to accumulate a sufficient amount of muscle mass for fighting fitness, but that will come in time. For the unfortunate it’s a job and a second chance, for us it’s more recruits for our glorious revolution!"

HEL_the_first_domino:0 "The First Domino"
HEL_the_first_domino_desc:0 "Pomovarra is not unlike the Adelart of old in its position as somewhat of a backwater in the Périphérie, a status that makes it of particular interest to the military as an easy target. Not only that but its borders protect the city of Flowena, making the territory a vital stepping stone for future military operations in the region."

HEL_the_second_domino:0 "The Second Domino"
HEL_the_second_domino_desc:0 "Flowena - no matter who is in charge - is a city of the self-interested bourgeoisie and all manner of kleptocrats. Adeldart was once close to falling to its influence, a fact that the state has not been forgotten in the years since the vanguard solidified its power. The time has come to eliminate these pests and bring their city into the fold."

HEL_core_pom_and_flo:0 "New Revolutionary Administrations"
HEL_core_pom_and_flo_desc:0 "Whilst they may not initially be appreciated by the local residents, new local governments are a necessity in order to secure our newly acquired territories.

HEL_revolutionary_discipline_desc:0 "With the resources of a vast region in our claws, the time has come to reinforce the discipline of our battle-hardened forces. Experience means little in a theatre of war that is unfamiliar and no future conflict will be like the last. Training, retraining and further weathering of our soldiers is absolutely necessary for the survival of the revolution."

HEL_defer_to_madame_guillotine:0 "Defer to Madame Guillotine"
HEL_defer_to_madame_guillotine_desc:0 "Some say that executions are immoral, but there are few reactionary problems that a guillotine cannot solve.

HEL_visionary_economics_start:0 "A Visionary Economic Theory"
HEL_visionary_economics_start_desc:0 "The time has come to abandon the old Adelart’s obsession with stagnancy and backwards ruralism. Whilst their adherence to such antiquated economic practices is understandable given that any change would have meant appealing to the sensibilities of tyrants, they need no longer fear oppression. Now is the time for industry, innovation and progress!"

HEL_complete_collectivization:0 "Complete Collectivization"
HEL_complete_collectivization_desc:0 "Unlike many griffon states, [HEL.GetNameDef] is unique in that its economy has been organised communally for quite some time already. Reshuffling these quid-pro-quo councils into true collectives should be a relatively simple affair, facilitating future marksist economic reforms."

HEL_central_planning:0 "Planning for the People"
HEL_central_planning_desc:0 "A state-planned economy remains a rather novel concept to most in [HEL.GetNameDef], used to subsistence farming as the population is. With a centralised government in place and the administration’s growing pains fading, the time has come to familiarise the population with the benefits of our economic model with new factories and work for the workless."

HEL_centralize_scientific_advancement:0 "The Red Universities"
HEL_centralize_scientific_advancement_desc:0 "Marksism spreads fastest through those that can read and comprehend Marks’ work for themselves, making academia a breeding ground for red-tinted movements. All we need to do is find the teachers and lecturers that kept their sympathies quiet under the Sheriff’s watchful eye and allow their classes to become as politically charged as they deserve to be!"

HEL_urban_economics_start:0 "Adelart and the Future"
HEL_urban_economics_start_desc:0 "Rapid economic development is tricky when your population lacks a significantly sized middle class that can invest in new technologies, but it is not impossible. State grants and technology imports should help in getting our industrial revolution on its claws, naturally creating a state-directed economy in the process."

HEL_expand_public_schooling:0 "A School in Every Township"
HEL_expand_public_schooling_desc:0 "State schooling is such a necessity in the modern era that many non-communist regimes have already adopted the practice to varying extents. Whilst they are expensive to construct and operate, schools are an economic investment in the future of any state and will return the cost required to create them tenfold in the skilled and conscious work forces that they create."

HEL_import_aquileian_teachers:0 "Import Aquileian Educators"
HEL_import_aquileian_teachers_desc:0 "Though they are typically radical and fiery even by our revolutionary standards, Aquileian intellectuals and teachers are some of the best in the world and some of the most sympathetic to our socialist cause. With some incentive - and considerable grumbling from the locals - we will become a safe haven for left-leaning intellectuals seeking to bestow their invaluable knowledge."

HEL_a_unique_advantage:0 "A Unique Advantage"
HEL_a_unique_advantage_desc:0 "Adelart sits upon one of the largest inland oil deposits in Griffonia, granting us access to an economically and strategically valuable resource that many of our neighbours sorely lack. Though it will anger the sedentary few that currently live atop the black fields, it is imperative that we expand extraction operations at once for the survival of the revolution."

HEL_nationalized_oil:0 "Take Control of the Reserves"
HEL_nationalized_oil_desc:0 "With our resource-rich land fully developed, we can now cement our loose claw-hold over the industries. With the companies operating still in their infancy, they can be purchased and conglomerated in a state enterprise for a relatively minimal sum. Our reserves shall fuel the revolution and never line the pockets of paper pushers!"

HEL_fuel_our_future:0 "Fuel Our Future"
HEL_fuel_our_future_desc:0 "A modern war is ultimately a war of resources. Whilst Adelart is not entirely barren in this department, our currently exploited metal deposits will not be sufficient in the long term.

HEL_peoples_republic_of_oil:0 "Oiling the Gears of Industry"
HEL_peoples_republic_of_oil_desc:0 "Thanks to our unusually large oil reserves, we have a surplus of industry experts with many ideas on how to further improve production of our army’s black blood.

HEL_cut_a_swathe_through_the_forests:0 "Cut a Swathe Through The Forests"
HEL_cut_a_swathe_through_the_forests_desc:0 "Though it is a shame to sully Adelart’s stunning natural beauty, the immense woodlands of the region ultimately limit the available space for industrial development. Pain the locals as it may, deforestation shall make way for massive industrial upscaling. Eventually even the forest dwelling remnants of Wood’s bandits will face and embrace progress."

HEL_a_five_year_plan:0 "Hyper-industrialization"
HEL_a_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Given the state of poor old Adelart, anyone could be forgiven for assuming our industrial project would fail miserably; but we have turned the country into an economic powerhouse in spite of the many problems that we faced. Descieux has succeeded in her project of rapid yet well-regulated industrial expansion to a degree never before seen, exceeding even the example set by Stalliongrad."

###SECOND POLITICAL PATH - ANARCHISTS###

### Having succeeded in establishing complete primacy over Adelart for him and his bandit confederation, Merlock Wood has embraced the logical conclusions of the principles of the confederation, of autonomy, of decentralization, and of liberty for all griffons - anarchy. Transforming Adelart's anarchy from circumstance into ideology, Wood will seek to promote free association under a autonomous military apparatus that will guide Adelart to the future, and commit a bit too much violence on reactionaries, the temples, foreign powers, and perhaps even some of its own populace. Launching insurrectionary campaigns to take from the rich and give to the poor, this path largely retains the "Robin Hood" vibe.

HEL_merlocks_band_triumphant:0 "Merlock's Band Triumphant"

HEL_stabilize_the_movement:0 "Informal Anarchist Federation"
HEL_stabilize_the_movement_desc:0 "Whilst it is regrettable to some, a semblance of structured governance is required for the organisation of services and in particular the armed forces.

HEL_suffer_no_gods:0 "No More Friendly Friars"
HEL_suffer_no_gods_desc:0 "Though they have served [HEL.GetName] dutifully, the prelate and his followers are now a threat to our system and our people.

The time has come to deal with Luca and his followers in the only acceptable manner: violently."

HEL_gun_rights_anarchist:0 "Under No Pretext"
HEL_gun_rights_anarchist_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising.

HEL_intellectual_guidance:0 "A Proper Bandit Intelligentsia"
HEL_intellectual_guidance_desc:0 "To say our movement’s success was a chance matter would be putting it kindly, to say the least. It has been a struggle to proliferate our ideals even within our own borders in part because of the lack of centralised governance. Whilst we must remain vigilant for the formation of a ruling political class, it is clear that some level of mass agitation through a politically savvy intelligentsia is needed."

HEL_peoples_anarchist_army:0 "The Black and Greens"
HEL_peoples_anarchist_army_desc:0 "There is currently no organisational overlap between the nationalist militias and the anarchist partisans, to such a detrimental extent that they often end up in localised conflicts with one another by accident.

HEL_take_from_the_rich_desc:0 "Though Merlock Wood is far from what we would call an ideological ally, his principle of wealth redistribution - however ineffective his methods may have been - was not misguided.

HEL_democracy_of_the_communes:0 "Refine the Peasant Councils"
HEL_democracy_of_the_communes_desc:0 "Adelart shall never stand for the whims of corrupt politicians.

Never shall we act in our own interest, for then we would not be true servants of Adelart."

HEL_the_remaining_sheriff_supporters:0 "The Remaining Sheriff Supporters"
HEL_the_remaining_sheriff_supporters_desc:0 "Despite his complete moral bankruptcy and backwards ideological leanings, the sheriff still has a choice few supporters here in [HEL.GetName].

HEL_anarchist_war_on_greifwald:0 "A Revenge Five Hundred Years in the Making"
HEL_anarchist_war_on_greifwald_desc:0 "In a curious twist of irony, it is the sheriffs we have to thank for their merciless commitment to antiquated styles of government. It is they we point to when outsiders ask why things are the way they are and it is they who created the conditions necessary for our ideas to take root. The many sheriffs of yore are now long gone, yet their masters remain; for now at least."

HEL_on_banditry:0 "Propaganda vun der Akt"
HEL_on_banditry_desc:0 "Actions speak louder than words. They can shake or shape societies far more than simple words ever could, which is precisely why we must lead by example.

To act against tyranny is to be immortal."

### THIRD PATH - THE PRELATURE OF ADELART ###

### The Prelate and his steel-plated tractors and steel-plated knights have taken control of the country, pledging to restore the true practices of the Old Believers and reject any sort of hierarchical religion. Fiercely independent and quite militaristic despite a pacifistic, communitarian, and cooperative ethos, the Prelate's supporters have essentially declared war on the Archonate and the false kings and dukes of Griffonia who claim divine right. The only person with divine right, they say, is the Prophet of Eyr - a mysterious griffon from the Adelartian forests known simply as Luca vun Lissay. Soft-spoken yet with deep reservoirs of passionate sermons, Luca and his militias have a clear ethos - but may follow some cult-like practices in their desire to restore some pretty chill and courageous religious values.

### FOURTH POLITICAL PATH - SWITZERLAND ###

### Adelart reforms into a true confederation as Wood and the Prelate Luca put aside their differences and decide once again to lead Adelart against the Sheriff and Greifwald. Wood is the de-facto benefactor of the Socialist Coalition, while Luca leads Eyrite Conservatives - both parties bear a committment to decentralization, communal ethics, personal freedom, and direct democratic ideals, but economic methods ( distributivism vs. socialism ) and social methods ( revolutionary nationalism vs. a more religious, temperate social ethos ) divide two factions that the player can choose between. Wood and the Prelate remain relevant in each of their organizations, and in many ways they're a toned down version of their own paths.

HEL_the_confederation_of_communities:0 "The Confederation of Communities"
HEL_the_confederation_of_communities_desc:0 "Merlock Wood and the Prelate Luca have charted a course together that would bring democracy and equality to Adelart - the only question is, who will lead their shattered coalition?"

HEL_switzerland_desc:0 "While direct democracy does provide our populace the most fair and equal way of participating in the governance of the state, certain examples of direct democracy across Griffonia have shown the problems such a system causes it's relied upon too much. Therefore a federal council will be established in order to take care of issues that are too minor for the entire populace of Adelart to consider."

HEL_confederal_war_on_greifwald:0 "The Torchbearers of the Confederal Revolution"
HEL_confederal_war_on_greifwald_desc:0 "Our revolution is not unlike the that which the vanguardists and woodists wish for in that it is our ethical obligation to export it for the benefit of all, but that is where the similarities end. Our confederation is not an internationalist entity, but a beacon of peace and stability in an otherwise violent Périphérie. We shall undo the wrongs of the past; not with ideology, but with peace."

HEL_gun_rights:0 "A Gun for Every Griffon"
HEL_gun_rights_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising.

HEL_support_the_old_believers:0 "Autonomy for the Temples"
HEL_support_the_old_believers_desc:0 "The majority of the population of Adelart is comprised of highly religious griffons.

This is why we will increase support to the religious communities in order to become friends with them."

HEL_decentralized_education:0 "Autonomy for the Teachers"
HEL_decentralized_education_desc:0 "For a democratic, especially directly democratic, system to work, the populace needs to be knowledgeable enough to realize what is best for them.

HEL_nation_of_volition:0 "A Nation of Volition"
HEL_nation_of_volition_desc:0 "The cantons can only exist with the consent of the governed on the principle of volition.

HEL_distance_from_extremism:0 "Purge Iliberal Socialists"
HEL_distance_from_extremism_desc:0 "While Adelart has been accused of being radicals and lunatics by many foreigners, these claims are mostly absurd and laughable.

HEL_the_first_unions:0 "The First Unions"
HEL_the_first_unions_desc:0 "Adelart has never been an industrialized region. And without industry there was never a need for unions among the inhabitants of Adelart before the revolution.

HEL_wealth_for_the_workers_desc:0 "While the workers of Adelart are free from Greifwaldian oppression, many of them still suffer from poverty and the problems that it causes.

HEL_eyrian_socialism:0 "Socialism Through Eyr"
HEL_eyrian_socialism_desc:0 "The griffons of Adelart, be they from the rural or the urban environment, are highly religious.

Our ways are simply not based on the material realm, but inspired by that which is divine - faith in the Goddess Eyr."

HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles:0 "One Big Community"
HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles_desc:0 "There are many small towns and villages that are scattered across the forests of Adelart.

HEL_left_nationalism:0 "Left-Wing Nationalism"
HEL_left_nationalism_desc:0 "Adelart is and will hopefully always will be a realm of socialist workers and farmers. However, differently from most socialist workers, the griffons of Adelart do not see themselves as part of some international group. Rather they choose to still identify with the Adelartian culture.

HEL_social_funds:0 "A Social Fund"
HEL_social_funds_desc:0 "The church's charity can only go so far. A Social Fund must be set up for our poorer communities that are suffering in this time of change. Well-timed and modest grants will empower local entities to solve their own problems effectively at the ground level."

HEL_eyrian_charity:0 "Bread, Rice, and Idols"
HEL_eyrian_charity_desc:0 "We cannot afford to forget our most destitute in these trying times. The church shall use its vast influence in Adelart to provide charity to those in need, all of which will be subsidized and supported by the current administration."

HEL_encourage_large_families:0 "Eyrite Family Laws"
HEL_encourage_large_families_desc:0 "It is only in recent years that Adelart has passed a million griffons in its territory. As our standard of living inscreases, our birthrate goes down. Therefore, we must make it appealing and beneficial to have a large family by offering subsidies and tax cuts."

HEL_agrarianism_focus:0 "Safeguard Rural Traditionalism"
HEL_agrarianism_focus_desc:0 "The majority of our population may reside in urban centers, but the true heart of Adelart is found outside of the cities.

HEL_subsidize_the_farms:0 "Peasants into Farmers"
HEL_subsidize_the_farms_desc:0 "It is time that we return to our roots, quite literally.

HEL_eyrite_values:0 "Temperance, Diligence, Community"
HEL_eyrite_values_desc:0 "In an effort to curb poverty and properly commit to our promises of direct democracy, our government shall make initiatives to form local citizen's councils.

HEL_confederal_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Though it was not our intention, much of Aquileia has come under our direct control as a consequence of their attempted invasion.

HEL_move_against_greifwald:0 "Liberate the Vassals"
HEL_move_against_greifwald_desc:0 "For most of history, Vinovia, Rila and Westkeep have been subject to the wants and needs of the presiding government in Aquila with little say over their own affairs.

HEL_alliance_with_pomovarra_desc:0 "Pomovarra remains one of the last remnants of regional republican democracy in the Periphery and indeed, all of Griffonia. [POM.GetLeader] has forged democracy from the ashes of the Aquileian collapse, just as we have. We must ally with them and eventually pursue unification under a common language and culture, or both of our nations will enter the dustbin of history."

HEL_invite_avian:0 "Avian in the Pact"
HEL_invite_avian_desc:0 "Avian has endured a history of rule from Griffenheim and - unsurprisingly - does not wish to now be ruled from Aquila. We do believe that they would be interested in an alliance however, and as such we shall offer them a position in the pact for strategic defence against the enemies of peace on Griffonia."

HEL_invite_flowena:0 "Protection for Flowena"
HEL_invite_flowena_desc:0 "Though Flowena is wealthy, its practices of hiring mercenaries to defend itself are not sufficient protection in the modern age of immense militaries and even larger industries. Without help, the city would be put to siege and obliterated by any foe willing to wait. In the hopes of avoiding such a situation, we will offer them a position in the pact."

HEL_propose_pomovarran_unification:0 "Propose Pomovarran Unification"
HEL_propose_pomovarran_unification_desc:0 "Adelart and Pomovarra have long held cultural ties to one another, ties that have only grown stronger as time passes. Now that we have inherited the role of the region’s largest political entity, it is only sensical that we offer Pomovarra cantonhood within our confederation; retaining autonomy and joining their brothers in arms."

HEL_unified_democratic_government:0 "The Plea for Legitimacy"
HEL_unified_democratic_government_desc:0 "Though we have militarily conquered Aquileia, our new government lacks the recognition that their centuries-old political order did.

HEL_curtail_estates:0 "Crush the Estates"
HEL_curtail_estates_desc:0 "Landowners have held immense sway over the functioning of Aquileian governments for centuries, causing immense discontent amongst the less privileged.

HEL_expand_self_management:0 "Expand Self-Management"
HEL_expand_self_management_desc:0 "Unions exist in a unique situation, simultaneously without direct representation in the government and yet able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of griffons in protest when necessary. In order to smooth over negotiations and increase productivity, we will grant official unions the right to organise their own workplaces within the bounds of other regulatory statutes."

HEL_union_political_machine:0 "Unionized, Urban Political Machines"
HEL_union_political_machine_desc:0 "Though unions are commonplace, the government still has the ability to ignore their demands if they consider it absolutely necessary. Whilst in times of war this may be acceptable, in all other circumstances it is disgraceful. The canton’s creatures are to be heard and the city unions will make sure the government listens."

HEL_democratic_cult_of_personality:0 "Hero Of Our New Democracy"
HEL_democratic_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Though he doesn’t like to admit it, Merlock Wood was the first amongst us to recognise the need for socialist progress in moderation. From the rich to the poor, the voices of the many before the voices of the few. His ideals are responsible for the construction of the cantons in all and - make a fuss of being hailed as a hero as he may - it is a well deserved title."

HEL_recognize_prelate_ebonwing:0 "Recognize Prelate Ebonwing"
HEL_recognize_prelate_ebonwing_desc:0 "Luca vun Lissay and his puppets in the communities controlled Adelart for twenty years. Now that we control all of Greifwald's core territory, we can finally remove Luca vun Lissay without large-scale protest, and recognize Prelate Ebonwing as rightful religious leader of Greifwald, even if we continue to support secular policies on all levels of government."

HEL_expand_nationalization_programs_desc:0 "There are many industries and elements of infrastructure that are of such importance that financing them out of the state’s budget is the best way to guarantee their longevity.

HEL_expand_eyrite_social_programs_desc:0 "Whilst our cultural roots lend us a naturally charitable outlook upon those less fortunate, current institutions provide less than we would ideally like. It is time we enshrined charity in law to create a truly social state out of our preexisting preferences."

HEL_rally_the_youth:0 "Pro-Democracy Youth Leagues"
HEL_rally_the_youth_desc:0 "In most contexts, militaristic youth groups are typically both radical and dangerous; but there are certainly ways to make them useful. If the state provides the means for such groups to operate, the groups will naturally favour the state and will struggle to survive without it. With this in mind the cantons can easily create and maintain, pro-democracy and pro-reform youth groups."

HEL_reject_distributism:0 "Remembering Boreas' Prosperity"
HEL_reject_distributism_desc:0 "Though our communal roots have not been entirely translated into the modern realities of governance and capitalism, we still provide for the less fortunate.

HEL_strike_pyt_desc:0 "The Griffon Empire weakens with each passing day and our Herzlandish brothers to the our north are shackled by the shadow of that Empire. The "Peasant Republic" must be liberated so that we can be united together in a true democracy! For Freedom! For Adelart!"

HEL_core_pyt:0 "Integrate Greifenmarschen"
HEL_core_pyt_desc:0 "We have been successful in annexing Greifenmarschen, but we must take the time to enlighten our brothers and sisters to the true path to freedom.

HEL_strike_pom:0 "Topple the Pomovarran Plutocracy"
HEL_strike_pom_desc:0 "Our brothers and sisters in Pomovarra are not in dire straits, for they live under their enlightened oligarchs! What use is their oligarchy though? They have good rulers now, but in a few years they might turn into despots! We will strike now to give the people of Pomovarra a choice in who rules them with the power of the ballot!"

HEL_strike_flo:0 "The Vaults of Flowena"
HEL_strike_flo_desc:0 "Our business connections in Flowena have helped us nurture our young economy, but it does not take a seer to understand what Flowena does with its gold. Their oligrachs horde it away from their people, stealing it from all of Griffonia! We will liberate that city of gold and use its funds to help build our more perfect union, Eyr help us!"

HEL_limited_urbanization:0 "Limited Urbanization"
HEL_limited_urbanization_desc:0 "We must carefully encourage excess agrarian workers to migrate to the cities, but we cannot blindly bring them in enmasse!

HEL_gradual_industrialization_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization almost always seems to lead to suffering, but it is not something to scorn either. We will take a more moderate path.

HEL_continue_land_reform:0 "Continue Land Reform"
HEL_continue_land_reform_desc:0 "To think that land reform itself will bring about an equitable system? That is misguided. To deny the power of reform though? That is foolish.

HEL_encourage_arts_and_theatre:0 "Promote The Arts"
HEL_encourage_arts_and_theatre_desc:0 "A society's culture is its voice and its legacy, so we will ensure that our arts will be supported with copious grants dedicated to them. Adelart, in a few years, will be known as a rich center of the arts with its own unique culture!"

HEL_oil_agrarian:0 "Dig Shallow And Carefully"
HEL_oil_agrarian_desc:0 "For years we have known of Adelart's riches beneath the ground, but if we exploit the oil for profit alone we endanger ourselves. We listen to our scientists, oil is a finite resource. We will extract it at a measured pace to bolster our economy, but not make our economy reliant upon it."


### FIFTH POLITICAL PATH - OIL REPUBLIC ###

### The Oil Republic is led by Jaume de Conard, yet the Flowenan-backed industrialist and all-around slimy, charismatic personality can come to power through two ways, and must carefully balance both of them. First is democratic legitimacy, needed to placate the people - his government after all, is technically a republic of the people, the fulfilling of Adelart's true mission of democracy and self-determination, to be led away from these socialist bandits and toward a new reppublican era. The Second is loyalty to his benefactors, the Flowenans, and the maintenance of their interests - control of Adelart's oil fields, friends in government, and proper industrialization. From this, the Oil Republic - a oligarchic apparatus dedicated to profit and power, yet with a shred of proper democracy and state-building regardless ( perhaps the most stable democracy out of any path ), is born.

HEL_de_conards_republic:0 "The Oil Republic"
HEL_de_conards_republic_desc:0 "Whether by trickery or legitimate democratic means, Jaume de Conard has found himself at the helm of a new Adelartian Republic. Whether or not he focuses on cementing his own power and pleasing his gracious benefactors in Flowena, or building a democratic Adelart based on the principles of the Aquileian Republicans, is up to him."

HEL_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Let the World Know Our Name"
HEL_revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "The Aquileian refugees that came to our territories following their first revolution's failure have shown us that the Republican cause is our cause wherever it is found! It must be made clear that any republic on any continent is our friend!"

HEL_an_end_to_wood_desc:0 "Merlock Wood and his socialist thugs have plauged our country for twenty years. We once thought him as a liberator, but now we see the danger.

HEL_the_social_democrats:0 "Focus on Nation-Building"
HEL_the_social_democrats_desc:0 "Though profit remains Conard’s primary motive, it is clear that there is only so much to be extracted from as backwater a nation as [HEL.GetNameDef]. Whilst some may turn up their beaks at the idea of spending money before making some, Conard recognises the potential in a return on investment here in the Périphérie."

HEL_the_flowenan_group:0 "Full Control for de Conard"
HEL_the_flowenan_group_desc:0 "Contrary to the beliefs of some, a republic is not precluded from enjoying the benefits of authoritarianism. Whilst De Conard would prefer a soft application of his power, it is absolutely imperative that he remains on top of the figurative pile. After all, idols keep the world turning; and he shall always have the most."

HEL_market_war_on_greifwald:0 "Shatter the Crown of Greifwald"
HEL_market_war_on_greifwald_desc:0 "For centuries Adeldart has been trampled by imperial rulers that barely registered our people’s existence.

HEL_the_aquilean_model:0 "The Republic of Greifwald"

HEL_polizei:0 "De Geheimdéngscht"
HEL_polizei_desc:0 "Our citizens deserve the right to a local security force, but across our territories we need a fair entity to enforce our nation's laws that is not limited by county lines.

HEL_real_healthcare:0 "Private Healthcare Services"
HEL_real_healthcare_desc:0 "Prayers and apothecaries might cure colds or magical ailments, but they do not treat diseases, remove tumors, or care for trauma patients. We must ensure the right to effective healthcare with real hospitals and real doctors - for the right price."

HEL_nurture_new_business:0 "Our Own Industry"
HEL_nurture_new_business_desc:0 "A free market of a free territory must be regulated, however this means we also have a responsibility to support new business in our lands. By offering grants to key industries, we can support the new businesses that arises around them."

HEL_a_haven_for_business:0 "A Haven for Foreign Development"
HEL_a_haven_for_business_desc:0 "Our opponents that used to sit on the left side of the aisle painted Adelart as a haven for the working griffon, but that is not profitable. What can be done is the lowering of corporate taxes and deregulation of labor laws. Through these reforms we shall make Adelart a capitalist's dream!"

HEL_a_powerful_executive:0 "A True President"
HEL_a_powerful_executive_desc:0 "The office of the Speaker has never been more then a way to honor our country's father in Merlock Wood. As we establish our centralized government, we need a Speaker that can ensure it is just. Granting the office new executive power will enable us to react faster to new threats from outside and within."

HEL_abolish_the_congress:0 "No More Congresses"
HEL_abolish_the_congress_desc:0 "The congresses were designed to give the people a voice, but they are a shrill chorus ruled by a mob mentality. The representatives the people choose are fickle, dependent on pleasing those who elected them. They are incapable of seeing the bigger picture for our country. We will salvage the useful assets from the congresses and impose a new chamber."

HEL_the_parliamentary_system:0 "Adopt the Assemblée Nationale"
HEL_the_parliamentary_system_desc:0 "We will expand our legislature to mimic the national assembly of the Aquileian model, our deputies will ensure that the voice of their constituents are heard in the matters of the nation!"

HEL_a_real_university:0 "The Adelartian Meritocracy"
HEL_a_real_university_desc:0 "With greater control of all our government's assets, we are able to put forward generous subsidies to attract academics to Adelart. With the best and brightest in Griffonia coming to support us, it is only right we construct a meritocratic strcture worthy of Adelart's future leaders."

HEL_a_secular_adelart:0 "Nothing More Than Figureheads"
HEL_a_secular_adelart_desc:0 "Faith empowers, but we cannot let faith have power. The corruption of the church when it meddles with government is clear, but we will protect everyone's right to worship. However, there will be a clear separation between church and state."

HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts:0 "Silence Them Completely"
HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts_desc:0 "Luca vun Lissay and their Old Believers would be useful allies in the fight against socialist ideology, but their penchant for needless charity stirs the pot. We cannot allow the church to hold a great deal of influence among the common people. We will censor their broadcasts or silence them entirely."

HEL_a_new_banking_capital:0 "Governance of the Idol"
HEL_a_new_banking_capital_desc:0 "Through careful economic and political manipulation, we have created a captalistic paradise that rivals our friends in Flowena and outshines even the oligarchs of the Skyfall Federation. For only in Adelart are all griffons equal under the idol!"

HEL_a_free_and_modern_adelart:0 "Governance for the Future"
HEL_a_free_and_modern_adelart_desc:0 "Our reforms are already bearing fruit, the future of Adelart is not one of tyranny or anarchy. We look upon her now with solemn pride, for she is a nation that protects, educates, and nutures its people. We are not a territory, a mob of forest bandits with ideals; but a republic of free griffons."

HEL_capitalism_in_adelart_desc:0 "We are a backwater cesspool of industry, but we have the capability for so much more. We will have to realize our potential for industrial expansion and growth, which means that we have to embrace the values of a free market head on with open arms."

HEL_sell_off_the_collectives:0 "Sell Off The Collectives"
HEL_sell_off_the_collectives_desc:0 "The one useful thing that the communists did for Adelart was consolidating all of the land into collectives for us. Now that we are in control, we can sell these collectives back to their original owners or their competition with a healthy profit."

HEL_send_out_the_invitations:0 "Invite the Investors"
HEL_send_out_the_invitations_desc:0 "Jaume De Conard's contacts in Flowena will allow us to reach potential investors that might be wary of the banking city's...reputation. A few promises here about access to Lissay's oilfields, a few promises there about having some institutions named in their honor, and a 'no-questions-asked' policy about the origin of the money should attract many wealthy griffons."

HEL_friends_in_flowena:0 "Further Ties With Flowena"
HEL_friends_in_flowena_desc:0 "The banks of Flowena are deep and their coffers are full. Because our regions are close with one another, it is only a logical step to have our business interests close with them as well. With a few generous trade agreements and concessions, we can get a claw in the door where we have not before."

HEL_industrialize_the_sites:0 "Industrialize the Sites"
HEL_industrialize_the_sites_desc:0 "What few exisiting industrial sites we have need to be modernized before we attempt expanding upon them. We will have to arrange several deals in order to secure new machines, trucks, and a more skilled labor pool. This might mean we have to cut a deal or two with the unions, but at the heart of capitalism is compromise."

HEL_the_great_conard_bank:0 "The Grand Bank of Conard"
HEL_the_great_conard_bank_desc:0 "Our efforts in attracting investors has not gone unnoticed, and now, the opening of the Grand Bank shall soon commence. While loans from Flowena and Skyfall may be seen as higher quality, it is clear that our unscrupulous methods and tolerance of seedy investors will provide a lucrative loan market in Adelart."

HEL_research_stuff:0 "The Jan Roycen School of Commerce"
HEL_research_stuff_desc:0 "A smarter work force will generate smarter ideas, and what better way to instill the glorious ideas of opportunity, free thought, and economic progress than our very own business school! Jan Roycen, the former bandit leader of Adelart preceding our very own Merlock Wood, will truly enter into history through the great school of learning that shall bear his name!"

HEL_jacob_oil_3:0 "Oil Barons in Government"
HEL_jacob_oil_3_desc:0 "If the great oil reserves of Lissay and Eagleton are to become the centerpiece of our new economy, why should the owners of that land not be involved in our new government? New ministers must be appointed from among the boards of our new corporations, so that we can work claw in claw with such valuable citizens."

HEL_jaume_oil_1:0 "Exploiting Our Oil Reserves"
HEL_jaume_oil_1_desc:0 "Black gold, it is called, and gold it is, for Adelartian oil reserves will make our government more money than any tax policy could ever accomplish. However, to expolit our oil reserves, we must secure them, and establish mines and refineries across the entirety of the country. Such a policy will employ our own workers and fill our own pockets."

HEL_jaume_oil_2:0 "The Great Oil Trade"
HEL_jaume_oil_2_desc:0 "All of Griffonia begs for Adelartian oil, and we shall answer them!\nBy building up our infrastructure and establishing new trade policies, we can truly build up the supply for Griffonia's hungry bureaucrats and politicians to expolit the resources of Adelart. As more and more oil flows through Griffonia, more and more money will come to Adelart."

HEL_into_the_factories:0 "Into The Factories"
HEL_into_the_factories_desc:0 "Not every griffon is destinited to be a soldier, a farmer, or a priest. With the expansion of factories in urban areas, we will start a campaign to bring farmers and their families into the cities to work at these industrial sites. By subsidizing housing and coordinating with industry leaders, we will make it very appealing to relocate."

HEL_chop_down_the_forests:0 "Chop Down the Forests"
HEL_chop_down_the_forests_desc:0 "In an age of steel, iron, and oil there is often the griffon who forgets the importance of the humble tree. We will need the additional timber for new houses, papermills, and other industries that require vast quantities of wood. In addition, clearing out some of the forests will make room for new factories and infrastructure."

HEL_new_taxes:0 "Taxes, Taxes, Taxes"
HEL_new_taxes_desc:0 "A five percent income tax on our poorest griffon and our richest griffon is widely different a sum of idols. Squeezing every idol out of our poor makes little sense, a comprehensive tax reform that shifts based upon annual income shall be a fair way forward. There might be some grumbling from our wealthiest citizens, but a fair tax is better than another socialist revolt."

HEL_literacy_for_all:0 "Open the Trade Schools"
HEL_literacy_for_all_desc:0 "As we expand industry we will also need an educated population to meet the positions that will inevitably open up overtime. Engineers to craft new machines, scientists to develop new medicine, and bankers to figure out how to sell it all. It is with this foresight that we further invest in our public education, so that the best and brightest can turn a profit in the future."

HEL_bring_adelart_into_the_modern_age:0 "Backwater No Longer"
HEL_bring_adelart_into_the_modern_age_desc:0 "One only has to look out a window to see the fruits of our labors. Cars roll down paved roads and street lights cut through the darkness. The hum of industry is heard all hours of the day, the oil fields of Lissay flow with black gold, and the banks are overflowing with Idols. We have entered into the modern age with the means to enjoy it."

HEL_oil_foreign_policy:0 "The Third Aquileian Republic"
HEL_oil_foreign_policy_desc:0 "With the second republic now a clawnote in history, the time has come for a new griffon to preside over eastern Griffonia. Not by a monarch or a president, but an investor and a chairgriff instead. The dying embers of their republic shall be stoked and burn bright once more, albeit with a particular economic twist."

HEL_oil_attack_greifwald:0 "Put An End to the Monarchies"
HEL_oil_attack_greifwald_desc:0 "Despite our veiled intentions with this republican project, it is important that we maintain some semblance of ideological consistency for the sake of our national legitimacy. The remnants of the old ways have to go, even if it means we have to reorient our current trade policies to not see a dent in our bottom line."

HEL_drive_out_the_bandits:0 "Tanks Through the Forests"
HEL_drive_out_the_bandits_desc:0 "To be frank, nogriff knows what’s going on in Griefwald. We dealt with them and made sure that we were the preeminent authority in the region, even borrowing their name for a little while; but in the end very few creatures actually made investments there and truly cleaned up the place. It’s high time we cleaned out those forests for good."

HEL_oil_oil_and_more_oil:0 "Oil, Oil, and More Oil!"
HEL_oil_oil_and_more_oil_desc:0 "The great thing about oil is that everyone wants it, and that we’re the ones who can give it to them; for a price of course. With his claws already deep in the petrochemical industry, it’s only fitting that de Conard expands his operations as much as is feasible. Who doesn’t just love a good monopoly?"

HEL_open_up_the_markets:0 "Through Markets, Opportunity"
HEL_open_up_the_markets_desc:0 "In theory, anyone can climb the social ladder in [HEL.GetNameDef]. True to this ideal, a burgeoning economic meritocracy that encourages innovative thinking and tough decisions will weed out any severe cases of nepotism and general idiocy. So it is in economics, so it shall be in wider Aquileian society."

HEL_the_preemptive_strike:0 "The Preemptive Strike"
HEL_the_preemptive_strike_desc:0 "Pomovarra is everything we claim to be, yet are not. Their social democracy is a threat to our facade, however thick the veil we use may be. They will need to be dealt with. Market competitors are one thing, but an ideological threat that undermines the legitimacy of our establishments? Well, that simply won't do."

HEL_full_alliance_with_flowena:0 "The Pacte Économique du Griffonia Central"
HEL_full_alliance_with_flowena_desc:0 "Whilst international economic agreements rarely extend so far as to warrant military cooperation, there are situations in which financial interests coincide with defensive ones. For us, cooperation - both military and economic - means more capital for the top; so why not make some friends? Money makes for wealthy bedfellows, after all."

HEL_a_republic_in_avian:0 "A Republic in Avian"
HEL_a_republic_in_avian_desc:0 "Much like the Périphérie, Avian is a hotbed of violence and is - to be blunt - an economic black hole in every respect. The region may be marginally more developed than Adelart once was, but it is no less chaotic. The republic - true to its moral duties in ensuring peace and stability - shall make a significant military investment in the region."

HEL_FLO_faction:0 "Central Griffonian Economic Pact"

HEL_crush_our_competitors:0 "Cut Our Competitors Down to Size"
HEL_crush_our_competitors_desc:0 "Skyfall is the home of the very worst of our breed. They may be economically prosperous and they may be politically savvy, but they make no secret of either. Not only do they threaten our financial existence, but their open approach to the way their state is run has led to many griffs questioning our finances and de Conard’s personal wealth. Their end is nigh."

HEL_drink_to_the_fall_of_the_trade_princes:0 "A Toast to the New Griffs in Town"
HEL_drink_to_the_fall_of_the_trade_princes_desc:0 "There are few things worth celebrating with a needlessly expensive dinner party, but we’ve really done something special here haven’t we? From a backwater state in a chaotic part of Griffonia to the most prosperous - and profitable - country on the continent. We’ve earned a little self-indulgence, wouldn’t you say?"

HEL_integrate_greifwalder_institutions:0 "The Pan-Aquileian Parliament"
HEL_integrate_greifwalder_institutions_desc:0 "Parliaments are typically responsible for lawmaking and the general day-to-day running of government affairs and ours shall be no different. With lobbying, a little media manipulation and a careful sprinkling of fake hyperpartisanship, there will be no better place for up-and-coming entrepreneurs to get stuck in."

HEL_align_republic:0 "The True Aquileian Republic"
HEL_align_republic_desc:0 "The previous attempts at republican revolution were marred and eventually entirely halted by their aggressive anti-monarchy tendencies. Whilst we recognise the ideological convictions of the past, it is far more important in modern times to maintain friendly relations with all nations willing to speak with us. War is costly and dangerous, we don’t want to risk any of that."

adelart.1.t:0 "Twenty Days of Celebration"
adelart.1.d:0 "#TODO, Adelart celebrates twenty years of freedom from greifwald, and Merlock Wood calls the people and peasants of Adelart to the capital, Bergelun, for 20 days of festivities - but also government policy. Through a system of communal representation and popular assembly (think, perhaps, a primitive version of the anarchist Nabat, or the Regional Congress of Peasants, Workers and Insurgents, in Makhno's Ukraine, but with the flavor of merry griffons instead of dreary anarchists), everyone in Adelart will be allowed to have their say and determine the nation's future - tension for the war with Greifwald, though, lies thick in the air."
adelart.1.a:0 "Times have changed in Adelart, but we merry griffs endure."

adelart.2.t:0 "Twenty Hours of Argument"
adelart.2.d:0 "#TODO, The first argument among communal delegations emerges, as those coming to Bergelun on behalf of the Old Believers and the Prelate feud with PAT exiles from Aquileia and other such vanguardists and idealistic revolutionaries under the command of Alexandra Descieux. Wood, understanding either faction would give him the power to pass orders against the other, decides to assemble the delegates together for a moeeting - and fast."
adelart.2.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?!?!?"

adelart.3.t:0 "Descieux's Polemic"
adelart.3.d:0 "#TODO, Alexandra Descieux herself, the firebrand young Aquileian revolutionary, goes to see Merlock, along with a score of her bodyguards. The discussion is decidely more hostile, with Descieux accusing Merlock and his followers of being upjumped bandits collaborating with capitalists and the church to build a movement that bears no resemblance to socialism - she demands centralization into a workers republic after the war with greifwald and an end to bandits and merc groups participating in the congresses, along with other socialist demands like actual collectivisation, etc."
adelart.3.a:0 "Promise proper centralisation will begin soon."
adelart.3.b:0 "Promise a socialist philosophy while maintaining Wood's own primacy."
adelart.3.c:0 "Decline Descieux's request - our free territory must endure!"

adelart.4.t:0 "The Prelate's Confession"
adelart.4.d:0 "#TODO, Instead of hot-tempered old believer militias and zealots, it is instead the ancient prelate Luca that goes to see Merlock. They reconnect, and the Prelate reveals concerns about the "Going to the Griffons" movement, where PAT operatives are attempting to stir anti-clerical and pro-communist dissent (based on the Going to the People movement irl) - he believes this is counter to the democratic processes they have built and the self-determination of the temples"
adelart.4.a:0 "Order the exiles to suspend operations in rural territories."
adelart.4.b:0 "Permit PAT propaganda, but ban anti-clerical operations."
adelart.4.c:0 "Decline the Prelate's request - the temple is not without scrutiny!"

adelart.5.t:0 "An Unexpected Petitioner"
adelart.5.d:0 "#TODO, Jaume de Conard, the slimy, handsome, devilish industrialist himself, goes and meets Merlock Wood at the dying stages of the congress. He critiques both the church and the communists and says Wood that he will gladly faciliate a true democratic transition and arrange international legitimacy for the Forest Brothers - with a few deals from his good friends in Flowena. Claiming to hold a large amount of money and stores, he offers to build up industry with flowenan loans and part of his own money and that of the reform faction - as long as a republic arrives... and Flowena is paid from Wood's own coffers."
adelart.5.a:0 "We need the money... and the arms!"
adelart.5.b:0 "Order the Bëschbridder to escort him out."

adelart.6.t:0 "The Rights of Petition"
adelart.6.d:0 "#TODO, Set after adelart.2 and before adelart.4 and adelart.5: All delegations, regardless if they are merc or revolutionary, bandit or peasant leader, religious or reformist, can submit proposals to be considered to Adelart's makeshift decentralized congress (more of a "what wood and the prelate say we will agree to") - in the past this was quite nice and refreshing, but now, the mood of the congress has diminished and the delegates are squabbling amongst themselves more and more. Merlock is exasperated, he's out of his depth as no longer just a unifying bandit leader, and the prelate is now screaming at him instead of by his side - now, here come all the petitions..."
adelart.6.a:0 "Send them all in..."

adelart.7.t:0 "Partisan Divisions Disbanded"
adelart.7.d:0 "#TODO, Aquileian exiles and other such communist rabble-rousers who are attempting to place themselves on the same level as Wood and his bandit armies have their divisions disbanded - they will either integrate into Wood and the good Prelate's chain of command or go back to their ruined homes in Aquileia!"
adelart.7.a:0 "Adelart submits to no power, no ideology, no master!"

adelart.8.t:0 "What to Do With So Much Gold?"
adelart.8.d:0 "#TODO, What to do with petrodollars that we got from selling our soul to the Flowenans?"
adelart.8.a:0 "Spend the money on salvaging our trade reputation!"
adelart.8.b:0 "Spend the money on mobilisation - Greifwald lurks!"
adelart.8.c:0 "To Tartarus with the economy, we need loyalty and griffons!"

adelart.9.t:0 "Flowenan Businesses Occupy Lissay Oil Fields"
adelart.9.d:0 "#TODO, oops! too much banking dependence means you lose resource rights in Lissay... whispers of coup as well"
adelart.9.a:0 "Hey, those were... ours..."

adelart.10.t:0 "le Shérif de Nottemagne"
adelart.10.d:0 "#TODO, the Sheriff passes the border from exile in Greifwald and announces his official return, rallying what remains of his supporters to his side and promising all good free griffs that he will pardon them for revolutionary activity so long as they join his band - assemblies and councils are frightened - wood and forest brothers need to take action"
adelart.10.a:0 "Well, we didn't take all those loans for nothing..." #(We will ask the flowenans for help)
adelart.10.b:0 "Raise popular militias, the griffons stand with Wood!" #(Militia time :sunglasses:)
adelart.10.c:0 "The old bandit companies will drive them back once more!" #(20 years later, grizzled bandits return to fight a second sheriff)
adelart.10.e:0 "Descieux's partisans shall prove their loyalty!" #(Send the commie emigres from Aquileia to help)
adelart.10.f:0 "Time for the prelate to rev up his tractors!" #(Go go sisters of Eyr!)

# A note - adelart.11 to adelart.14 are mutually exclusive "ending" focuses to the opening tree, so they have some similar parallels -> all come before the war with greifwald and the final action against the sheriff

adelart.11.t:0 "A Revolutionary Bulwark"
adelart.11.d:0 "#TODO, urged on by the partisans and the other radical socialist groups currently housed in Adelart, Wood and the assemblies, local councils, and autonomous temples are faced with only one option - lock down the country, prepare for the final fight with the Greifwald reactionaries, and institute an emergency state of siege"
adelart.11.a:0 "It is not just Adelart at stake, but the future of Griffonia."

adelart.12.t:0 "One for All and All for One"
adelart.12.d:0 "Merlock walked between the bandits, one by one. His bandits. His fighters. His revolutionaries. Each got a wink, a clawshake and a word as he passed.\n\n"Abigail, glad to see your eye's healed up. Any new tricks to show me?"\n"Yolanda, cannons haven't gotcha deaf yet? Good griff."\n"Claudius! Never got the chance to congratulate ya for that raid on Falcontown, well, congrats!"\n"Jacques, glad you made it. Don't look a day over ninety, haha you old devil!"\n\nHe'd done this sort of thing many times, after a raid or whenever there was loot to pass around. But this time he'd gathered them all in secret, under an old tree.\n\n"Listen. I know you all saw me there, at the big assembly. Twenty years, eh? What'd ya think? No, I know what you'll say, you were great, I loved hearing you say that thing to those griffs. No. Don't lie to me. Be honest thieves and tell me what you thought."\n\n"It was embarrassing!" Jacques said after a pause, "That prelate walked all over you, and the nerve of that commie, coming before you and saying you couldn't govern. Twenty years ago, nogriff woulda dared!"\n\n"That's right!" Merlock howled, years of frustration finally coming out, "It's like they've all forgotten! We've forgotten! Look at us. If we'd led our revolt like we are now, the Greifwalders woulda walked all over us. And they will, if we don't shape up. Gods, I needed that. Yes! I don't know what we're doing anymore."\n\n"We'll show 'em!" shouted the half-deaf Yolanda, "The Greifwalders, the prelate, we'll show 'em all. They can talk all they want, but it's action the people respect. I'm gonna go back to my band and I'm gonna train 'em twice as hard. For you, chief. For us. All for one?"\n\n"One for all," finished Merlock. "Good. We're on the right track. I'll be gathering you here soon. We're gonna find that old sheriff and we're gonna show everygriff that we've still got it. For Adelart. For freedom. For us.""
adelart.12.a:0 "In fraternity united!"

adelart.13.t:0 "We Shall Stay as We Are"
adelart.13.d:0 "#TODO, Merlock stands before the congresess and does not formally commit to any faction, instead reaffirming the plularism inherent in the Adelartian system and the bonds that free griffs of all stripes have been able to forge in this lawless land - this would be the lead up to Switzerland after Greifwald is integrated"
adelart.13.a:0 "Adelart shall not fall again to tyranny's yoke!"

adelart.14.t:0 "The Gifts of Eyr"
adelart.14.d:0 "#TODO, Luca returns to Merlock's side as an equal, announces he's reviving political activity of the church and mobilizing the Old Believers against the threat of Greifwald - his good old wise, kindly, and almost slightly-insane about his religious visions nature, is assuring to Wood and well, the people love their prelate more than anything."

adelart.17.b:0 ""I sense an opportunity...""

adelart.20.t:0 "Black Nights and Black Gold"
adelart.20.d:0 "#TODO, Jaume's plan succeeds, Flowenan mercenaries and militias loyal to the republican plan overrun the city, Jaume is appointed some form of provisional leader of the Adelartian communities and his cronies fill the voids of the arrested officials - old believers, Wood, Descieux, and the rest of the revolutionary brigades"
adelart.20.a:0 "Long live profit... er, the Republic!"

adelart.21.t:0 "A Republic, If We Can Keep It"
adelart.21.d:0 "#TODO - Jaume de Conard, realizing the Flowenan mercenaries having routed the Sheriff, comes to Wood and the councils and offers them a deal - seeing as the only options if this continues are either a bloody struggle for the defense of Eagleton or a full corporate takeover, why don't we just accept some of their demands and reform into a democracy... of course, with myself as provisional president"

adelart.19.d_rip_sheriff:0 "The day was peaceful, and the forest birds sang as the sun rose on the law's victory. The Sherif of Adelart sat content. Thumbing through some paperwork, he saw reports of Woodists all across the land being culled by this restoration. The violent tendencies of revolutionaries would be wiped away, and peace would come to the forests. Now began the work of administration, and all shall return to as it was before that Anarchist Wood ever tainted this land.\n\nThen, a knock came upon the Sheriff's door. Putting down his quill and parchment, Nottemagne opened the door. A nervous page sat waiting for him outside the door, "Sherif, sir, you have a priest here to see you." he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "But it's not just that..."\n\nNottemagne laughed and pushed the page to the side, "Ah, yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, "And I am sure whatever surprise they have waiting for me will surely be a great one!" The Sherif was happy. He had always been faithful to Boreas above, removing the godless communists and doing his service to the rightful prelate of Greifwald. Now all his hard work was coming back to repay him.\n\nMoving down the hallways of his office in Eagleton, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way, he noticed most of the usual staff did not seem to be there. It must be Saturday he presumed, and moved along. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside, a rhythmic droning that rattled his skull and shook his mind. Pushing through, he exited the building and suddenly stopped, digging his talons into the floor, he tried to stammer out words but could not. In front of him stood rows and rows of griffons in the robes of peasants and religious orders lined up with various relics and tomes in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the Archons in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most frightening of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon the most, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power and your life! The true believers shall have a home once more in these sacred forests! For Boreas, who leads us, Eyr, who feeds us, and Arcturus, who sends you to damnation!"\n\nWith this, the Sherif felt a sharpness on his back. Turning around, he saw Sister Selena, leader of the sisters of Eyr, with a blade on the back of his neck. "By the will of the gods, you are dethroned Sherif."\n\n"Because Eyr has come to Adelart.""

## Socialists in the Confederation

adelart.29.t:0 "Back to Aquileia"
adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called “Vanguardists” cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as “betrayal of the socialist ideal” and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."
adelart.29.a:0 "A commendable move."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and the rare government minister who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs,at one point in history asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

adelart_flavor.2.t:0 "Fichtl's Festival"
adelart_flavor.2.d:0 "Controversy has emerged in a small forest town outside Herlein on the Greifenmarscher border, where an investigation over sounds of disturbing melodies and perpetual revelery led to the uncovering of a bizarre pacifist and envionmentalist religious sect that has taken to worshipping a griffonian forest deity, Fichtl. Worship of the forest deity, questioned revelers claim, was a centuries old tradition among the isolated peasants, which many claim predated the establishment of the Trinitarian faith all together. Effigies of Fichtl, a tree with a Griffonian face upon it, have been found all across the forest towns, hand-crafted, woven, and stuffed by local artisans, while local bards sing the songs of the faith to adoring crowds.\n\nOutraged Old Believer authorities have labeled the movement heresy and idolatry, and a local priest noted that the effigies of the god were "unsettling to the point where I thought a Maarite spirit had brought such disgust and rancor upon my soul". The local council leader claims that the festivals were all "in good fun" and that mobs of Old Believer followers were making a fuss over a centuries-old tradition. Fichtlites interviewed merely claimed the festivals were a way to "appreciate the bounty of Fichtl and call attention to the lovely environment we all share, and which is being destroyed by the march of industry", and that the childish effigies were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nWith the Old Believers and community leaders at odds, it falls to [ROOT.GetLeader] to determine the fate of this obscure festival. The question is - could these festivals be merely be cover stories for heresy?"

adelart_news.1.t:0 "A Prophet Rises"
adelart_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Disturbing news has come out of the Aquileian periphery. An old, ragged priest of the Griffonian goddess Eyr by the name of Luca vun Lissay, backed by thousands of his faithful followers, often wielding nothing but clubs, swords, axes, and the rags on their back, has seized control of the Trade Federation of Skyfall. Appointing himself Venia III, rightful Archon of Eyr, Luca has made calls to the global community to stand against the decadence of the Archons and their imperial masters, rallying behind the banner of the true Archon of Eyr to bring a new religious awakening of community, faith, and temperance. Striving for "a reformation of the Griffonian faith", the Prophet of Eyr, as his supporters call him, has developed a dangerous movement - one that might see more and more griffons come under its sway."

merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean de Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the church, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
luca_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Luca vun Lissay, leader of the Old Believers in Adelart and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place.

However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power.

Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

sheriff_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of November, 951 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: No one is quite sure how the Sheriff of Adelart is still alive, with all the vitriol and hatred levied against him, nor how he has continued to be a sizable thorn in the side of the Adelartian government. 20 years ago, Jean de Nottemagne pursued the bandit Merlock Wood and his allies in the Old Believer faith, raiding towns, demanding taxes and levies from peasants who might have hoarded him and his rebel allies. Now, however, the tables have turned. Merlock Wood is the leader of a free territory for griffons of all stripes, while Nottemagne has been forced from town to town with a small army of loyal griffs and armed tax collectors.\n\nNottemagne, however, has emulated Wood's elusive spirit, and is never found at the same town twice. While mercenaries and Forest Brothers alike pursue him, the Sheriff of Adelart always stays one step ahead, raiding villages for taxes to fill his war chest and griffons to join his roving army. When Forest Brothers catch him, the Sheriff's forces fight like rabid beasts, the Sheriff front and center at the vanguard. He may have lost an eye and all of his dignity in the guerilla war against his former domain, but his perserverance has not wavered.\n\nAdelart will be cleansed from banditry, and the Sheriff will regain his rightful seat!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"
