 cat_race_desc:0 "Bipedal by nature, these feline creatures have developed differently from their more feral kin and have grown sapient as a result. Abyssinian cats are renowned for their wit and penchant for trading; however, their historical institution of the enslavement of non-cat creatures has sullied their reputation abroad, and they are seen as lazy two-faced schemers. Like other cats, they are obligate carnivores and tend to avoid sweet food and milk."
