 cat_folder:0 "Abyssinian Technologies"
 cat_folder_desc:0 "Magical technologies and improvements specific to the Abyssinian race."
 cat_race:0 "Abyssinian Race"
 cat_race_desc:0 "Bipedal by nature, these feline creatures have developed differently from their more feral kin and have grown sapient as a result. Abyssinian cats are renowned for their wit and penchant for trading; however, their historical institution of the enslavement of non-cat creatures has sullied their reputation abroad, and they are seen as lazy two-faced schemers. Like other cats, they are obligate carnivores and tend to avoid sweet food and milk."
 
 tech_cat_biology1:0 "Natural Night Vision"
 tech_cat_biology1_desc:0 "Felines are more than capable of seeing in the dark thanks to their large pupils and a layer of tissue known as tapetum lucidum. This natural ability should be taken into account in the military with an increased focus on operations conducted during the night."
 tech_cat_biology2:0 "The Righting Reflex"
 tech_cat_biology2_desc:0 "When falling from a high place, cats reflexively twist and turn their body to ensure they land on their paws. While this does not mean cats are capable of surviving falls from any height, it does reduce chance of injury greatly, and makes traversal of terrain easier. Military planners should note this ability in their plans."
 tech_cat_biology3:0 "Expert Climbers"
 tech_cat_biology3_desc:0 "Like all cats, Abyssinians are adept at climbing and fond of heights. Not only that, but they have adapted to the rough terrain of the Abyssinian peninsula and can traverse rocky lands with relative ease. This means military commanders should not see difficult terrain as an obstacle, but rather, as an opportunity."
 tech_cat_biology4:0 "Fierce Fighters"
 tech_cat_biology4_desc:0 "With their sharp claws, fangs and quick reflexes, cats excel at close quarters combat. Infantry commanders should not hesitate to exploit any opportunity to reach the enemy in melee range."
 tech_cat_biology5:0 "Hunting The Prey"
 tech_cat_biology5_desc:0 "While many civilized cats have abandoned hunting in favour of agriculture and keeping livestock, they still retain the primordial instincts of ambush predators. While hunting enemy soldiers is much harder than hunting animals, similar ambush tactics can still prove to be useful against them."
 tech_cat_biology6:0 "Refined Senses"
 tech_cat_biology6_desc:0 "Military leaders should not forget to take advantage of all the sharpened senses of their Abyssinian soldiers besides the obvious ones like night vision. They have well developed senses of smell and hearing and can even detect changes in atmospheric pressure that accompany changing weather. Some scientists have even proposed utilizing ultrasound communications in battle, which enemies would be unable to hear."
 
 tech_cat_highlanders1:0 "Highlanders"
 tech_cat_highlanders1_desc:0 "Much of the Abyssinian population resides in the highlands. Rough terrain combined with periodic conflict between regional nobles means that many cats have experience in mountain combat. These highlanders are excellent recruits for any potential mountaineer brigades."
 tech_cat_highlanders2:0 "There Can Be Only One!"
 tech_cat_highlanders2_desc:0 "The Abyssinian highlands are known for their culture of honor and duelling. Annual tournaments are held where the most experienced warriors participate. The tournament continues until one cat remains standing, hence the highlander motto "There can be only one!". This culture helps to refine their fighting skills further, and encourages individual warriors to do their best."
 tech_cat_highlanders3:0 "Mountain Guns"
 tech_cat_highlanders3_desc:0 "Moving cannons in rough terrain is no easy task, but the highlanders are innovative folk. They have developed specialized artillery pieces that can be taken apart, packed and carried by pack animals, slaves or even cats themselves."
 tech_cat_highlanders4:0 "Anti-Armor Tactics"
 tech_cat_highlanders4_desc:0 "Modern armoured vehicles already have a hard time in rough terrain. Highlanders seek to exploit this weakness and have proposed new tactics to counter mechanized opponents. These tactics rely on ambushes and rear-area attacks to strike vulnerable vehicle columns in the mountains."
