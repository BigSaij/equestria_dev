 cat_race:0 "Abyssinian Race"
 cat_race_desc:0 "Bipedal by nature, these feline creatures have developed differently from their more feral kin and have grown sapient as a result. Abyssinian cats are renowned for their wit and penchant for trading; however, their historical institution of the enslavement of non-cat creatures has sullied their reputation abroad, and they are seen as lazy two-faced schemers. Like other cats, they are obligate carnivores and tend to avoid sweet food and milk."
 
 tech_cat_biology1:0 "Natural Night Vision"
 tech_cat_biology1_desc:0 "Felines are more than capable of seeing in the dark thanks to their large pupils and a layer of tissue known as tapetum lucidum. This natural ability should be taken into account in the military with an increased focus on operations conducted during the night."
 tech_cat_biology2:0 "The Righting Reflex"
 tech_cat_biology2_desc:0 "When falling from a high place, cats reflexively twist and turn their body to ensure they land on their paws. While this does not mean cats are capable of surviving falls from any height, it does reduce chance of injury greatly, and makes traversal of terrain easier. Military planners should note this ability in their plans."
 tech_cat_biology3:0 "Expert Climbers"
 tech_cat_biology3_desc:0 "Like all cats, Abyssinians are adept at climbing and fond of heights. Not only that, but they have adapted to the rough terrain of the Abyssinian peninsula and can traverse rocky lands with relative ease. This means military commanders should not see difficult terrain as an obstacle, but rather, as an opportunity."
