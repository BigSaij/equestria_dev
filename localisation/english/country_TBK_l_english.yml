### Starting Tree ###
 
TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art of the Deal"
TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."
 
TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade of Democracy"
TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."
 
TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing the Wheel of Democracy"
TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."

TBK_convincing_legislature: "Pass the Home Act"
TBK_convincing_legislature_desc: "The republic is nothing if not cooperative, especially regarding the Zarantians. It’s only fair, and practical of course, to allow for the free movement of peoples over the Tobuckian-Zarantian border; with a little luck, this should keep the tribes off of our backs for a while longer too."

TBK_expand_republican_guard: "Expand Guard Jurisdiction"
TBK_expand_republican_guard_desc: "If the events of the past few months have proven anything, it’s that we must allow the national guard jurisdiction over the movement of peoples. We must keep the Zarantian intellectuals in the city, and of course make sure that the warlords remain blissfully ignorant for a little longer."

TBK_nascent_bureaucracy: "Clean the House"
TBK_nascent_bureaucracy_desc: "The time has come to tidy up around the edges and make doubly sure that nothing compromising leaks out about our little game. It might increase the workload for the state bureaucrats that are trustworthy just a little, but that’s a horseshoe they’ll simply have to wear. Sometimes a little encouragement is unfortunately necessary."

TBK_hope_tobuck: "Three Hurrahs For Tobuck"
TBK_hope_tobuck_desc: "A little glimmer of hope, no matter how far-off the end goal is or how misplaced that hope may be, is still something that can be utilized for the benefit of our little operation. The people must believe in the republic to make the most of the state structure it provides and so they shall, however briefly."

TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "The Loveable Drunk"
TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy." 

TBK_parlay_vasile: "Erstwhile Partner"
TBK_parlay_vasile_desc: "Ah, Vasile; a griffon as capable of holding a genuine conversation with someone as he is with robbing any poor creature blind on the spot. We would do well to reaffirm our ties with him as he has other plans for this city, though he knows little of it. Perhaps he may even help us unknowingly!"

TBK_zarantia_peace_speech: "Peace and Prosperity"
TBK_zarantia_peace_speech_desc: "Giggle Juice recently came to us with an idea for giving a speech on coexistence and cooperation with the Zarantians, even suggesting that we invite their tribal leader if she’s interested. Let us arrange for this plan of his to forward; even if our neighbours don’t accept, our people will appreciate the gesture."

TBK_early_pay_day: "Their Pay Day"
TBK_early_pay_day_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."

TBK_our_pay_day: "Our Pay Day"
TBK_our_pay_day_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."

TBK_thanks_for_bits: "Goodbye, And Thanks For the Bits"
TBK_thanks_for_bits_desc: "We’ve finished up earlier than expected, much to the imminent delight of that tribal queen. Well, better be off whilst the going’s good as they say; there’s no point in delaying our stay in Tobuck any further than necessary. The climate was far from enjoyable and the politics will not be missed."

TBK_pr_campaign: "To The Citizens of Tobuck!"
TBK_pr_campaign_desc: "There are few things more effective than propaganda these days, but we prefer to call that sort of project a ‘media campaign’ when we take it to the public. Whatever the case, calming the people and the soldiers in the warlord armies is a logical step in ensuring the stability of the state for the moment."

TBK_please_listen: "Do Not Believe Their Lies!"
TBK_please_listen_desc: "It seems that our previous efforts, though extensive, simply weren’t enough to sufficiently quell popular discontent and the army remains sceptical. We’ll simply have to make their other sources of information entirely invalid then! We’ll make sure that they don’t trust anypony but us when it comes to the media!"

TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."

TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking the Supply"
TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "Given how messy things currently are in the weapon-selling department, we would do well to streamline the process somewhat. With a little estimation on our part, a few approximations from the warehouse workers and a healthy dose of paperwork it should become much easier to maintain and utilise the stores."

TBK_quality_products: "Quality Products"
TBK_quality_products_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. On the other hoof, certain firearms are precisely hunted for their qualities, whenever exceptional or historical. It'd be a waste to sell them off to a common buyer and leave a wealthy patron miffed."

TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"
TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why it's leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!" 

TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."
 
TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."

TBK_streamlined_procurement: "Streamlined Procurement"
TBK_streamlined_procurement_desc: "To be blunt, we need to speed things up a little. What we have in place works, but it doesn’t work nearly well enough to last. Though it will pain the coffers to do so, it’s important that we increase the number of working personnel on the weapon stockpiles and begin properly managing the warehouses that we keep them in."

TBK_eye_on_warlords: "The Three Warlords"
TBK_eye_on_warlords_desc: "Though the warlords guarantee our safety from outside forces, they also present the most significant security threat. If they were to discover the deal then they would quickly become hostile and would certainly have the military capacity to take over for themselves. We must watch our backs, wait and play along."

TBK_celebrate_military_success: "Celebrate Military Success"
TBK_celebrate_military_success_desc: "As Wallnut Drive would say, there’s nothing like a party to remind yourself why it is that you do what you do. Though they haven’t done much recently, the warlords would very much enjoy some shipments of various foodstuffs and booze to keep themselves occupied until we’re ready to get out."

TBK_rules_gun_running: "The Rules of Good Business"
TBK_rules_gun_running_desc: "When it comes to gun running there are some things you should always do and others that would probably get you killed if you were to have a go at them. These rules must be followed to a tee, unless we plan on ending up ousted like the Zarantians. If nothing else, the threat of retrospective irony is simply too great."

TBK_first_rule: "First Rule"
TBK_first_rule_desc: "First rule is to never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range. Wallnut Drive is a true oddball compared to the other warlords, someone who seems to find new ways to break guns and expend ammunition."

TBK_tricky_thestral: "The Tricky Thestral"
TBK_tricky_thestral_desc: "Wallnut Drive is not the smartest bat, but he has a way of showing up just when you don't need him to. If given the right incentives, he'll cause enough chaos and confusion on his own that the others won't realize the game until it's already up."

TBK_second_rule: "Second Rule"
TBK_second_rule_desc: "Second rule is to never pick up arms with your customers. Baragzen, the snobby Warzenan noble, has far greater ambitions than any other warlord in Tobuck, only outmatched by his boorish smugness. But passion like his, if harnessed well, makes for a good tool."

TBK_exiled_royal: "The Exiled Royal"
TBK_exiled_royal_desc: "Baragzen sees Tobuck as just a stepping stone to future conquests. Let him think that way. We'll give him some extra guns and tell him the other warlords are looking to muscle in on his territory, and he'll keep them off our backs."

TBK_third_rule: "Third Rule"
TBK_third_rule_desc: "Third rule is to always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it. Alesia Snezhnaya is a smart mare and careful with her goods. But give her a good deal and she'll make a good business partner."

TBK_white_severyana: "The White Severyanian"
TBK_white_severyana_desc: "Alesia Snezhnaya is dogged and determined, but thinks linearly. If we hoof her some extra troops and tell her to fortify the border, she'll be too busy scrupulously digging trenches to snoop around."

TBK_failure_operation: "Erstwhile Operation"
TBK_failure_operation_desc: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, so the media says at least. The warlords have been encouraged to launch an operation against Chiropterra, working off of entirely falsified reports of a weak border presence there. Knowing their drive for loot, they’ll likely commit fully to the attack and need to reoperate afterwards."

TBK_provoke_battles: "Tobuckian Standoff"
TBK_provoke_battles_desc: "We’re in a position now where we can encourage the warlords to fight one another, if only to give us a little more time. Pea has dirt on all three of the big equines that should be just enough to get them into a scuffle, we’ll just have to make sure that they don’t start sniffing around once the damage is done."

### Vasile tree

TBK_vasile_start: "To Save the Republic"
TBK_vasile_start_desc: "Well that was a mess. Pea's off. Zarantia's angrier than they ever have been and the warlords are running amok in the countryside. But while you can see some smugglers running to the ships in Tobuck's harbour, there is a griff in the presidential palace who still sees an opportunity. After all, who better to thrive in chaos than a Brodfeldian?"

TBK_take_loans: "Grovel For Loans"
TBK_take_loans_desc: "Pea drained the whole treasury dry to fund his escape. Whatever he made it out with is gone and so is the rest. At this point, we'll have to bite the bullet and borrow at loan shark rates but it beats austerity. Nothing is more unstable than corrupt civil servants getting told to make do with less."

TBK_crash_cuts: "Crash Cuts"
TBK_crash_cuts_desc: "Whoever said that you have to spend money to make money was not in the gun running business. While you can haggle with some ponies, you can't expect to go far with the loan shark breathing down your neck. Anyway, everypony takes a squeeze and be a little patient. If you want guarantees and security, go plant potatoes!"

TBK_support_zarantian_businesses: "Entice the Zarantians"
TBK_support_zarantian_businesses_desc: "Throughout Pea's regime, we took very little care in giving a reason for the Zarantian-aligned families not to hate us. Considering Pea's end game, it was no surprise but Vasile had nonetheless made some business overtures. By reaching out, we could build a relationship off of that. And once we're in, we can work things out."

TBK_blame_pea: "Everything Is Pea's Fault!"
TBK_blame_pea_desc: "Pea Shooter was a fantastic gun smuggler but he really mucked it up for the rest of us. We'll be lucky if we manage to really turn things around. Luckily, the Tobuckians feel the same way. So we might as well pin everything on him. He's far away and not planning to come back. He'll understand. Probably."

TBK_blame_giggle: "And Giggle's Too!"
TBK_blame_giggle_desc: "Giggle Juice was an amazing tool for a while when Pea's crew was still getting money and some good partying was enough to smooth the edges. But now, we're going to go through a rough patch and nothing gets on the nerves of everypony than a drunk who can't get up before noon. Time to sober up."

TBK_vasile_president: "Emergency Elections"
TBK_vasile_president_desc: "For all of its short history, the Republic of Tobuck never made good on its promise of organising elections. So let's. We'll have to be quick about it so no opposition can organise. Also, we'll need to raid the pantries to buy votes with something else than money. Hey you! Want a pound of flour in exchange for a vote?"

TBK_restore_legitimacy: "Bring Back Stability"
TBK_restore_legitimacy_desc: "For a little while, we have been able to keep the rowdiest elements of our mercenaries and smugglers in check. Now, they're running wild and anypony turning to the state needs to pay up to even get listened to. It's time to bring back some order and show them that maybe there's hope under the striped flag. At the very least, it'll buy us time to figure things out."

TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard: "Arm the Republican Guard"
TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard_desc: "The Republic Guard has never been much more than a ponyguard force dedicated to prevent the warlords from bullying the capital itself. It is time to give them the tools to do more and actually stand up to the warlords when the time is right. We have the guns. Time to give them to the right ponies this time around."

TBK_keep_some_servants: "Keep Some Bureaucrats"
TBK_keep_some_servants_desc: "Vasile and Pea paid a whole lot of ponies throughout their partnership. Sadly, both indulged in some favoritism, especially when Pea's plan became clear. The people wants corrupt heads to fall. Might as well give them what they want with Pea's loyalists and make sure we get to keep the loyal ones who know what they're doing."

TBK_cull_civil_servants: "Sweep the Slate Clean"
TBK_cull_civil_servants_desc: "For all its usefulness for our business venture, the corrupt apparel of state was a really nothing more than a temporary boon. It's a rotten base for anything long-term. We need to remove all of the corrupt civil servants and make sure those with real inside knowledge shut up permanently. Plus, this will be a wonderful opportunity to garner good among the people."

TBK_fight_warlords: "Act Swiftly and Fiercely"
TBK_fight_warlords_desc: "It's been months now that the three idiots and other new wannabe idiots have been ducking it out in the countryside to be in a prime position to take Tobuck. In a way, they made our job for us. Time to go out and mop them up before the bats or Zarantians get the idea of doing it first. Citizens, to arms! Or something like that. We're learning."

TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech: "Father of the Fatherland"
TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech_desc: "The votes have been counted and the elected parliament of Tobuck can finally gather. Thanks to our diligence, it's only a formality and Vasile Cel Tradat shall be confirmed as president of the Republic. It's time to address the people. Fear not, little foals of Tobuck. Vasile's here. And he'll take good care of you. We promise."

TBK_legimate_republic: "Republic of the People"
TBK_legimate_republic_desc: "You know what? If we are to make this republican thing work, we might as well walk the walk. Well. Up to a point. But still, we can find a way to make things work for the people and for us. In addition, it would finally allow us to make good on our plan to give us a presentable facade for the harmonic and established powers. After all, all facades are better with an actual building behind it."

But now, we'll have to provide for our own defense to fend off any attackers. Vasile has the will to do it. But how to go about it? That is the million bit question."

TBK_raise_extra_troops: "Call Upon the People"
TBK_raise_extra_troops_desc: "With the promise of a more respectable republic, we can start recruiting among the general population without fear of angering our military leaders. With a decent pay, we can even hope that enough will answer the call to fill up our ranks. It'll take time of course to build a standing army capable of defending Tobuck but it'll be ours. Plus, we know how to find enough guns to make even the lowest recruit a threat."

TBK_rally_front: "Together For Victory!"
TBK_rally_front_desc: "Gone are the days of the warlords and mercenaries. You won't be fighting so Pea Shooter can loot you for longer but for a square deal. Everypony gets their share. We're fighting for our homes and our families. This is Tobuck and it is not for sale! So gather around and grab a gun."

TBK_bat_forts: "The Western Trenches"
TBK_bat_forts_desc: "Chief among our threatening neighbours stands Chiropterra in the west. With Wallnut Drive's luck and tactics gone, we need to find new ways to counter them. Fortunately, we do have some veterans whose experience we can use. But considering the size of Tobuck, we have no other choice than to dig and entrench ourselves to start. Here's a shovel."

TBK_bat_defence: "Together Against the Bat Menace"
TBK_bat_defence_desc: "You know what's worse than smugglers, warlords and corruption? Bats. They're crazy, they're evil and they hate anything even remotely pleasurable.

Choose Tobuck."

TBK_hire_additional_mercs: "Hire the Band of Flayers"
TBK_hire_additional_mercs_desc: "We need forces loyal to the new republic in order to stabilize our still fragile rule, and to get the Chiropterrans off our backs. While we want to phase out the use of mercenaries and warlords eventually, we need to bring in some new muscle to keep the peace. The barbaric "Band of Flayers" and their fearsome reputation, including rumors of skinning victims, will be the perfect force to scare those fanatics off."

TBK_use_merc_experiences: "Utilize Mercenary Experiences"
TBK_use_merc_experiences_desc: "You know what's great about mercenaries? They know how to kill things. They'll tell you about it.

Now if only they would pick up after themselves."

TBK_criminal_republic: "Republic of Riches"

### Post-Chiropterra War Legimate tree

TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate: "Our Triumphant Republic"
TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate_desc: "It's over. The bats are in disarray and Vasile stands triumphant, our president-conqueror. In just a few years, we transformed a fake republic into a model for Zebrica, a profitable democracy, and now, we'll do it again for the fanatics! We're not the emotional type but it does bring a tear to your eye. Take that Kemerskai!"

TBK_bat_break_faith: "What Did Wallnut Say Again?"
TBK_bat_break_faith_desc: "From the beginning, we've had a window, if a bit of a foggy one, into how Chiropterra operates and what we've seen is not pretty. And that's us saying that so you catch the drift. If left alone, the madness will bite us in the tail. We need to neuter the Moonspeaker operation and make sure that from this day forward, they'll be shooting blanks even on a full moon!"

TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be: "Just... Leave Faith Be"
TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be_desc: "Look. They've been weird about it for a thousand years so maybe it's better that we just find a way to accommodate it all. Maybe teach them a few lessons about healthy management of expectations and pick up something like painting. We'll just make sure the Moonspeakers don't get too murderous. That'll be a start."

TBK_bat_peaceful: "Chill and Eat Mangoes"
TBK_bat_peaceful_desc: "Religion is obviously a root issue of why Chiropterra acted the way it did. However, we can't just ignore the result of a millennia of cultural stiffness. We need to sell to the bats the idea that there is more to life than war and moon, that they can just have fun. And we know a thing or two about how to sell something to a pony."

TBK_bat_moneys: "Tributes of the Moon"
TBK_bat_moneys_desc: "The Chiropterra war has been a costly endeavour and they've long caused untold sorrow and property damages. It's high time that they start paying reparations to those they've harmed. Well, to us for a start. Let's not upset the hierarchy of creditors. We don't forget our brave veterans or those who provided them with the tools of war."

TBK_bat_determine_guilt: "Guilty, Not Guilty..."
TBK_bat_determine_guilt_desc: "Throughout its history, Chiropterra has committed so much crime it's not even funny anymore. And that's just according to their archives. So if we want to make sure the angry victims are calmed down, we'll need to go through all of it and figure out who gets a bullet, a cell, a ticket to wherever or slapped with a fine and hoof so we can call it a day."

TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management: "Old System, New Management"
TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management_desc: "Look, Canterlot wasn't built in a day and we don't have a millenia on our hooves. We barely managed to build a republic once and that was without a cult to deal with. So we'll do the best thing a good leader can do: passing the buck! Er, I mean delegate to the right ponies and let them figure all that stuff out. They'll manage."

TBK_bat_democracy: "Traditional-Moon Party"
TBK_bat_democracy_desc: "Look, we know. But that one has been such a winning brand, we can't just go and not use it. In all honesty, the TMP has a nice ring to it and they need some reassurance that no, we're not trying to besiege the gates of the moon. Also, they're paying us anyway so we might as well give them a little something for all the royalties we're getting."

TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic: "New Lunar Republic"
TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic_desc: "President Vasile never meant to conquer and occupy foreign land, merely to liberate them and put an end to a criminal regime. Now, the new and improved Lunar Republic stands proud in Chiropterra, ready to engage with the world in good faith and absolutely no trace of terrorism. Ain't that swell? Why is there somepony wheezing in the back?"

TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy: "Vasile the Victorious"
TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy_desc: "As the sun rises over the dank Chiropterran hills, president Vasile stands alone and victorious and yet, some still have some doubts about him. Why? Hasn't he achieved the impossible? We have had so much success it's starting to get physically painful. Especially for our enemies. Poor them. So let's party. Lack of gratitude is best handled the morning after."

TBK_centralize_presidency: "One And Only President"
TBK_centralize_presidency_desc: "The road to our current success was a bumpy ones, with all kinds of needs to compromise, play nice and prove ourselves. Well, we've proven ourselves and it is high time that ponies stop pretending like president Vasile doesn't deserve his place. How about you all prove yourselves to him? What have you ever done for Tobuck?!"

TBK_who_saved_you: "Who Saved You?"
TBK_who_saved_you_desc: "We've spend so much time fighting for our lives that we have not really told the story of how it all went down. But in the end. Where was Tobuck when president Vasile took over? Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, torn apart by warlords and looted by a criminal. So ask yourselves, all the critics, how did we get here from there?"

TBK_who_made_you_wealthy: "Who Made You Rich?"
TBK_who_made_you_wealthy_desc: "It is true that Tobuck has always been well-developed but that wealth was always built on playing second fiddle for foreign rulers by families with little pride in their own people. So what did the Brodfeldian do? He did not export the wealth, he expanded it right here. He made Tobuck rich on its own terms and it's all trickling down back to you all."

TBK_sideline_harmonists: "What´s Good In Friendship?"
TBK_sideline_harmonists_desc: "What did the harmonists ever do for you? Did they feed you when you were hungry? Did they stand against Chiropterra when they loomed over us? Did they provide you with jobs? No. All they do is chatter and bicker about the right of law. Well, the law says Vasile Cel Tradat is the president of the republic and the law is right."

TBK_i_am_republic: "I Am the Republic"
TBK_i_am_republic_desc: "There, we said our piece and we're not hearing any retort. This concludes our national debate. So if you didn't pay attention, here's the main takeaway. This Republic rests upon the president's mighty shoulders and you all better be afraid of what would happen if Vasile Cel Tradat ever shrugged! Thanks for listening and get back to work."

TBK_symbols_presidency: "Idol of the Republic"
TBK_symbols_presidency_desc: "A great problem in Tobuck is that it never had a real story of its own, symbols or a mythology to explain why it is so great. In a way, it lacks a brand. And who better than president Vasile to be the face of it? So let's codify the presidency and elevate his game changing achievements. We'll call it all Vasilism. Sure rhymes with patriotism."

TBK_final_arbitrator: "Now You Sit and\n Listen To Me"
TBK_final_arbitrator_desc: "We've had to compromise way too much for too little gain during the early years of the presidency. We let the opposition in parliament and the media sling dirt at anypony. But in the end, it was our great president Vasile who lead us to victory and prosperity. So let's cut to the chase and listen. You all might learn a thing or two!"

TBK_supreme_protector: "Hear My Pledge"
TBK_supreme_protector_desc: "The candidate is chosen and Vasile's place in Tobuck's national myth is enshrined. So it may be time for the president to address the nation and to explain what his role is. That of a father, a father who knows that it's time for his little foals to spread their wings, to trot out of the nest and fly into the sunset. Ok, we'll keep working on that but the gist is there."

TBK_prime_minister_idea: "Perhaps I Work Too Much?"
TBK_prime_minister_idea_desc: "You know what? One can in fact suffer from success. There is something about open leadership that just drains you. Perhaps it's time to look for an heir. Well, at least a new face to throw at the press so the president can focus on the good thing in life : prestige, money and business. Preferably all at once."

TBK_perfect_servant: "My Most Loyal Aide"
TBK_perfect_servant_desc: "Vasile Cel Tradat has been a great president and achieved much. Nopony can deny that, especially not the one who wrote it all down. So who better to take the reins than his secretary? Bean Counter, the shy little pony who crunched the numbers for so many reforms. The good thing is that he's used to taking orders so he'll do great."

TBK_establish_office_prime_minister: "Congratulations\nPrime Minister!"
TBK_establish_office_prime_minister_desc: "Now that we've done some spring cleaning, it's high time to make things official. So congratulations, Bean Counter! You are now the head of government, serving at the president's leisure and responsible before parliament. And if it doesn't work out, Vasile will dismiss and replace him. That's how it works in a democracy, right? "

TBK_democratic_principles: "Soul of the State"
TBK_democratic_principles_desc: "Tobuck is a republic but it's always been run on promises and Vasile's careful maneuvering. However, it's not enough to walk the walk, the people wants to hear the right words too. So it's time to enshrine the principles of liberty and democracy within our constitution. With some guardrails of course. Don't want the crazies storming into office, now do we?"

TBK_tcp_supremacy: "Forwards Tobuck, Follow the TCP!"
TBK_tcp_supremacy_desc: "Vasile has done a lot for the nation but in truth, it was always a team effort. And that team is the Traditional Center Party. The TCP stands for liberty, for democracy, for prosperity and for victory! Bean Counter is the party chancellor and Vasile Cel Tradat its esteemed founder! So get in or get lost! Er, I mean, get in for Tobuck! Hurray."

TBK_tcp_propaganda: "There Is No Tobuck Without the TCP!"
TBK_tcp_propaganda_desc: "The party has never been the most active. So time to shake things up if we're going to make it for election day. Get your fat tails out of your sofas and start campaigning! Ring some bells, shake hooves and smile! Don't know how to do that? Grab some pamphlets and give them out! No, you're not getting paid for this! Your job is on the line!"

TBK_electoral_gamble: "Luck Never Dies"
TBK_electoral_gamble_desc: "The harmonic opposition constantly rants and rave about a free and fair election. And you know what? We're in. Let's do this. Let's have an election. A fair one. A quick one. What do they even have to offer that we don't? We've got the money, we've got the results, we've got the best candidate. Then again, it's a gamble but eh, we got this."

TBK_meet_opposition: "Shake Claw With Rose"
TBK_meet_opposition_desc: "Rose Rain. Leader of the Harmonic Front. It was such a cute idea that, allegedly, Pea Shooter sent a fruit basket when she had her first public meeting. However, she did manage to win over some ponies and is formally the head of our opposition. If we're going to make the people buy into this election, it's time to acknowledge her."

TBK_formalize_election_rigging: "One Citizen,\nOne Vote"
TBK_formalize_election_rigging_desc: "On paper, an election is something that is extremely simple. You vote and whoever gets the most votes wins. However, even the worst student of political science could tell you that there are finer details that can alter the outcome of an election and that the definition of winning is relative. We agree. So let's get to work on this"

TBK_citizen_fears: "Only Vasile Protects Your Interests, Citizen!"
TBK_citizen_fears_desc: "You know. Ponies are not really that dumb. They know that Vasile has some unsavory dealings here and there. But what about Rose? What was she doing? And what of the other candidates? All these politicians, do we know what they were doing during Pea's days? Meanwhile, you know Vasile and things are good. But the others? Can you trust them?"

TBK_sham_electoral_victory: "Three Hurrays To Victory"
TBK_sham_electoral_victory_desc: "Alright. Election day. What a blast this campaign has been. President cel Tradat has toured the nation with great success but now comes the moment of truth. I know we've stacked the deck but I'm starting to feel that the harmonists are onto something with this whole election thing. I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS ALIVE!"

TBK_entry_world_stage: "Enter the World"
TBK_entry_world_stage_desc: "Well. State building? Check. Defeat the lunatics? Check. Sounds like “this pompous griff from Brodfeld” has more than an ace in his sleeve, doesn't it? Now that we have proven ourselves, it is time to bring our unparalleled abilities to the world stage. Call in the translators. And a few crates of the best Aquileian wines. We don't want to be rude now, do we?"

TBK_warzena_choice: "What To Do With Warzena?"
TBK_warzena_choice_desc: "For as long as we've been independent and allegedly since Zarantia conquered Tobuck, Warzena has been a stick in the mud. Conflicts over water, over Dermarea, over alleged smuggling and weapons trafficking. It all needs to stop. And it'll either be with a smile or a bullet. Although Vasile would smile after the bullet too. Multitasking and all that."

They can't be any preachier than Equestria, right?"

TBK_maregypt_deal: "In the Land of Pyramids"
TBK_maregypt_deal_desc: "They say that a long time ago, Maregyptian settlers founded Tobuck.

We have yet to make actual contact with the cats. Perhaps it's time to go and see if we can make them purr. They say curiosity killed the cat but they never said anything about profitable financial speculation."

TBK_equestria_recognition: "Are We Legitimate Yet?"
TBK_equestria_recognition_desc: "We've cleaned up our act, destroyed the biggest bastion of anti-Equestrian terrorists in history and brought prosperity to the northwestern zebrican peninsula. And yet, Equestria still won't recognize us! It's time to put our hoof down and request what we are owed: basic respect for our people. Also, access to their massive pool of capital. Mostly that."

TBK_zarantia_recourse: "No Hard Feelings Zarantia?"
TBK_zarantia_recourse_desc: "So what if we offered you a deal you couldn't refuse and then asked you to shove it where the sun don't shine? That was all Pea Shooter and now we're brand new.

TBK_no_gods: "No Gods!"
TBK_no_gods_desc: "Religion is the opiate of the masses! That's what Wallnut's socialist friends say, and so far they haven't steered him wrong. Nightmarism is different, Nightmarism is more like cocaine, but they're both bad. No more priests, that's an order!"

TBK_challenge_normalcy: "Decadent Normalcy"

TBK_only_victory: "Only Victory!"

TBK_share_bat_horrors: "Lemme Tell You About Chiropterra!"
TBK_share_bat_horrors_desc: "One of the few times when Wallnut gets real quiet and serious is when talking about Chiropterra. It's a terrible place. The callous disregard for the lives of so-called "faithless," the oppressive atmosphere, the LMRD and the Nightmare's Hoof committing atrocities by the day. If there's one thing Wallnut Drive knows, it's that they must be stopped."

TBK_no_chains: "No Chains!"
TBK_no_chains_desc: "Gun runners are one thing, slavers are another. Slave traders, sweatshop owners, and those monsters who gave intelligence to the Chiropterrans to help them plan their slaving raids, they've all gotta go.

TBK_worker_pride: "Pride of the Labourer"
TBK_worker_pride_desc: "It's not just great ponies like Wallnut Drive who make the world go round; in fact he couldn't do anything without the hard work of the common labourer. We should celebrate that, and make sure workers know that they're appreciated, both in our hearts and with our wallets."

TBK_merchant_tobuck_desc: "Vasile is well known in Tobuck's business circles and was seemingly uninvolved in Pea Shooter's plot to sell the region back to Zarantia. We shall make proper use of his incredible economic expertise and grant him a position of administration over the city of Tobuck itself."

TBK_new_princely_guard: "The Oath Wardens"
TBK_new_princely_guard_desc: "Ancient legends tell of these soldiers, dutiful guards of Warzenan rulers. Such an idea is well suited to the exiled lord who is very much in need of protection and loyalty in this turbulent time for Tobuck. The legends shall once again have their names etched into history."

TBK_guard_recruitment: "Only the Finest Soldiers"
TBK_guard_recruitment_desc: "Mercenaries are no longer an appropriate name for Baragzen's finest soldiery. Though their reputation and skill arose from the lowest of the low, so did his legitimacy as ruler; it is only fitting that their discipline be drilled and reinforced by the Oath Wardens."

TBK_blood_warzena: "Blood of the Leopard"
TBK_blood_warzena_desc: "The Leopard bloodline in the Warzenan dynasties is an ancient and powerful one. It is demonstrative of the validity in any individual's claim to the Warzenan throne should such be prove, though Baragzen in particular may lay claim to the nation."

TBK_weak_brother: "The Weakling King"
TBK_weak_brother_desc: "The current Warzenan monarch is nothing more than a puppet of the hippogriff menace, a false inheritor of a glorious and yet untapped past and nation. We shall decry and denounce that traitor with all the resources available to our administration."

TBK_worthy_king: "The Worthy Heir"
TBK_worthy_king_desc: "Unlike the puppet monarch who currently sits on the throne, Baragzen is a warrior king like those of old; his claim to the throne is indisputable. We shall make a plublic declaration of our intentions to install the rightful king of Warzena, both to the public and to our enemy."

TBK_i_am_king: "The Abjuration Decree"
TBK_i_am_king_desc: "Baragzen's first law for the new realm is the Abjuration Decree. All power vested in government officials is to be subsumed by his will and whim, under no circumstances must this rule be ignored. Any remnants of Pea Shooter's republic will be eliminated for good."

TBK_secure_river_border: "The Demarean Embankments"
TBK_secure_river_border_desc: "Unlike his contemporary warlord commanders, Baragzen expresses no displeasure at the concept of flooding particular areas for the sake of defensive proficiency. If Chiropterra wishes to invade, then they shall meet a well prepared and dangerous foe."

TBK_alesia_start: "The White Severyan"
TBK_alesia_start_desc: "Through iron will and decisive action, Alesia Snezhnaya has emerged the dominant power in Tobuck. While the other warlords are cowed, she must find one of them to make a pact with and dispose of the other."

TBK_subdue_locals: "Righteous Rule"
TBK_subdue_locals_desc: "The Severyan tsars of old ruled with justice and fairness, but also cold efficiency. They had no time for foolish things like mercy, or forgiving those who deserved no forgiveness. Alesia will emulate their example, and crush the rebellious scum and the criminals of Tobuck in one swift blow."

TBK_evil_communism: "The Red Beast"
TBK_evil_communism_desc: "The one saving grace of Tobuck is that the godless venom of communism hasn't infected it. Alesia intends to keep it that way, and to use her new state as a hammer against the ravening red hordes."

TBK_defenders_traditions: "White Druzhina"
TBK_defenders_traditions_desc: "Now that Alesia has broken the deadlock of smugglers, warlords, and miscreants, she can centralize and discipline this rabble into a proper army. The first step is redistributing Alesia's loyal troops into the ranks of new regiments, where they will serve as instructors and discipline officers. These mixed Severyan-Tobuckian units will be the Druzhina, and the other units should strive to emulate them."

TBK_all_for_defence: "All For Triumph!"
TBK_all_for_defence_desc: "Resolute stoicism, unyielding determination, uncomplaining sacrifice. These were the values which made Severyana strong before the communist cancer rotted them away, and these are the values Alesia will instill by her example."

TBK_long_from_home: "It's Long Way To Princessyn"
TBK_long_from_home_desc: "The white exiles are few in number, but every single one of them is worth ten other ponies. Alesia will call upon old contacts and allies among the last true Severyans, and rekindle the dream of a new Severyana among them. One day, we shall return, and bring fire and death to the bloodthirsty beasts who despoil our lands."

TBK_new_exile_regiment: "We Are Severyan Soldiers"
TBK_new_exile_regiment_desc: "The advantage of coming to power in Tobuck is that it is a cultural blank slate. Thanks to this, we have been able to foster Severyan values of stoicism, sacrifice, hierarchy, and discipline among our soldiers, with no need to uproot an inferior service culture. The tales of Severyan heroes of old shall inspire our troops, and they will show the rabble of this continent what true warfare is!"

TBK_contact_kin: "The Exiled Community"
TBK_contact_kin_desc: "Alesia was already well-known among the Severyan exiles, and as news of her victory has spread more and more of her compatriots have begun to feel the old flames of patriotism rekindle. Some of the old nobility managed to escape with significant wealth, and now many of them are making generous donations to our cause."

TBK_severyan_family: "Severyana Endures Through Us"
TBK_severyan_family_desc: "Severyana may have fallen, first to the scheming princess and then to the vile communists, but so long as one true Severyanian draws breath it is not lost. Alesia will rule with the same rigid strength as the tsars of old, and muster her forces until, one day, the true foals of Severyana will return to drive out the parasites who feast on their homeland."

TBK_i_hate_sand_desc: "There is nothing worse than desert warfare. However, given Pea Shooter's machinations we will likely have to face the Zarantian savages sooner rather than later. Alesia has declared that we will construct a line of fortifications along their border, complete with minefields and concealed killzones, such that by the time we step into the desert there will only be corpses waiting for us."

TBK_full_war_economy: "All the Guns and Bullets"
TBK_full_war_economy_desc: "Our first priority should be getting guns into hooves. We'll use the remainder of the smugglers' ill-gotten-gains to purchase as many weapons as we can find, and scour the city to dredge up its hidden stashes. After that, we'll have to make our own."

TBK_pay_troops: "All Possible Troops"
TBK_pay_troops_desc: "Our first priority should be to get more hooves to hold guns. We will increase soldiers' pay to incentivize as many to enlist as possible, then extend conscription to make up the difference with draftees."

TBK_new_tobuck: "Death of Tobuck"
TBK_new_tobuck_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a sham state from the start. Few marked its passing, and fewer still will mourn it. It is time to formally bury the republic, so that our new order can begin in earnest."

TBK_liberal_politics:0 "The Common Good"
TBK_liberal_politics_desc:0 "The previous administration wasn’t exactly kind to its inhabitants which, though natural for what can only be described as a thinly-veiled corporatocracy, is far from fair. The federation exists for the benefit of the people, with the assent of the people and with its institutions at the behest of the people."

TBK_brand_new_bureaucracy:0 "Brand-New Bureaucracy"
TBK_brand_new_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Retaining any significant remnant of the old government will end in tears, not least for how impossibly corrupt the whole affair was. If we want to do things better than they did, we need to build the state institutions from the ground up and wipe the old slate clean."

TBK_purge_corruption:0 "War Against Corruption"
TBK_purge_corruption_desc:0 "We must forever be vigilant against the scourge of corruption, lest it take root in the federation as it did in Tobuck once before. Luckily nobody has a pile of guns to make use of this time, but that doesn’t make the state invincible to the vile tendrils of malpractice and embezzling."

TBK_federal_framework:0 "Federal Framework"
TBK_federal_framework_desc:0 "Given the inherent difficulties of unitary administration, a federal framework for governing is the logical next step for our future endeavours. Decentralisation is a necessary facet of modern bureaucracy that simply cannot be overlooked when having to organise a reasonably sized state."

TBK_delegionarization:0 "Delegionarization"
TBK_delegionarization_desc:0 "If the new federal framework is to function, the bottom line is that the system of families and legions must be entirely dismantled. All will be equal citizens within the federation and none will have their future decided by birth or by battle; unless they decide to enlist in the latter case, of course."

TBK_defence_religions_law:0 "Sanctity of Religion Act"
TBK_defence_religions_law_desc:0 "Though secularism is immensely important to the governance of any state, there are many in the federation who worship the Nightmare and other gods like Zal and Zanit. It would be remiss of us not to guarantee the freedom of religion to our citizens, especially given their affection for their deities."

TBK_reparations_law:0 "Reparations Act"
TBK_reparations_law_desc:0 "We cannot allow the destruction of war to alienate the Chiropterrans and drive them away from our Hazrumenian family. To that end it is imperative that we compensate them for the suffering that they endured, painful to the coffers as it may be."

TBK_forgivness_act:0 "To Move Onwards"
TBK_forgivness_act_desc:0 "With amends made and the disparate peoples of our federation closer knit, we can finally claim that all is well with the Chiropterrans. The estranged brother of the Hazrumenian family has finally come home to rest, having made up with their siblings."

TBK_federal_elections:0 "National Elections"
TBK_federal_elections_desc:0 "The time has come to organise the national elections, the best way to elect a new head of state is to vote them in at the top level after all! Now we just have to let everyone know who’s on the ballot and what their tenets in leadership will be. Shouldn’t be too hard, right?"

TBK_local_elections:0 "Local Elections"
TBK_local_elections_desc:0 "The time has come to organise local elections; the best way to run a country is to have the people vote for local representatives and build up from there after all!! Now we just have to let everyone know who’s on the ballot and what their tenets in leadership will be. Shouldn’t be too hard, right?"

TBK_electoral_law:0 "Who Can Run?"
TBK_electoral_law_desc:0 "Carrot stick is a firm believer that anti-democratic parties and individuals shouldn’t be able to run for office, but Rose Rain disagrees. Hopefully they can set aside their differences in the upcoming debate, either that or one of them will take the lead and get their way..."

TBK_democratic_propaganda:0 "ULZ Stands For Democracy"
TBK_democratic_propaganda_desc:0 "If there is one thing that unites all peoples of the federation, it is democracy in Hazrumenia. We are many different cultures, races and hold many different beliefs and loyalties; but our citizens may be united in their say over who leads our great state."

TBK_formal_constitution:0 "Formal Constitution"
TBK_formal_constitution_desc:0 "It’s about time we put pen to paper and wrote ourselves a formal constitution so that we may enshrine the rights of our citizens and provide a legal framework for the courts. It may be somewhat of a daunting task, but it’s not as though it can’t be amended in the future."

TBK_united_police_force:0 "Marshals of Law"
TBK_united_police_force_desc:0 "If there was any one thing that was needed in the republic, it was a half decent police force that was actually capable of protecting the people. It’s high time we got around to constructing a competent force that has the capacity to handle domestic troubles without the help of the army."

TBK_election_day:0 "The First Elections"
TBK_election_day_desc:0 "The day has finally arrived! The elections are here and it’s time to get down to the voting booths to get your votes out! Remember, the ballots are supposed to be secret and it’s our duty to make sure they stay that way!"

TBK_strategic_tactical_division:0 "Special Tactical Directive"
TBK_strategic_tactical_division_desc:0 "The great thing about police forces is that they can really specialise when it comes to training. We can make use of this capacity for further tactical training in establishing a new secret service that will, with a little luck, help us greatly in defending our ever-growing Hazrumenian family."

TBK_democracy_victory:0 "Hurray Wallnut!\nHurray Democracy!"
TBK_democracy_victory_desc:0 "We’ve actually managed to create a successful democracy in a successor state to a sham republic. It’s no surprise that Wallnut and his friends are being celebrated for their work in founding the federation after such a feat as that. Long live democracy! Long live the Generalissimo!"

TBK_old_administrative_framework:0 "The Old Framework"
TBK_old_administrative_framework_desc:0 "Even though it was a corrupt mess, not all of it was inherently broken; the republic just had a lot of bad apples running the show. Keeping some of the old institutions around won’t do us any harm now that we’ve gotten rid of them, we just have to make sure other kleptocrats stay out of office."

TBK_old_civil_knowledge:0 "The Stout Civil Service"
TBK_old_civil_knowledge_desc:0 "Having pruned the old civil service and made sure everything’s running smoothly, we now have a fairly small but particularly efficient bureaucracy that should be able to handle whatever we throw at them. Well, so long as we make sure they stay well paid that is."

TBK_grand_freedoms:0 "Grand Rights of Everycreature"
TBK_grand_freedoms_desc:0 "A comprehensive list of rights for all citizens is a necessity for the continued growth of our Hazrumenian family. It must cover all bases and protect all creatures and their interests, from the lowliest of pauper to the richest business owner. A federation for all!"

TBK_enshrine_democracy:0 "The Cause of Democratic-Harmonism"
TBK_enshrine_democracy_desc:0 "Though harmony may find its origins in benign absolutism of old, the modern ideal of democracy and harmony combined is perhaps the greatest combination of political ideas yet created. We must protect our citizens and their right to a representative and harmonious society!"

TBK_great_public_works:0 "Federal Public Works"
TBK_great_public_works_desc:0 "State funded infrastructure projects are the next step in building and expanding on the existing civilian economy within the federation. Our Hazrumenian family shall prosper for the benefit of every individual within that very family. Onwards and upwards!"

TBK_rebuild_ruins:0 "Reconstruction Bureau"
TBK_rebuild_ruins_desc:0 "There is much to do in the reconstruction of the land and industry following the nigh-cataclysmic war with Chiropterra. If we wish to build back stronger than before then we must make significant headway in rebuilding what was lost in order to build off of it."

TBK_employment_welfare:0 "Work For the Unemployed"
TBK_employment_welfare_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that national projects are good for, it’s reducing the number of unemployed creatures and improving national infrastructure. What better way to get things going again whilst improving the interconnectivity of the federation?"

TBK_unified_education:0 "Unified Education Program"
TBK_unified_education_desc:0 "It’s about time we sorted out some national standards for education, something that’s currently either disparate at best or entirely nonexistent depending on which part of the federation you live in. We’ll make best sure to get the foals reading books and writing stories for our Hazrumenian family."

TBK_students_and_employers:0 "Student-Employer Vocational Scheme"
TBK_students_and_employers_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that students should be doing after school, it’s practical studies. They need the skills and a bigger labour pool is never something to avoid. The state will set up programmes to make sure they leave education with the knowledge they need to go right into work!"

TBK_academic_benefits:0 "Academic Research"
TBK_academic_benefits_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that students should be doing after school, it’s further education. We need forward-thinking innovators to propel the federation into a new age. The state will make sure that every student knows that they have every opportunity to contribute to science!"

TBK_tobuck_campus:0 "Wallnut Heritage College"
TBK_tobuck_campus_desc:0 "What better than to open a new centre for higher education named after the one and only Wallnut Drive! Sure he’s never had tertiary education himself, but the state is sure that he’ll appreciate the gesture all the same; a new college is still a new college in any case!"

TBK_pension_plans:0 "Universal Pensions Bill"
TBK_pension_plans_desc:0 "Pensions for the weary citizens within our ever-growing Hazrumenian family are a natural progression of existing worker laws. We shall reward those who have worked hard to lay the foundations of and build the federation that so many now live within."

TBK_subsidized_healthcare:0 "Subsidized Healthcare"
TBK_subsidized_healthcare_desc:0 "Though fully state-funded healthcare is currently beyond the purview of the government’s budget, we are far from incapable of helping. The state will front a portion of all medical costs for the good of the family that it protects and cherishes."

TBK_liberal_economics:0 "The Free Market"
TBK_liberal_economics_desc:0 "Opening up to the world is necessary for progress and for prosperity. We cannot sit idly by as our neighbours embrace external markets and the careful guiding hoof of economic liberalism. The time has come for our Hazrumenian family to embrace another important aspect of modern harmony."

TBK_two_half_plan:0 "2&¾ Year Plan"
TBK_two_half_plan_desc:0 "If we are to develop Hazrumenia, then it would be best if we developed the lands quickly so that our enemies may not take advantage of our weakened capacity. Rapid industrialization and modernisation must carry forth our federal dreams."

TBK_farmer_bonds:0 "Bonds For Farmers"
TBK_farmer_bonds_desc:0 "Investments are a surefire way to encourage continued economic growth, particularly in sectors that leave much to be desired. Farmers and their farms lack considerable amounts of equipment and knowhow when it comes to mechanised farming, so we’ll give them the means to figure it out!"

TBK_diversified_crops:0 "Diversified Fields"
TBK_diversified_crops_desc:0 "We can’t simply rely on subsistence farming anymore if we wish to make full use of both the ongoing economic growth and the money to be made in selling our produce. The state will provide minor incentives to grow secondary crops and our farmers will soon reap the benefits of their plurality of plants."

TBK_agricultural_development_focus:0 "Ministry of Agriculture And Rural Development"
TBK_agricultural_development_focus_desc:0 "With the meteoric rise in our farming industry, things have begun to get a little messy regarding land use and the general surplus of certain produce on the market. With a state ministry to get things organised, we should see development continue at an exponential rate!"

TBK_corporate_farms:0 "Corporate Farms"
TBK_corporate_farms_desc:0 "With the growth of any market comes the gradual development of larger companies that begin to compete with one another for their fair share in the sector. Luckily for the state, this means that they’ll keep their prices down for competition’s sake and develop the surrounding lands for us!"

TBK_agricultural_mechanization:0 "Tractor Co-Operatives"
TBK_agricultural_mechanization_desc:0 "Though we have done much to improve the average financial stock of all individuals within Hazrumenia, modern agricultural equipment is still really quite expensive. To that end, cooperative projects in which equipment is shared alongside profits will be a great boon for our agricultural endeavours."

TBK_efficient_supply_lines:0 "From Field To Plants"
TBK_efficient_supply_lines_desc:0 "A little optimization can go a long way and the supply chain between the farms and the processing plants is far from perfect. With a little work and some careful planning, it should be no time before the rail networks and road routes can support the vastly increased production."

TBK_development_plans:0 "General Development Plans"
TBK_development_plans_desc:0 "As the name would suggest, the government has developed some rather loose plans for the development of the economy and in particular of our industry. With just a little industrial zoning and lot allocation, we can easily provide land and list requirements for the construction of new industrial plants."

TBK_infrastructure_expansion:0 "Federal Railway Union"
TBK_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "Though some are concerned about the emergence of unions, they nevertheless hold an important place in politics and industrial development. Should the railroads go silent, the economy would grind to a halt; it’s best we keep the track workers and train drivers on side."

TBK_roadways:0 "The Black Veins"
TBK_roadways_desc:0 "The dark tarmac of roads are the lifeblood of both our civilian and military infrastructure and represent an immensely important asset for the administration. Though it will make the coffers suffer in the short term, investing in our transport network only promises great things in the future."

TBK_wholecase_urbanization:0 "The Concrete Future"
TBK_wholecase_urbanization_desc:0 "Whilst it is true that industry can often be overbearing when it comes to the grey concrete and the dark smog of progress, it is a necessary evil. The state will do its best to protect places of historical import across Hazrumenia, but nothing and nobody will stand in the way of progress and prosperity."

TBK_synthetic_oil_investment:0 "Synthetic Gasoline Industries"
TBK_synthetic_oil_investment_desc:0 "Though traces of black gold in Zarantia may eventually reveal more substantial fields, for the moment oil remains a resource which we have precious little access to. The obvious course of action is to invest in synthetic programmes through which we can create a local surplus for civilian and military use."

TBK_manehattan_of_zebrica:0 "Manehattan of Zebrica"
TBK_manehattan_of_zebrica_desc:0 "Manehatten is the city of dreams and Tobuck is far achieving such a title, or at least it was merely a decade ago. Now it’s the centre of a new harmonic society, a beacon of what can be achieved even in the most insidious and morally bankrupt regimes. Perhaps our capital is worthy of such a title too."

TBK_free_trade_enshrined:0 "Embrace Free Trade"
TBK_free_trade_enshrined_desc:0 "Far from the shady dealings of Pea Shooter and the centralised system that reigned prior to the creation of the federation, free trade is a logical evolution of state policy. If we are truly to provide individuals with equality of opportunity, then we must make trade fair game for all."

TBK_foreign_investors:0 "Court the Investors"
TBK_foreign_investors_desc:0 "‘Brown nosing’ isn’t exactly the most well respected of activities amongst business owners and investors, but it certainly does the job if you can do it right. With a little work and a lot of patience, we can instil some international confidence in our economy."

TBK_federal_bit:0 "North Zebrican Bit"
TBK_federal_bit_desc:0 "The Equestrians are yet to adopt harmony in its true form, but they’ve done a lot of things right in the time it’s taken to get them here. More specifically, they have embraced the idea of a unifying currency and it would be prudent of us to take that leaf out of their book."

TBK_banking_act:0 "The Bill and Coin Act"
TBK_banking_act_desc:0 "If we want to have a dependable and stable currency, it is imperative that the state guarantees the private holdings of investors and citizens alike. We cannot have criminals or simple economic crises destroy the good faith in our economy that we have established."

TBK_investment_boon:0 "Investment Boon"
TBK_investment_boon_desc:0 "Investment is a necessary part of modern economics and individuals often have the power to make or break important fiscal deals. Bean Counter and his associates are more than capable of serving as an economic consultancy for the government, especially now that we've guaranteed their holdings."

TBK_rich_society:0 "Prosperity Garners Prosperity"
TBK_rich_society_desc:0 "If there’s one thing economic growth is good for, it’s more economic growth! It’s a circular system of investment, the investments paying off and both parties profiting and then using that money to make more investments; isn't money a brilliant thing?"

TBK_wallnut_economic_miracle:0 "Land of Hard Work"
TBK_wallnut_economic_miracle_desc:0 "Our Hazrumenian family is certainly innovative and prosperous, but also we’re a hardworking bunch on top of that! As long as we make our money and the pensions for the work we do are good, anyone can do anything in this lovely federation of ours."

TBK_wallnuts_industrialists:0 "My Good Moguls"
TBK_wallnuts_industrialists_desc:0 "Though it surprised everyone initially, it seems as though Vasile Tradat, Bean Counter and Home Brew have taken to legitimate business in earnest. With their expertise and skill in deal brokering, they’re certain to make quite a name for themselves."

TBK_bean_counter_business:0 "B. Counter & Co."
TBK_bean_counter_business_desc:0 "Bean Counter recently decided to found a small string of banks with his financial expertise, a small string of banks which have rapidly become some of the larger economic entities within the borders of the federation. Needless to say that liaising with some of their experts will be most beneficial."

TBK_home_brew_business:0 "Homely Coffee Corporation"
TBK_home_brew_business_desc:0 "Coffee has quickly become one of the most valuable commodities the world over. To nopony’s surprise, Home Brew was quick to capitalise off of the rapid growth of an industry in which he already took interest and is already reaping the benefits of his good timing."

TBK_vasile_business:0 "Tradat Manuafacturing"
TBK_vasile_business_desc:0 "Given his cooperation with Pea Shooter, it’s no surprise that Vasile has sauntered confidently back into the arms business. Though the weapons designed under his company have thus far been rather unorthodox, they also seem to work surprisingly well and can be made for cheap."

TBK_stimulate_economy:0 "Stimulate Economy"
TBK_stimulate_economy_desc:0 "Private investments are important, but the state is an incredibly important part of economic development; especially when it comes to funding. Providing citizens with economic incentives to start their own companies and further the industrial development of Hazrumenia is our prerogative."

TBK_free_growth:0 "Fiscal Autonomy"
TBK_free_growth_desc:0 "The state has no business in business. It should remain entirely independent of economic affairs and allow growth to happen at a more natural pace. A government’s duty is to its citizens in resolving disputes and maintaining a monopoly on force to protect the citizens from one another."

TBK_private_markets:0 "Competetive Innovations"
TBK_private_markets_desc:0 "Competition within markets is the most important factor for spurring innovation and sector development, far more influential than even the best of corporate reviews for efficiency. With this in mind, continual technological development and its use in state industries is an inevitability."

TBK_issue_monopolies:0 "Theory of Monopoly"
TBK_issue_monopolies_desc:0 "Whilst monopolies can certainly be detrimental to any market, they can only maintain their position if they continue to innovate. With this in mind, the administration can make use of the continued battle for market control in its own acquisitions and the application of new technology."

TBK_foster_competition:0 "Laws of Competition"
TBK_foster_competition_desc:0 "Competition in internal Hazrumenian markets is just as important as competition in the global market and may not be sullied by any existing or potential monopolies. We must always encourage easily available technology via continued prosperity from competition."

TBK_raw_resource_exploitation:0 "Riches of Land"
TBK_raw_resource_exploitation_desc:0 "For all the deserts and the jungles in Hazrumenia, the land that is usable has much to covet both in fertility and in resources. It’s high time we began a proper extraction program to make best use of our natural bounty, not least for the fact that we now have a stable market to sell on."

TBK_ulnz_mining_ministry:0 "ULNZ Bureau of Mines"
TBK_ulnz_mining_ministry_desc:0 "Resource extraction is a complicated affair when it comes to organisation, permits and all the other administrative aspects that make paper pushers suffer. It would be best if the state created a subordinate ministry to handle the paperwork for our ever-growing mining sector."

TBK_analyze_lands:0 "Conduct Land Analysis"
TBK_analyze_lands_desc:0 "There’s no better time than the present to formally survey the land and see what Hazrumenia has to offer. Given our already considerable mining industry, it stands to reason that the administration’s efforts to expand it should return our investments many times over."

TBK_griffonian_mining_companies:0 "Miners of Griffonia"
TBK_griffonian_mining_companies_desc:0 "The griffons are industrious creatures and are particularly talented in the field of resource extraction, both for their coveted techniques and their enchanted equipment. We could make great use of their expertise and would do well to invite whichever companies we can contact."

TBK_wingbardian_company:0 "Azienda Generale Wingbardia Petroli"
TBK_wingbardian_company_desc:0 "The Wingbardians are uniquely gifted in the field of oil and oil-based resources. With their help we can make great strides in the field of synthetic materials, particularly with regard to rubber and the exploitation of - unsurprisingly - oil."

TBK_republican_company:0 "Société Métallurgique de Orvalillo"
TBK_republican_company_desc:0 "The Aquileia are uniquely gifted in the field of metalwork and the industries surrounding its usage. With their help we can make great strides in the field of metallurgy, particularly with regard to aluminium and the exploitation of iron deposits which we can use to make steel."

TBK_wallnut_harmony_diplomacy:0 "The Wallnut Pledge"
TBK_wallnut_harmony_diplomacy_desc:0 "Wallnut has always stood for democracy, harmony and our geopolitical aims. It is his dream to unite the seemingly disparate members of the Hazrumenian family and bring them into the fold with open arms. He will defend our dream and our cause, to the very end."

TBK_harmony_alliance_internal_development:0 "Treaty of Tobuck"
TBK_harmony_alliance_internal_development_desc:0 "A formal declaration to all nearby Harmonists of our intentions will do wonders for our international reputation, not least for the fact that they may be willing to assist in our future endeavours for our Hazrumenian family as a result."

TBK_harmony_alliance_vaccine_plan:0 "War Against Pandemics"
TBK_harmony_alliance_vaccine_plan_desc:0 "Disease has always been one of the most potent killers, moreso even than war and perhaps famine too. It is the charge of the government and of all members of the Hazrumenian family to work towards eliminating such diseases through medical cooperation."

TBK_harmony_alliance_research_cooperation:0 "HETA"
TBK_harmony_alliance_research_cooperation_desc:0 "Science and technology are something which all nations strive to improve over time, but it is strangely uncommon for many nations to cooperate in order to achieve the desired innovation. With the Hazrumenian Education and Technology Assembly, this will change for the better."

TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_vision:0 "Shared Vision"
TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_vision_desc:0 "The federation and our Hazrumenian family have a vision of democracy, of harmony and of freedom. It is a dream we all share and wish to work towards, a future within our grasp. Soon we will have our collective vision come to pass, united and free."

TBK_harmony_alliance_state_visits:0 "State Visits"
TBK_harmony_alliance_state_visits_desc:0 "There’s nothing like a visit - or a party - to really cement relations and cooperation between partners in harmony and democracy. What better than for Wallnut to officially visit our neighbours and charm them with his characteristic smile?"

TBK_harmony_alliance_council:0 "Council of Hazrumenia"
TBK_harmony_alliance_council_desc:0 "Though not an official legislative body in any real capacity, the Council of Hazrumenia will serve as an important supranational body in which to discuss a unified approach to foreign policy and international relations. More cooperation between members of the Hazrumenian family is always a good thing."

TBK_harmony_alliance_security_cooperation:0 "Mutual Security"
TBK_harmony_alliance_security_cooperation_desc:0 "An attack against one is an attack against all, we must be ready to defend our Hazrumenian family from all that seek to tear it apart. Interlinking the high commands of each military and endeavouring to prepare every state for war is a necessity for our security."

TBK_harmony_alliance_army_exercises:0 "Supranational Military Exercises"
TBK_harmony_alliance_army_exercises_desc:0 "If we are to embrace full military readiness against any possible threat to the federation and our family, we must train our troops to be ready to defend us. It could be the Colthaginians, it could be the Hippogriffs or even the Maregyptians; whatever the case, we must be prepared."

TBK_harmony_alliance_army_integration:0 "United Hazrumenian Defence Force"
TBK_harmony_alliance_army_integration_desc:0 "The dream of Hazrumenian harmony is something that every creature can stand up for. With a little effort towards recruiting and a large emphasis on the importance of supranational defence, we will be able to mobilise a large number of currently idle individuals."

TBK_harmony_alliance_cultural_work:0 "Land of Many Equines"
TBK_harmony_alliance_cultural_work_desc:0 "Ponies, Zebras and thestrals. We are many and may differ in appearance, but together we are united and strong; we will fight for our family and our dream! Our vision for democracy and freedom shall not be trodden on by sentiments of race or disparity!"

TBK_harmony_alliance_we_are_hazrumenians:0 "We Are All Hazrumenians"
TBK_harmony_alliance_we_are_hazrumenians_desc:0 "There is one thing that unites us. It’s not culture, heritage or race; but our family. We are all Hazrumenians, a proud and stalwart people filled with vigour and a desire to be free! We are all part of something greater, something that every single creature can be proud of!"

TBK_warzena_union:0 "Harmony In Warzena"
TBK_warzena_union_desc:0 "The history of Warzena and Tobuck is not an easy one to overcome, but it is one that gives our citizens something to reflect upon. Our Hazrumenian family will never be torn apart by squabbles and ridiculous conflicts over land. Never another custodianship!"

TBK_union_warzena_bonus:0 "Re-Invigorate Trade Routes"
TBK_union_warzena_bonus_desc:0 "Before the invasion of the Storm King, there were relatively stable trading relations established between the city of Tobuck and the Warzenan kingdom. Though they have been long dormant, those routes should be opened once more; as both a kind and profitable gesture of friendship."

TBK_union_warzena_integration:0 "Riverlands of Warzena"
TBK_union_warzena_integration_desc:0 "Warzena has always been a rich land full of winding rivers and thoughtful zebras. They have never before been closer to the hooves of their Hazrumenian family and the time has come to welcome them back, forgiving them for their warlike past and supporting their reforms."

TBK_hippogriffia_talks:0 "Telegram To Aris"
TBK_hippogriffia_talks_desc:0 "Even though they occupy Hazrumenian land, they’re not so bad. With a little effort and an outstretched hoof, a telegram to their doorstep may indeed be well received. Perhaps we may yet make friends with these curious outsiders."

TBK_maregypt_diplomacy:0 "Entente With Maregypt"
TBK_maregypt_diplomacy_desc:0 "Though a military alliance is likely off of the table, that doesn’t mean we can’t build bridges with the Maregyptians. After all, they built Tobuck way back in ancient times; the least we could do is offer them an accord."

TBK_zumidian_issue:0 "The Zumidian Lands"
TBK_zumidian_issue_desc:0 "One pressing matter on which we must unfortunately confront Mount Aris is the matter of their Zumidian territories. Not only were they gained through conquest, but they remain unrepresented and are an integral part of Hazrumenia. Come what may, we must ask the difficult question."

TBK_zumidian_integration:0 "Federal District of Zumidia"
TBK_zumidian_integration_desc:0 "Zumidia has lacked democracy and harmony for many years now and, though the right to self determination cannot be denied, it would be the responsible course of action to ensure they get it right first time as part of the federation. They can always vote to succeed later, after all."

TBK_zumidian_bonus:0 "Zumidian Republic"
TBK_zumidian_bonus_desc:0 "Though we’ll stick our hooves in to make sure nothing too concerning comes out of the blue, our Zumidian siblings must have their own republic to decide their own fate. Our Hazrumenian dream is one of cooperation between respected family members, not one of forced assimilation."

TBK_colthage_diplomacy:0 "Detente With Colthage"
TBK_colthage_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Colthagians haven’t exactly been the most stable bunch as of late, nor have they been the most polite when discussing the matter of Zumidia. In fact, given the chance, it’s likely that they’d try to take it for themselves. It would be prudent for us to make sure they remain cordial."

TBK_harmony_alliance_economy:0 "Hazrumenian Commercial Pact"
TBK_harmony_alliance_economy_desc:0 "If there’s one thing that freedom has taught us it’s that the less boundaries there are between countries and peoples, the quicker the economy grows. Our Hazrumenian family will share in this prosperity in due time, once we show them the ropes."

TBK_zarantia_union:0 "Harmony In Zarantia"
TBK_zarantia_union_desc:0 "Ah, the Zarantians. They’ve never been a particularly aggressive bunch, but they do always seem to have an eye for our capital city. All the same, we can forgive their desire for modernisation through force and welcome them to our dream for Hazrumenia."

TBK_union_zarantia_bonus:0 "Right of Free Travel"
TBK_union_zarantia_bonus_desc:0 "There aren’t many creatures that would willingly travel into the tribal lands of Zarantia, but those that would like to visit deserve as much of a chance as those that would like to move to Tobuck from the desert. Free movement for all, free travel for prosperity and harmony!"

TBK_union_zarantia_integration:0 "Dunes of Zarantia"
TBK_union_zarantia_integration_desc:0 "TThough we’ve had our differences in the past, the Zarantians are now nothing less than another loving sibling in our Hazrumenian family. It’s high time that we embrace them fully and welcome them with open arms, celebrating the true victory of the tribes in their march towards modernity."

TBK_harmony_alliance_conference:0 "All-Members Economic Forum"
TBK_harmony_alliance_conference_desc:0 "Economic cooperation is the next logical step in supranational integration, providing a basis upon which to provide prosperity for all within the union. Development and industry for all members of the union and economic infrastructure to connect all peoples!"

TBK_harmony_alliance_tariffs:0 "Tariff Reductions"
TBK_harmony_alliance_tariffs_desc:0 "Though many would have you believe that tariffs grant wealth to the countries that they protect the resources of, the opposite is in fact true. In the long term, tariffs create economic barriers between states that limit potential growth; our Hazrumenian family has no need for such things."

TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_passport:0 "Hazrumenian Passport"
TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_passport_desc:0 "Passports make identification easier, but what’s the point of every Hazrumenian state having its own passport if free travel between borders is already encouraged? This status quo will not do, the state will provide all union citizens with Hazrumenian passports instead, for the sake of efficiency."

TBK_harmony_alliance_development_fund:0 "Hazrumenian Development Bureau"
TBK_harmony_alliance_development_fund_desc:0 "Facilitating development has proven to be a somewhat arduous task for the separated bureaucracies of the union states. To mitigate these issues, a unified planning office shall be established with the intention of streamlining the process and improving it to no end."

TBK_harmony_alliance_infrastructure:0 "Railway Gauge Uniformity"
TBK_harmony_alliance_infrastructure_desc:0 "The disparate railway gauges have proven to be problematic for transport between union states both in terms of civilian movement and goods transportation. Ensuring that these issues do not persist is as simple as making sure we all use the same convenient rail dimensions."

TBK_harmony_alliance_one_currency:0 "The Union Shekel"
TBK_harmony_alliance_one_currency_desc:0 "Much like our own federal currency, convenience and prosperity can be further ensured by introducing and utilising a broadly accepted union currency that will be far more reliable than local ones. What is a union without unity? What is prosperity if it isn’t shared with all?"

TBK_harmony_alliance_fixed_rates:0 "Fixed Exchange Rates"
TBK_harmony_alliance_fixed_rates_desc:0 "Fixed exchange rates will ensure that no matter the circumstances, outside enterprises will have their investments guaranteed. We would be nothing without common faith in our economy and so the same must be true of our Hazrumenian family too."

TBK_harmony_alliance_central_bank:0 "Hazrumenian Central Bank"
TBK_harmony_alliance_central_bank_desc:0 "A central bank is just as important for a union of countries as it is for the constituent countries themselves. A place where loans and debts can be sorted out on a far grander scale will doubtless be useful for our growing Hazrumenian family."

TBK_harmony_alliance_agriculture_pact:0 "Shared Comission of Agriculture"
TBK_harmony_alliance_agriculture_pact_desc:0 "Though not exactly an integral part of Hazrumenian development, agricultural growth is incredibly important for certain areas of the union in which food is considerably more scarce. An organisation for directing the expansion of the agricultural sectors within the union is a prudent solution."

TBK_harmony_alliance_cross_border_industries:0 "Cross-Border Industrial Development"
TBK_harmony_alliance_cross_border_industries_desc:0 "Parallel development of industries and infrastructure over constituent state borders is something that should be encouraged for the sake of cooperation between all parts of our Hazrumenian family. Who would willingly cut themselves off from industry and progress?"

TBK_hazrumenia_union:0 "Harmonious Hazrumenia"
TBK_hazrumenia_union_desc:0 "We have finally done it; one Hazrumenia under harmony, liberty and democracy! The years spent getting to this point have all been worth it to see our dream of a united Hazrumenian family fulfilled. Long live the union, long live the federation and long live harmony!"

### Wallnut Communist tree

TBK_dusk_wane_start:0 "Voices of the Workers"
TBK_dusk_wane_start_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, Tobuck has become more than just another minor state in Zebrica. The work is far from done, however. Having convinced Wallnut to adopt a socialist government, Dusk Wane must now tackle the issues that plague the working class of the newly formed United Lands of Northern Zebrica."

TBK_dusk_labour_front:0 "United Labour Front"
TBK_dusk_labour_front_desc:0 "Ensuring that the common worker feels safe at home and work should be the ultimate goal of any worthwhile socialist nation; with happy workers comes a prosperous state, after all. At Dusk's recommendation, Wallnut has signed off on the creation of an official state-run union: the United Labour Front."

TBK_convince_temples:0 "Sanctuaries of Communities"
TBK_convince_temples_desc:0 "The ponies of Chiropterra are afraid of what we will do to their temples now that we control them. Wallnut had originally wanted them all torn down, but Dusk Wane has managed to convince him that promising to rebuild and remodel them would lead to a more enthusiastic and agreeable populace."

TBK_old_teachings:0 "The Ancient Moon"
TBK_old_teachings_desc:0 "A thousand years of brainwashing isn't easy to overcome, and yet when you walk through the streets of New Ayacachtli something peculiar becomes apparent: Ponies are starting to feel less like Chiropterrans and more like citizens of the United Lands of Northern Zebrica. Perhaps in time they will overcome their deep-rooted obsession for Nightmare Moon in favour of the Old Moon as well."

TBK_communal_administration:0 "Out With the Old,\nIn With the Unions!"
TBK_communal_administration_desc:0 "As the workers of Chiropterra grow more and more accustomed to running things themselves, it is only sensical that their fledgling unions should be allowed more control over their daily lives. After all, nobody knows the workers' needs like they themselves do."

TBK_merge_faith_and_unions:0 "The Red Moon Edict"
TBK_merge_faith_and_unions_desc:0 "No more will the Nightmare hold dominion over this land! Let it be known that the Old Moon treats all equally, and so shall we as well! From the meekest of workers to the most respected of union members, all will enjoy a prosperous and more meaningful life!"

TBK_moonspeaker_union:0 "Federated Union of Moonspeakers"
TBK_moonspeaker_union_desc:0 "After we made our intentions to preserve the temples of Chiropterra clear, a group of Moonspeakers informed us that they have created an organization which seeks to help the ponies of Chiropterra come around to Wallnut's administration. All they are asking for are funds to help rebuild the devastated parts of their communities and feed those that are suffering."

TBK_police_union:0 "Commune Constabularies"
TBK_police_union_desc:0 "Though we have achieved victory over the Legionnaires, there are still pockets of fanatical elites causing issues across the countryside. With Wallnut's approval, Dusk Wane will implement police reforms aimed at bringing these criminals to justice."

TBK_social_welfare_system:0 "Welfare Solidarity"
TBK_social_welfare_system_desc:0 "With a new nation comes new issues. Among them, poverty is a particularly severe problem that few like to think about. With the seizure of Chiropterra's treasury, putting some money into the hooves of those who truly need it shouldn't be too difficult."

TBK_extensive_aid:0 "Wholesale Aid"
TBK_extensive_aid_desc:0 "A society and state, no matter how just and righteous, will always have those who fall through the cracks. It is our duty to these creatures to provide them with aid and kindness, as it always was their right to receive such. From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs."

TBK_jobs_network:0 "Work For Workless"
TBK_jobs_network_desc:0 "The poorest dregs of a society and state will often find themselves without work and thusly without any way to climb out of the depths in which they languish. We shall establish a collection of offices which can be visited in order to find vacancies in low skill jobs so that they may achieve a semblance of monetary security."

TBK_socialist_healthcare:0 "Communal Clinics"
TBK_socialist_healthcare_desc:0 "The concept of a community doctor is not a new one, but formalising the role of local specialists so that we may aid them with equipment and greater education will allow even the most serious injuries to be treated at a moment's notice without needing to travel to a city."

TBK_national_identity_card:0 "N.I.C"
TBK_national_identity_card_desc:0 "The National Identity Card system is certainly something that will take our citizens some getting used to. Despite what some may say, Dusk Wane has assured that its purpose is entirely organisational; the intention is to use them to keep track of places of work, marital status and other such things for the sake of record keeping."

TBK_good_food:0 "Superior Food,\nSuperior Workers"
TBK_good_food_desc:0 "Despite our policy of food for all no matter the circumstances, it has been brought to our attention that some of the food going around might be better left uneaten. In response, Wallnut has approved Dusk Wane's proposal to implement a national standard for food products both imported and natively produced or made."

TBK_confiscate_wealth:0 "Fruits of Their Labour"
TBK_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "Though Chiropterra may have called them "Labourers", these poor ponies have suffered many injustices ranging from being torn away from their families to being forced to serve a goddess that they didn't believe in! The least we can do is offer them their own plot of land and a future that they can decide for themselves."

TBK_labour_union_formations:0 "For the Unions Make Us Strong"
TBK_labour_union_formations_desc:0 "Unions are the backbone of any true socialist nation. Though we have made this an important topic in several meetings, many workers still do not even understand the concept of a union. Dusk never liked propaganda, but he concedes that in this case helping the workers understand that they can support one another through unions is important."

TBK_power_unions:0 "Death of Nationalism"
TBK_power_unions_desc:0 "For years many citizens of our nation have considered themselves loyal to Zarantia, even going so far as to refuse to fight against them. Times are changing now and the future we are working towards is brighter than that which any desert queen could ever hope to offer."

TBK_factory_production_councils:0 "Oust the Owners"
TBK_factory_production_councils_desc:0 "The cruel overseers of the former "Labourers" have had their say over the industrial sector for too long! Dusk has proposed that these individuals be removed and replaced with a council comprised of more humble workers in order to streamline production."

TBK_wealth_equalization:0 "Land of the Equals"
TBK_wealth_equalization_desc:0 "If we are to be remembered for one thing then it must be this: Our citizens are treated equally. There will be none who feel as if their lot in life is unfair or unjust, for this land is that of the workers. After all, Wallnut himself said: "I want everyone to celebrate, not just my friends!""

TBK_workers_self_management:0 "Self-Managed Production"
TBK_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The time has come to extend the authority of the local worker councils. They will receive an expanded authority over legal and industrial processes, making them an integral part of our federal system. The workers shall finally control the means of production in full!"

TBK_land_electrification:0 "Shining Lights"
TBK_land_electrification_desc:0 "The electrification of our roads and cities is a logical next step for our industrial efforts. Infrastructure is the key to any great societal advancement and so we shall ensure ours is prepared for generations of future industrial and technological progress!"

TBK_modern_amenities:0 "The Broadcasting Union"
TBK_modern_amenities_desc:0 "It was not particularly difficult to convince the few media broadcasting companies that operate in the nation to combine their efforts as part of a new union. Wallnut especially appreciates the sentiment to improve the quality of aired and printed material alongside the benefits for socialist education."

TBK_communal_housing:0 "Communal Standards"
TBK_communal_housing_desc:0 "Communal estates or 'union housing' will provide our few unfortunate citizens with the basic living standards that they need to survive should all else inexplicably be lost. Indeed, as they provide an environment where certain facilities are shared, Dusk Wane speculates that they may even help the residents develop a communal identity."

TBK_labour_federalism:0 "Essay On Labour-Federalism"
TBK_labour_federalism_desc:0 "An excerpt from the paper puts it best, 'Socialism and progress are in the hooves of the workers; a federation of workers with equal rights, both positive and negative, is the best possible state structure in which that progress can be achieved. I am beholden to the workers as much as they are to one another.'"

TBK_labour_consitution:0 "Federal Bill of Rights"
TBK_labour_consitution_desc:0 "The Federal Bill of Rights is not unlike other such legal documentation with regard to its general concept as a guarantor of individual rights and liberties. It is nevertheless different, enshrining additional rights like the right to protest and the right to work which many other 'progressive' state refuse to implement."

TBK_right_to_unionize:0 "Rights of Unions"
TBK_right_to_unionize_desc:0 "Such a fundamental part of our society and state cannot be exclusive or limited to the established unions, the right to unionise for any reason and for all individuals should be guaranteed and enshrined. With the blessing of Wallnut, Dusk Wane should have no issues passing this integral piece of legislations."

TBK_wealth_of_land:0 "Plow the Land"
TBK_wealth_of_land_desc:0 "State investments in the agricultural industries are a logical next step in our industrial development. More food means more surplus, which can give us some extra to export or provide a greater ceiling for potential population growth in the near future."

TBK_rural_industries:0 "Outback Factories"
TBK_rural_industries_desc:0 "Wallnut has been convinced that small factory districts for local communities are efficient and desirable for the general public so that they don't have to make long journeys into more traditionally developed parts of the country to contribute to the economic growth and industrial boom of the nation."

TBK_farming_mechanization:0 "Tractor Collectives"
TBK_farming_mechanization_desc:0 "Wallnut has been convinced that large agricultural collectives are to be established to better distribute the machines and land between workers. This collectivisation should ensure equal opportunity for all agricultural workers whilst retaining a more efficient use of undivided land."

TBK_dusk_factories:0 "To Feed the Workers"
TBK_dusk_factories_desc:0 "A hungry worker is an unhappy worker, as any hungry citizen is an unhappy citizen. We must feed the means of production if we wish for them to produce and to innovate in our rapidly advancing nation; they shall never again have to worry about having to feed an empty stomachs."

TBK_union_militias:0 "Union Militia"
TBK_union_militias_desc:0 "As of yet, unions that take the form of militia organisations are somewhat of a legal grey zone with their regards to jurisdiction and where the use of force is considered appropriate. We shall legalise and regulate the process of militia creation on the condition that they are beholden to the army in times of war."

TBK_elected_commanders:0 "Elected Commanders"
TBK_elected_commanders_desc:0 "The militia units are well known for the democratic process through which they elect their own leaders. This is yet another grey area which we shall codify as common and accepted practice, following the condition that in times of war the army is responsible organising these leaders and their forces."

TBK_work_dusk:0 "Union of Wallnut and Dusk"
TBK_work_dusk_desc:0 "After slow and careful consideration from our beloved Wallnut, Dusk Wane has convinced him that the logical course of action now is to bring him into his faction proper. To commemorate, Dusk has promised a party in the capital which even he shall attend, but more importantly he has ordered the media into overdrive in support of this move."

TBK_technological_industries:0 "Modern Industrial Production"
TBK_technological_industries_desc:0 "Technological progress under socialism is, in theory at least, utterly limitless. This is a fundamental tenet of our philosophy and so we will further the development of our lacking industrial equipment through imports, research funding and diligent work from scientists in order to further increase production."

TBK_electronics_industries:0 "Electronics Experiments"
TBK_electronics_industries_desc:0 "It seems there is more to the field of electronics than we first thought. With a dedicated research committee these machines may become our most valuable technological advancement, perhaps even leading the way to greater things than we can possibly imagine."

TBK_chemical_industries:0 "Synthetic Fuel"
TBK_chemical_industries_desc:0 "Whilst we are not necessarily opposed to trade with other nations, in the event of open war a home supply of oil and rubber may prove vital for our war machine. Wallnut in particular has expressed interest in these developments, citing his constant lack of resources as a warlord. Development and production will commence as soon as possible."

TBK_niftyn_start:0 "Legacy of Steel Stallion"
TBK_niftyn_start_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, Tobuck has become more than just another minor state in Zebrica. The work is far from done, however. Having convinced Wallnut to adopt a communist government, Niftyn must now create a vanguard to lead the newly formed United Lands of Northern Zebrica."

TBK_industrial_ministry:0 "Ministry of Industrial Production"
TBK_industrial_ministry_desc:0 "For a worker's paradise to be achieved it is imperative that we create the means within the state to enable them in their quest to enlarge the means of production and to advance it. With Wallnut's approval, Niftyn has formally established the Ministry of Industrial Production with which he will guide the workers to greatness."

TBK_workers_state:0 "State of Workers and Peasants"
TBK_workers_state_desc:0 "The federation is comprised almost entirely of workers and peasants. It is their nation, their land and their pride and the future which they are all striving to create. Greatness does not come to those who wait, it arrives precisely when the work is done in order to achieve it."

TBK_purge_parasites:0 "Values of Class Struggle"
TBK_purge_parasites_desc:0 "There can be no peace with those who oppose the ponytariat and the revolution. Corrupt politicians, decadent nations and dissidents to the perfect form of communism shall all be crushed in the boot of our inevitable progress."

TBK_estate_collectivization:0 "Estate Collectivization"
TBK_estate_collectivization_desc:0 "Large holdings of land, be they personal or for business, are to be seized and redistributed to the citizens of our great state at once. Wallnut is in agreement that, if all should own a large amount of land, then all shall celebrate together in joy."

TBK_ponytariat_ownership:0 "Ownership of the Ponytariat"
TBK_ponytariat_ownership_desc:0 "It is a fundamental tenet of the revolution that land should be given to the citizens of any communist state. Not only shall we put this into legal effect, but we shall additionally establish an economic commission to ensure that sectors of the economy cooperate for mutual benefit."

TBK_state_industrial_control:0 "Central Economic Directive"
TBK_state_industrial_control_desc:0 "The Federal Planning Commission has occasionally encountered difficulties when zoning areas for industrialisation thanks to other laws regarding the protection of certain land and buildings. We shall grant them greater powers to ensure that their work remains unhampered."

TBK_tobuck_arms_industries:0 "War-Economy Directive"
TBK_tobuck_arms_industries_desc:0 "To the delight of the Generalissimo, Niftyn has proposed a large expansion of military production to ensure that the state does not fall behind its neighbours in production capacity or stockpiles. The reactionaries shall not outgun us!"

TBK_artillery_production_bonus:0 "Red Star Artillery"
TBK_artillery_production_bonus_desc:0 "The affectionate title of 'Red Stars' originates from war stories that emerged after the victory against Chiropterra. In such low supply of ammunition, artillery was occasionally known to fire masses of flares into the sky or directly at the advancing enemy to stall for time. Though the story is indeed inspiring, perhaps it would be best to update and properly stock our artillery stores for future conflicts."

TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus:0 "New Model Battle Rifle"
TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus_desc:0 "Now that we are in a position to fund and improve on our previous designs, it has become apparent that our current stores of weapons are both old and worryingly diverse. Wallnut needed no convincing that a new and standardized weapon for the troops was necessary and Niftyn is happy to oblige."

TBK_niftyn_factories:0 "To Arm the Revolution"
TBK_niftyn_factories_desc:0 "In the unlikely event that our professional forces are overrun and defeated, it is the duty of the workers and peasants to pick up the slack. We will procure weapons for and train units of worker militia should they be needed in coming conflicts."

TBK_resource_aquisition:0 "Ministry of Industrial Resources"
TBK_resource_aquisition_desc:0 "With the threat of blockades and a significant risk of reactionary trade warfare, it is only logical that a ministry be established to ensure that resources can always be provided for our heavy industry. Needless to say, Wallnut has accepted Niftyn's proposal to assist war production with open hooves"

TBK_expand_steel_production:0 "Increase Steel Quotas"
TBK_expand_steel_production_desc:0 "Steel is perhaps the most important resource for the continued development of our burgeoning industry. For that reason, production quotas will be increased for the most efficient plants and said plants will receive funding in order to expand their operations."

TBK_manerba_aluminium:0 "Manerba Bauxite Mines"
TBK_manerba_aluminium_desc:0 "Manerba has an impressive supply of aluminium that remains yet untapped in spite of the sizable mining operation there. With some funding and a little additional equipment the workers will begin extracting yet more of our vast wealth of resources."

TBK_rapid_urbanization:0 "Ministry of Urban Development"
TBK_rapid_urbanization_desc:0 "In the modern era it is no surprise that modernising cities is a priority, but it has also become a very messy task thanks to the complexity of urban sprawl. To rectify this issue, Wallnut has signed off on Niftyn's proposal for a Ministry of Urban Development."

TBK_urban_fortifications:0 "Bunker and Shelters Directive"
TBK_urban_fortifications_desc:0 "With the introduction of aircraft into warfare, it is inevitable that bombers will try to reach our cities and tear them down. Though integrating an air defense network is impractical at this time, we can ensure that all future constructions made with hardier materials and that every building has a bunker."

TBK_federal_militia:0 "Federal Reserves"
TBK_federal_militia_desc:0 "These valiant workers and peasants are to be commended for their commitment to revolutionary ideals as part of their militia units. Unfortunately, militia organisations are notoriously unwieldy and may potentially represent a threat to both the state of the army; federal integration is the logical solution."

TBK_socialist_education:0 "Learn, Learn and Learn"
TBK_socialist_education_desc:0 "Wallnut has approved Niftyn's motion to begin an immense literacy campaign for the benefit of all. They must be able to lead themselves as we lead them now, for the revolution and for communism itself."

TBK_manual_lessons:0 "Hooves-On Education"
TBK_manual_lessons_desc:0 "There's nothing quite like a true hooves-on experience when it comes to industry and practical education. If we wish to train a new generation of workers and communists in the true trades of our state and ideology then it must be done properly."

TBK_marks_institute:0 "Caramel Marks Institute"
TBK_marks_institute_desc:0 "Though we have done much for the education system of the federation, the high achievers have thus far received little attention.

TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party:0 "Communist Party of Hazrumenia"
TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party_desc:0 "Though our faction by now already has incredible influence in the administration, it would be best to formalise this power for the sake of keeping up appearances. Soon Niftyn shall announce the creation of the Communist Party Harzrumenia, a party for every worker and peasant."

TBK_soviets_model:0 "Lessons of the Winter Revolution"
TBK_soviets_model_desc:0 "Centralisation of power is necessary for unity and efficiency within our worker's paradise.

TBK_communist_secret_police:0 "State Security Council"
TBK_communist_secret_police_desc:0 "Those that seek to extinguish the flame of the revolution both internal and external deserve no quarter.

TBK_state_mass_media:0 "The Truth"
TBK_state_mass_media_desc:0 "Mass media has long been an effective tool in swaying the population and with the introduction of radio it is now more accessible than ever.

TBK_expand_party_membership:0 "Join the Struggle, Worker!"
TBK_expand_party_membership_desc:0 "Unity through the masses may initially seem counter-intuitive, but the reality is that those we invite to the party will support it by default and Niftyn by extension. A recruitment drive is just what we need to ensure that divisions in the administration never even form in the first place."

TBK_orthodox_stallionism:0 "Orthodox Marksist-Stallionism"
TBK_orthodox_stallionism_desc:0 "Niftyn is a dedicated student of Marks and Steel Stallion. His dream for communism is the dream of the nation and of the workers; it shall be proliferated so that our great state may soon challenge the old order of decadence and reactionary thought, just as the great founders themselves dreamed."

TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference:0 "1st Party Conference of HCP"
TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference_desc:0 "Publicity has always been the ally of the revolution, with Niftyn taking extra care to ensure that he and Wallnut as its vanguard make the most use of it.

TBK_new_style_tobuck:0 "Metropolis of the Ponytariat"
TBK_new_style_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck has by now long been considered the centre for industrial and urban developments without our great state and the time has come to make the final steps towards the metropolis that all know it could become. It shall serve as a model for other cities within our federation as the beating heart of communism."

TBK_wallnut_stallionist:0 "The Steel Generalissimo"
TBK_wallnut_stallionist_desc:0 "Wallnut has done many great things for communism and for the creation of the federation. Niftyn and the party have seen fit to bestow the title of 'Steel Generalissimo' upon him to honour his service and commitment to the revolution; he has of course accepted with immense gratitude and with the intent to celebrate."

TBK_stalliongrad_south:0 "Stalliongrad of Zebrica"
TBK_stalliongrad_south_desc:0 "We are the home of the revolution in Zebrica and so we shall adopt a policy of ideological vanguardism on the continent. There are none that can hold such a magnificent and well-earned title as this and none that can take on the responsibilities that such an important position entails."

TBK_party_hq:0 "Headquarters of the Revolution"
TBK_party_hq_desc:0 "It is a great honour to die for one's ideal of communism. A propaganda wave centering on the enemies of that very ideal as a justification for coming conflicts will work wonders for the population's attitudes towards a large-scale war to be waged against the reactionaries."

TBK_control_militia:0 "Militia Commissars"
TBK_control_militia_desc:0 "It is finally time to remove the remaining semblances of independence that were granted to the militia divisions. Commissars will be assigned to their units and they will serve just the same as any other professional division, though they will of course remain portrayed as public militia for the sake of recruitment."

TBK_marksist_state:0 "Marksist-Stallionist Constitution"
TBK_marksist_state_desc:0 "It is finally time to draft a completed constitution for our worker's paradise. As Steel Stallion and Marks themselves knew, a centralised and powerful state is necessary to protect the rights of all workers and this all-important document will reflect that proven fact in its contents."

TBK_work_niftyn:0 "Party of Wallnut and Niftyn"
TBK_work_niftyn_desc:0 "After a significant amount of time spent in discussion, Niftyn has managed to convince Wallnut to officially join the communist party. It's not the sort of party that the Generalissimo is used to, but he's adapting well to his new role as the face and 'leader' of the revolution."

TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting:0 "Socialist Hazrumenia"
TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting_desc:0 "The time has come to solidify influence and codify ideals once and for all within the political factions of this great socialist state. The battle for the socialist dream is finally over."

TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy:0 "The Wallnut Declaration"
TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy_desc:0 "As the perceived leader and vanguard of the revolution, it is Wallnut's job to make all declarations regarding war and coming conflicts. The time has now come for such a declaration as we are finally ready to liberate the workers chained within the decadent societies that surround us."

TBK_territory_warzena:0 "Shatter the Crown of Warzah"
TBK_territory_warzena_desc:0 "The gormless monarchists of Warzena believe that their 'reforms' will save their decadent society from collapse; oh how wrong they are. We shall greatly speed up this process by tearing it down and rebuilding it ourselves."

TBK_drive_out_nobles:0 "End the Leopard Line"
TBK_drive_out_nobles_desc:0 "There remains another remnant of the Warzenan monarchy besides the previously ruling king. The Leopard dynasty is scattered and comparatively unimportant, but not powerless; it is imperative that we deal with them before the remnants of the monarchists flock to the old rulers of Warzena."

TBK_spread_collectivization:0 "Fresh Rural Collectives"
TBK_spread_collectivization_desc:0 "With the implementation of actual reforms in Warzena such as the proliferation of new rural collectives in the region, the zebras there will be far more agreeable once we have shown them the errors of their ways. This will no doubt speed up the integration of the region greatly."

TBK_communist_core_warzena:0 "Federal District of Mayrzim"
TBK_communist_core_warzena_desc:0 "A lot can be done with a little renaming and a lot of administrative restructuring; namely the complete incorporation of a once monarchist state into a socialist one.

TBK_internationale_connections:0 "The Global Struggle"

TBK_home_of_revolution:0 "Home of the Revolution"
TBK_home_of_revolution_desc:0 "Truly we are what Stalliongrad has not yet become after the passing of our ideological forefathers, a global stage upon which the revolution may be touted and given out freely. The decadent world shall tremble when faced with the might of the federation!"

TBK_assess_hippogriffia:0 "Assess Hippogriffia"
TBK_assess_hippogriffia_desc:0 "The hippogriffs represent perhaps the greatest threat to our great paradise. Their island is defensible, their military prowess renowned and their fighters feared; but they shall not best our revolution this day."

TBK_red_zumidia:0 "Red Zumidia"
TBK_red_zumidia_desc:0 "Zumidia is an integral component in reaching our natural borders and thus it shall be an integral part of the federation. None shall oppose our liberation of the workers that have languished for so long under hippogriffian tyranny."

TBK_colthage_defences:0 "North-Eastern Fortifications"
TBK_colthage_defences_desc:0 "Colthaginian rhetoric has continuously proven hostile no matter the regime in power. We are wise and wary of their designs on Zumidia and of their ambitions, making fortifications along the border a logical choice for our defensive strategy."

TBK_maregypt_war:0 "Return to the Source"
TBK_maregypt_war_desc:0 "Tobuck was originally built by the Maregpytians; they are as much our brethren as any creatures and shall not be forgotten by the federation or the Hazrumenian dream. Niftyn in particular has shown great interest in saving his homeland from decadence, but all concur that Maregypt shall be free!"

TBK_international_war:0 "Hazrumenian Liberation Front"
TBK_international_war_desc:0 "There's no more noble aim than to strive for the freedom of others and such is the policy we will adopt during our great battles to come; a policy and doctrine of socialist liberation against the reactionary forces that stand opposed to our inevitable victory!"

TBK_revolutionary_spearhead:0 "Revolutionary Spearhead"
TBK_revolutionary_spearhead_desc:0 "Armour is not simply a useful propaganda tool, but also an effective component of a modern fighting force. We can give the divisions in which they are used both a name and a true purpose in the revolution!"

TBK_territory_zarantia:0 "Scatter the Tribes"
TBK_territory_zarantia_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with the tribes that once shunned us, kicking Tobuck to the wayside in order to avoid the wrath of the Storm King all those years ago. The federation does not forget their treason, nor does it intend to allow Zarantia to persist."

TBK_end_sedentary_life:0 "Enforce Sedentary Life"
TBK_end_sedentary_life_desc:0 "Nomads are incredibly difficult to sway for a number of reasons, chief among them is that their society has no concept of a national identity or unifying ideology. If we wish to make progress with them, then we must settle them first."

TBK_end_old_hierarchies:0 "Abolish the Aguellid"
TBK_end_old_hierarchies_desc:0 "The tribal title of Aguellid no longer holds any meaning or relevance to our great nation. We shall abolish it to make way for more appropriate positions in government and the administrative restructuring of the region."

TBK_communist_core_zarantia_desc:0 "A lot can be done with a lot of administrative restructuring and careful reeducation; namely the complete incorporation of a once tribalistic 'state' into a socialist one.

TBK_guerilla_army:0 "Free Forces of Federation"
TBK_guerilla_army_desc:0 "If the warlord era has proven anything, it's that traditional warfare is not the future in armed conflicts. The size of a force is not necessarily a deciding factor in victory, particularly if we embrace the ideas of a decentralised command structure to maximise the effectiveness of individual commanders."

TBK_special_forces_focus:0 "Wallnut's Finest"
TBK_special_forces_focus_desc:0 "Since his warlord days, Wallnut has always had a soft spot for the special forces. Fortunately it is an affection worth investing in and thus funding has been allocated to improving their combat effectiveness."

TBK_shadow_strikes:0 "Shadow Strikes"
TBK_shadow_strikes_desc:0 "Force concentration is a defining feature of modern doctrine, which makes it something worth investing in.

TBK_call_of_duty:0 "Call of Duty"
TBK_call_of_duty_desc:0 "Every citizen of our great federation knows that for their way of life to survive they must make a personal effort for the good of the nation. Expanded access to recruitment centers should provide the army with plenty of new recruits."

TBK_book_irregular_warfare:0 "My Experiences On the Trail"
TBK_book_irregular_warfare_desc:0 "In what most consider a surprising move, Wallnut has published a memoir of his days as a mercenary leader. It's framed largely as a biographical novel, but every now and then an actually very useful method of conducting guerilla warfare can be found."

TBK_spread_officer_experience:0 "Experience Amongst Ranks"
TBK_spread_officer_experience_desc:0 "The time has come to give out some promotions to the most promising commanders. New blood will keep the wheels of innovation greased for decades to come!"

TBK_book_regular_warfare:0 "My Experiences As the Leader"
TBK_book_regular_warfare_desc:0 "To the shock of all who know him, Wallnut has published a memoir of his days as a mercenary leader. It's framed largely as a biographical novel, but from time to time an actually very useful method of planning offensives and defensives crops up."

TBK_federal_army:0 "United Federal Army"

TBK_modern_arms_technology:0 "Weapons of War"
TBK_modern_arms_technology_desc:0 "Wars are won through mind and materiel, one is worthless without the other. Though we take great pride in ourselves, our stockpiles have been found somewhat lacking; an update is clearly in order!"

TBK_refitted_army:0 "New Model Soldier"
TBK_refitted_army_desc:0 "A soldier with an outdated rifle is little more than a corpse in waiting. Further modernisation of infantry equipment is necessary for success in war and so procurement of a new standard weapon shall go ahead."

TBK_enforce_discipline:0 "Left, Right, Left!"
TBK_enforce_discipline_desc:0 "Though morale is important, discipline amongst the soldiery is what will allow them to secure victory after victory and improve the morale of those around them. The troops were always stronger than the legionnaires, now they shall be the strongest!"

TBK_mechanization:0 "Mechanized Columns"
TBK_mechanization_desc:0 "Mechanized infantry is a curious concept that has, as of yet, barely been explored. In theory it can improve both the mobility and survivability of our forces immeasurably, making it a particularly inviting area of research."

TBK_armour_investment:0 "Study Chiropterran Tanks"
TBK_armour_investment_desc:0 "The Chiropterrans didn't do a lot of things right, but war was one thing at which they were horribly efficient. Reclaiming and developing upon their designs will provide us with valuable theory on the use of armour as well as a potential production model."

TBK_baragzen_pledge:0 "Baragzen's Pledge"
TBK_baragzen_pledge_desc:0 "The 'reforms' in Warzena are an affront to the customs and laws that they replaced. Our lord, though absolute in his power, shall make a promise to restore and enshrine the rights and powers of the nobility, military and merchants to reclaim the glories of old."

TBK_king_protector_desc:0 "As a Warzenan royal, our lord is duty and bloodline bound to protect the ponies of Tobuck as his ancestors have time and time again throughout history; those who seek to encroach on their rightful land shall be expelled.

TBK_tobuck_custodianship:0 "The Custodianship"
TBK_tobuck_custodianship_desc:0 "Custodian of Tobuck is a medieval title which was adopted by previous rulers of Warzena that lorded over the majority-pony region. Our lord, as the ruler of the area in the modern era, will adopt this title to further cement his legitimacy."

TBK_courtly_advisors_desc:0 "As an integral aspect of pursuing royal favour, the nobles will be required to act as the eyes and ears of the Zamal in and around the royal court. They are to be his tools and his assitance in thanks for the special notice he gives them."

TBK_pardon_lmrd: "Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty"
TBK_pardon_lmrd_desc: "The LMRD was a ghastly organization, but that was because they lacked the Tsaritsa's guidance and spent their time on mad side-projects.

TBK_realm_expansion_plan: "Natural Borders"
TBK_realm_expansion_plan_desc: "The Chiropterran expansion plans were flawed, but only because of their lack of the Tsaritsa's guidance, rather than their intent. We will prepare a series of conquests to bring our neighbours into the fold, bringing much needed order to this chaotic land."

TBK_zarantia_integration_desc: "The Zarantians are known as an ungovernable people, but that is not so. Their confederal model can be coopted with a few promises and a few bribes to the right zebras, so long as we do not expect them to show more loyalty than simply paying their admittedly-low taxes and fighting in our armies."

TBK_zebra_cossacks: "Imperial Yasani"
TBK_zebra_cossacks_desc: "Zarantians have a strong mercenary tradition and a long history of nomadism. By recruiting select Zarantian tribes to serve as mobile border patrol units, affording them extra pay and the right to wear distinctive culturally-inspired uniforms, we can get a rapid-response force capable of bringing the most distant frontiers off our realm to heel."

TBK_nationalism: "Fidelity"
TBK_nationalism_desc: "Every subject of our realm must be true to their Tsaritsa, to their homeland, and to its traditions. It is only through a strict Fidelity to these things that a nation remains strong and free of decadence."

TBK_old_chiropterran_governance: "Territories of Old Order"
TBK_old_chiropterran_governance_desc: "Chiropterra is a proud and mighty land, with its own traditions of governance built up over a millennium of struggle and sacrifice. We will integrate it into our tsardom as the Realm of Chiropterra, and while there is much to be done to smooth out the contradictions in Chiropterra, we shall endeavour to leave as much of that venerable state intact as possible."

TBK_remnants_tobuck_government: "Ruins of Late Republic"
TBK_remnants_tobuck_government_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a wretched place, and not only because it was a republic. But against all odds, its denizens pulled through and won what was supposed to be an impossible victory. We will integrate them into our tsardom as the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, forever honoured as the people who delivered our Tsaritsa to her throne."

TBK_tsarist_order: "Her Imperial Sovereign's Lands"
TBK_tsarist_order_desc: "The Tsaritsa's rule extends not only to the people of Novaya Severyana, but to the soil as well. We will not collectivize as the red scum do, nor guarantee private property as the snivelling Harmonists do. All land in the Grand Duchy of Tobuck and the Realm of Chiropterra shall be legally owned by Tsaritsa Alesia, to be held and used by her assent."

TBK_tsaritsas_hoof: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof"
TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_desc: "The Nightmare's Hoof was one of the finest, if not the finest spy agency in the world. We should find the agents of this noble institution and recruit them back into the fold, so that the enemies of the Tsaritsa will never be able to keep secrets from her."

TBK_military_agents: "On Foreign Mansions"
TBK_military_agents_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on foreign intelligence, as the Nightmare's Hoof did before it. This will give us an edge in any future conflicts, whether against our neighbours or against the communist worms occupying Severyana."

TBK_public_purpose: "On Home Streets"
TBK_public_purpose_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on domestic surveillance. That way it can function as a powerful tool to root out corruption, dissent, and all other things which would weaken the state and the reign of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_codex_alesia: "Alesia Pravda"
TBK_codex_alesia_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has introduced a new code of laws to rationalize, streamline, and simplify the complex legal codes which have accumulated over the last milennium in Chiropterra, as well as bringing the once-lawless Grand Duchy of Tobuck in line with the standards of law and order of our realm."

TBK_labour_reform: "Issue of Labourers"
TBK_labour_reform_desc: "The Chiropterran Labourers do not fall neatly into our societal structure. Recognising this, the Tsaritsa now deliberates over what is to be done with this misbegotten caste of workers."

TBK_chiropterran_tone: "The New Homeland"
TBK_chiropterran_tone_desc: "Despite our differences, the Tsaritsa has seen it fit to induct members of the Chiropterran elite into her court. Their experience in economic centralism and social engineering on a mass scale make them uniquely qualified for our new administration."

TBK_autocracy: "Autocracy"
TBK_autocracy_desc: "Ultimate temporal authority must be invested in a single ruler, and it is irrevocable save by the decree of the Nightmare Herself. The great pyramid of authority must have a summit, and that summit must be a single autocrat, for a divided state cannot stand."

TBK_severyan_tone: "The Old Severyana"
TBK_severyan_tone_desc: "Thus far the expatriates from Severyana have proven themselves invaluable in the construction of the new administration. It is only fitting that they should be rewarded for their marvellous work and that we should further expand the repatriation program in order to facilitate future expansions of the state."

TBK_social_elements: "Elements of Imperialism"
TBK_social_elements_desc: "While the Equestrian Elements of Harmony are partially responsible for weakening Severyana and leaving it open to communism, the fundamental idea of enumerating a set of virtues as guiding principles for the state is a good one. We will enumerate our own set of "Elements," to act as the moral guides for the Tsaritsa's government."

TBK_element_order: "Element of Order"
TBK_element_order_desc: "The Element of Order refers to the fundamental value in obeying your superiors, following orders, and respecting the hierarchies you live under. It is distinct from the Equestrian Element of Loyalty because it does not orient itself around on personal connections, but around strict duties."

TBK_element_will: "Element of Will"
TBK_element_will_desc: "The Element of Will refers to the virtue to be found in imposing your will upon the world, and therefore lends itself naturally to the captains of industry as well as the high officials of state."

TBK_state_capitalism: "Charter of Corporatives"
TBK_state_capitalism_desc: "Whilst incredibly efficient, the economic model that the Chiropterrans have made extensive use of is not entirely appropriate for the subjects of the Tsaritsa. Much of the state-controlled industry shall be split between existing corporations with the intent to decentralise, if only slightly, the stratocratic methods of our new citizens."

TBK_military_industries_focus: "Arms For the Empire"
TBK_military_industries_focus_desc: "We will continue the Chiropterran policy of manufacturing only such consumer goods as are absolutely necessary. The bulk of our industry shall go towards supplying the legions."

TBK_establish_civilian_sector: "Products For the Subjects"
TBK_establish_civilian_sector_desc: "Our Tobuckian subjects are not used to the austere life the Chiropterran legionnaires lived. Accordingly, we will use some of our industry to manufacture consumer goods for our subjects to keep them happy, well-fed and prosperous."

TBK_element_honour: "Element of Honour"
TBK_element_honour_desc: "The Element of Honour refers to upholding the duties and dignity of one's station with upright zeal. It differs from the Element of Honesty in that the meaning of Honour is heavily dependent on your social station: the Honour of the labourer is to work, while the Honour of the soldier is to fight, and the Honour of the Tsaritsa is to rule."

TBK_crown_scouts: "Organisation of Moon Rangers"
TBK_crown_scouts_desc: "Chiropterran youth are largely left to their own devices, their parents and local youth programs entrusted to instill good values in them. While this worked well when Chiropterra was a thousand year old stratocracy, given recent cultural changes it would be best to centralize these youth programs to ensure they inculcate not only faith in The Nightmare, but also a zealous devotion to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_element_authority: "Element of Authority"
TBK_element_authority_desc: "The Element of Authority refers to the central importance of leaders to recognize their own right to lead, granted by the Tsaritsa, and not to shy away from doing what it takes to maintain proper hierarchy and respect for superiors."

TBK_loyal_education: "Faithful Curriculum"
TBK_loyal_education_desc: "Our school curricula must teach the true history of our tsardom: from the glory of old Severyana, to the fall at the hooves of the sun and the communists, to the parallel exiles of the Nightmare's Legions and the Tsaritsa herself, to the glorious present and the bright future."

TBK_diploma_program: "Imperial Diplomas"
TBK_diploma_program_desc: "We will standardise our higher education program, collecting the qualifications of our realm's best and brightest into a system of imperial diplomas. This will streamline scientific research significantly."

TBK_arch_enemy_communism: "Death To Marksism!"
TBK_arch_enemy_communism_desc: "There was one pony in history more evil than the usurper Celestia. Her name was Caramel Marks. Not only does her doctrine deny the Nightmare's right to rule, it denies monarchy itself and seeks to destroy all the noble traditions of this world. Marksists are anathema, and there is no higher honour than to destroy the red devils."

TBK_severyan_curriculum: "Severyan Language Act"
TBK_severyan_curriculum_desc: "Wer will fund new courses to teach Severyanian in our schools, with those who have completed Severyanian courses given a competitive edge in attaining promotions in the government and military."

TBK_table_nobility: "Ranks Of Nobility"
TBK_table_nobility_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has ordered a census of the noble families of Chiropterra, such that the accumulated privileges and duties of the last thousand years can be collected, defined, and standardized into a clear ranking scheme."

TBK_traditonal_social_order: "Traditional Social Order"
TBK_traditonal_social_order_desc: "For all the laudable discipline of their military hierarchy, Chiropterran civil society is distressingly egalitarian. Other than a few aristocratic families whose role is mainly honourary, the faithful are largely treated as equals. We must rectify this situation by codifying hereditary social castes with distinct rights and responsibilites, all working for the glory of The Nightmare and the Tsaritsa."

TBK_severyan_culture: "Love Of Severyana"
TBK_severyan_culture_desc: "Severyanian culture was a magnificent thing, blending together elegance and austerity, form and function, bombast and tranquility. That was before the usurper Celestia diluted it and the communist iconoclasts destroyed it. And yet it shall be again: we shall organize festivals and holidays to inculcate in our people a love of Severyana's traditions and beauty."

TBK_severya_primacy: "Severyana Above All!"
TBK_severya_primacy_desc: "Through hard work and careful social engineering, we have brought back Severyanian culture from the brink of extinction. Though the communists would see it slain, we have brought Severyanian traditions back, stronger than ever!"

TBK_spirit_of_alexander: "Spirit of\nAlexander Snezhinsky"
TBK_spirit_of_alexander_desc: "In honour of our glorious ancestor, we will raise two new "Snezhinskaya" divisions of Druzhina from the former legionnaires of mighty Chiropterra."

TBK_absolute_authority: "Her Will Be Done"
TBK_absolute_authority_desc: "As The Nightmare's chosen, Tsaritsa Alesia rules through divine right. Her word is the law of the land. Her every order shall be understood as the will of the realm, to be followed as unquestioningly as if The Nightmare Herself had willed it."

TBK_ursagrad_capital: "My Snezhnograd"
TBK_ursagrad_capital_desc: "Ursagrad occupies a key position between the Chiropterran Realm and the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, and its history as being founded by the Severyanian Ursa Legion would reinforce that aspect of our Tsardom's character. Many inhabitants even speak an ancient dialect of Severyanian. Tsaritsa Alesia shall make Ursagrad her capital, renamed in honour of her glorious ancestor Alexander Snezhinsky."

TBK_royal_patronage: "Arts Of the Court"
TBK_royal_patronage_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia does not hoard the wealth of the realm as Griffon kings do. She has taken it upon herself to uplift a new generation of patriotic artists with her patronage, so that the splendour of Novaya Severyana may be reflected in works of transcendent beauty."

TBK_royal_example: "Through Her Example"
TBK_royal_example_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has no tolerance for decadence or waste. While her palace shall be grand, its decorations shall be strictly devotional, and she herself shall be clad in an austere uniform at all times. Through her example, our subjects will learn to stay clear of the wastrel's vices."

TBK_court_tsaritsa: "Court of Stars"
TBK_court_tsaritsa_desc: "The Tsaritsa will set up a grand throneroom, where she will hold a magnificent court that one day will beggar even that of the usurper Celestia. Foreign dignitaries and Novaya Severyanian nobles alike will be in awe of the Court of Stars."

TBK_palace_estates: "Tsaritsy Polya"
TBK_palace_estates_desc: "We will develop the fertile lands around our palace as the personal demesne of the Tsaritsa. It will provide for her vast household, as well as covering a significant portion of the expenses of state."

TBK_severyan_customs: "Grand Winter Gala"
TBK_severyan_customs_desc: "The tsars of Old Severyana would host great galas on the longest night of the year. They would invite all the nobles and a few lucky commoners to their palaces, where they would put aside their differences and celebrate the beauty of winter and of the night. We shall revive this tradition, and invite the nobles of Chiropterra to pay homage to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare."

TBK_safeguard_communities: "Rights of Commoners"
TBK_safeguard_communities_desc: "Communist filth claim that by enforcing a class system we are guaranteeing poverty. Like everything else they say, this is a lie. The commoners shall be cared for, and so long as they fulfill their duties, they need never know hunger."

TBK_priviliges_aristocracy: "Duties of Aristocracy"
TBK_priviliges_aristocracy_desc: "In Griffonia, perhaps, or under the usurper Celestia, the aristocracy are lazy layabouts sucking the bloated corpse of the state. Not in old Severyana, not in Chiropterra, and not in Novaya Severyana. The aristocracy will have important martial duties to fulfill, with the lesser gentry fighting in the Legions and the higher nobles using their wealth to support the army."

TBK_imperial_bureaucracy: "Bureaucracy of the Tsardom"
TBK_imperial_bureaucracy_desc: "We will extend our bureaucracy to govern every portion of our realm, to ensure that all proceeds according to the will of the Nightmare and the command of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_resurrected_severyana: "Severyana Has Endured!"
TBK_resurrected_severyana_desc: "Against all odds we have not only preserved what we once thought lost in Severyana, but we have revived it in the most glorious fashion. The light of our homeland burns bright, fuelled anew by our revanchism and loyalty to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare!"

TBK_perfect_synthesis: "Perfect Synthesis"
TBK_perfect_synthesis_desc: "In spite of the great challenges we have faced, there now exists a unqiue and unbreakable bond between Chiropterran and Severyan culture and society. Though there is much left to be done, the Tsaritsa's loyal subjects will never again consider themselves separate; we have achieved an ideal unlike any other."

### Military post-tree

TBK_republic_armed_forces: "Army of the Republic"
TBK_republic_armed_forces_desc: "Tobuck was never really meant to act as a real country but here we are. We have nothing but bodyguards, mercenaries and scared conscripts next to a mish-mash of guns and not always assorted ammunition. Time to make an army out of it. But we'll manage. How hard can it all really be?"

TBK_construct_military_academy: "War College of Tobuck"
TBK_construct_military_academy_desc: "Well. Since we no longer rely on mercenaries and shall we say decentralized forces, we need to learn and teach how to maintain and organize an army. Now. We can't afford to go slow and meticulously build a proud and long-standing officer corp tradition. Time for some crash courses!"

TBK_quality_leadership: "Strength Through Quality"
TBK_quality_leadership_desc: "When in war, you need to learn what your strengths and vulnerabilities are. So while we are not that small of a country, we will be outnumbered. However, by focusing on training a good officer corps, we can make sure that our proficiencies in weaponry are used in the most efficient way possible. No waste of bullets or ponies!"

TBK_additional_manpower: "Fill the Ranks"
TBK_additional_manpower_desc: "When outnumbered, the best bet is to try and even the score. So there are more of them than there are of us but by the transitive properties of us knowing how to get our hooves on a lot of guns and ammos, we should be able to make sure that we kill enough of them so that we can take them! That's math. Who ever said that war was hard?"

TBK_magic_ponies: "War Can Be Magic Too!"
TBK_magic_ponies_desc: "Northern Zebrica is hardly a center of magical knowledge but we do have unicorns. Now granted, very few of them have even shown an inkling towards violence and normally, that would be good. However, we'll need to teach them to go from magical cake making to battlefield shield generation if we want to get an edge in the trenches."

TBK_radio_development: "Radio R&D"
TBK_radio_development_desc: "Our enemies have had years to prepare for an invasion and they'll have a slew of tactics to take us on. So we need to establish clear and excellent lines of communication for our units if we want to be able to adapt quickly and safely! Lucky for us, our smuggler friends know a thing or two about radio and encrypted communications!"

TBK_standard_rifles: "Commission New Battle Rifle"
TBK_standard_rifles_desc: "Now here's a conundrum, how do gun runners arm a standardized army? Well the answer is that it's a nightmare. You need factories, ammo, a supply line and all of it needs to be efficient with a much lower profit margin. But we made our bed and we need modern rifles if we want to kill whoever wants to lay in that bloody bed!"

TBK_new_leaders: "In Service Of the Republic"
TBK_new_leaders_desc: "With the warlords gone, we need to build up the Republican Guard and quickly. But more importantly, we need sane and loyal ponies to lead it. We're going to need to do a whole lot of performance review to find somepony capable in that sorry lot of an army. I mean, we are looking for the best of the best! Which is still a low bar here."

TBK_hire_griffonian_experts: "Hire Griffonian Instructors"
TBK_hire_griffonian_experts_desc: "When it comes to war, you can never go wrong with hiring some Griffonian veterans. That continent has been in turmoil ever since somegriff lost a trinket and Kemerskai broke everything. Some of them must surely be interested in working in a warmer climate for some exceptional pay. Just make sure the other officers don't learn how much."

TBK_establish_national_militia: "Rapid-Response Militia"
TBK_establish_national_militia_desc: "Not mentioning the internal risks to the republic, neither Zarantia, Warzena or Chiropterra can be described as being thrilled with us breathing. With such angry neighbours, we need. Let us set up local teams of minuteponies with some basic training and equipment to hold off the enemy until the army can arrive on the battlefield."

TBK_plan_militia_resistance: "Militia Battle Order X1"
TBK_plan_militia_resistance_desc: "The minuteponies can only do so much and so we need to accept that they'll fold if the army is delayed in any way. So let's work with that knowledge. Rather than sell an idea of fighting to the death to simple citizens, we'll instruct them to disperse before it's too late, disturb enemy movements and support refugees so as to not clog the roads and bridges."

TBK_army_grand_battleplan: "Central Army HQ"
TBK_army_grand_battleplan_desc: "The entire Republic rests upon a single center of command. If Tobuck falls, there is no hope of falling back. Therefore, our entire military doctrine must be to delay, stop and destroy anything that is on its way towards the capital. "

TBK_proper_trenches: "Shovel In Every Hoof"
TBK_proper_trenches_desc: "They say that there are two kinds of ponies: those who dig and those who have a gun. What they forget is that there's a third kind of pony: the one who pays. So you get both a shovel and a gun and if you want to live, you better dig those trenches like there's no tomorrow! We're not running a playground here!"

TBK_special_engineer_training: "Special-Engineer Courses"
TBK_special_engineer_training_desc: "It turns out that simply digging trenches is not as easy as it sounds like. There's a whole art in standardizing them and making them fit for combat, housing and logistical support. We better start selecting a few lucky ponies who will get the prized honor of supervising others doing the digging."

TBK_fortification_program: "Fortress-Republic"
TBK_fortification_program_desc: "Tobuck was never in the spot of defending itself and it shows. We won't be safe without some massive investment into our infrastructure. We need military depots, casemates, forts in any strategic positions and most importantly, the means of moving our troops and equipment around quickly and efficiently."

TBK_killzone_tactics: "Killzone Tactics"
TBK_killzone_tactics_desc: "With our limited supply of soldiers, we will have holes in our lines but we can transform this weakness into a strength by drawing our enemies in less defended open fields where we can blaze them from our stronger positions and then mop them up using our few mobile units."

TBK_masterwork_trenches: "Impenetrable Defence"
TBK_masterwork_trenches_desc: "We have a solid basis but we need to do more if we want to have any chance of withholding a major offensive. Send concrete to the trenches. Plant landmines in the killzones. Improve coordination between the artillery and the field engineers. Make every inch of terrain a Tartarus to go through! The line must hold!"

TBK_army_superior_firepower: "Battlefield Destruction"
TBK_army_superior_firepower_desc: "The Republic was born in a pile of guns surrounded by ponies who knew how to use them. This is where we came from and this will be how we prevail through the worst of storms! More guns. More firepower. And make sure they'll only pry them from our cold dead hooves!"

TBK_introduce_cannons: "Discard the Bombards"
TBK_introduce_cannons_desc: "Too many of our soldiers are still accustomed to old artillery pieces better suited for a museum than for the battlefield. It's partly on us as Pea Shooter ordered the best cannons to be sold internationally. Well, that's over. Soldiers? Forget about blackpowder, smoke and cannonballs. Meet the shell and the howitzer. Ain't they a beauty?"

TBK_anti_armor_aid: "Pierce All Armour"
TBK_anti_armor_aid_desc: "The tank is all the range nowadays. It'll be a long time for us to have the industry to produce them reliably for domestic use. However we can learn how to penetrate them. And if we do, that's where we'll be happy to be a small country. There'll be no going around for them. So let's wreck some armor!"

TBK_endless_steel_rain: "Explosive Forecast"
TBK_endless_steel_rain_desc: "A good cannon can hit a target and kill it. A better cannon will hit multiple targets at once and make sure that they're either dead or unfit for combat. And that my friends is how a small country negates the power of demographics. Hey, you! I hope you brought an umbrella!"

TBK_chemical_deterrence: "Chemical Deterrence"
TBK_chemical_deterrence_desc: "At some point in time, in a wretched place, the very worst of matchmakers had the idea of bringing chemistry and ballistics together. However, in Tobuck, we've learned to make the best out of the worst and we'll be damned if we're not making good use of anything that makes our guns deadlier. Now, carry those barrels with care."

TBK_proud_army: "Proud Foals of \nthe Republic"
TBK_proud_army_desc: "It was a difficult endeavour but we've never been afraid of difficulties. Now, a new generation of ponies is entering the barracks of the Republican Army of Tobuck and what they are finding isn't a slapped-together mess anymore. The era of warlords is well and truly over. Now stands an army, proud and strong!"

TBK_warlords_army: "Warlords of Tobuck"
TBK_warlords_army_desc: "Hey, warlords aren't so bad. Keep 'em paid, keep 'em armed, and they'll fight for anycreature, even a crook like Vasile. Pea's problem was he was a cheapskate who paid them all ad hoc and never signed a decent contract. That won't be an issue for us."

TBK_army_mobile_warfare: "Relentless Pursuit"
TBK_army_mobile_warfare_desc: "A decentralised mercenary force can move as fast as tartarus if given the right incentives. No need for elaborate chains of command, just offer a bonus to the first ones to the fight, and to any lower-level officer who shows daring and initiative. Boom. Instant blitzkrieg."

TBK_increase_military_production: "State Military-Industrial Complex"
TBK_increase_military_production_desc: "We need some proper factories if we're gonna make all this equipment. Yes, it'll be expensive, but absolutely nothing has a higher long-term profit margin than weapons."

TBK_trucks_galore: "Faster Than Anypony"
TBK_trucks_galore_desc: "You know what's faster than a speeding pegasus? A speeding truck. Let's motorize as much of our army as we can. It'll let 'em maneuver faster it'll let 'em carry more gear, and it'll let 'em carry off more loot once the fighting is done. So long as they give us a cut for the truck..."

TBK_add_armour_to_trucks: "Protect the Engines"
TBK_add_armour_to_trucks_desc: "Bullets and gasoline don't mix. Fortunately, we have a lot of scrap metal and a lot of ponies who'd be willing to do some dubiously-safe welding work for a quick buck. Who said making armoured vehicles was hard?"

TBK_get_some_tanks: "Hire the Gryphon Company" 
TBK_get_some_tanks_desc: "There's armoured vehicles, and then there's proper armour. For that, we gotta pay. Fortunately, Vasile has some contacts in Griffonia who have some proper hardware. Let's see if the bats and their fancy training can get through this..."

TBK_raider_trucks: "Leave ´em In Dust!"
TBK_raider_trucks_desc: "Our mercenaries have really taken to these trucks! They've given them names, spraypainted all sorts of things on them, and upgunned them well beyond the bounds of common sense. Firepower, mobility, and a symbol to rally around: what's not to love?"

TBK_army_mass_assault: "Lust For Loot"
TBK_army_mass_assault_desc: "If there's one thing Tobuck has a limitless supply of, it's greed. They've all seen how rich you can get off scavenging and gun-running, so if we give them the cheapest guns we can find and then promise to let them pick their foes (and their friends!) clean, we'll barely have to pay 'em!"

TBK_actual_guns: "Locked and Loaded"
TBK_actual_guns_desc: "So what if Pea Shooter sold most of the Storm King's old guns? Who needs 'em? I heard you can put together a submachine gun out of piping and sheet metal in a backyard welding shop. Oh, fine, we'll also buy some rifles. What is Tobuck coming to that we have to import weapons?"

TBK_abundant_recruits: "Everyone's a Mercenary"
TBK_abundant_recruits_desc: "Can you hold a gun? Would you hold this one? Would you stand over there and shoot anypony who comes near for a few bits? Congrats, you're a mercenary! Who knew recruitment could be so simple?"

TBK_frenzied_horde: "Drugs and Booze For All!"
TBK_frenzied_horde_desc: "You mix some old-fashioned black powder into rum, that's pirate's brew. You mix some smokeless powder and cocaine, that's brown-brown. You drink some pirate's brew and snort some brown-brown, you'll be the most fearless pony alive!"

TBK_glory_to_deluge: "What's Yours Is Mine!"
TBK_glory_to_deluge_desc: "We're declaring open season on the enemy's... everything. The promise of unrestricted plunder will attract more lowlifes and rabble to our army, and nothing's more dangerous than a low-life with a gun and a motive."

TBK_victory_celebrations: "Endless Triumphs"
TBK_victory_celebrations_desc: "Hired guns love being told they've done a good job. We'll festoon them with medals, shower them with booze, and pretty soon our army will have the best morale in Zebrica!"

TBK_bring_abord_new_folk: "The Warzenan Fellows"
TBK_bring_abord_new_folk_desc: "What's better than a mercenary band willing to work for you? A mercenary band with an infamous leader who's willing to work for you, that's what! This 'Captain Z' might need some time to adjust, but new blood is always welcome!"

TBK_gather_weapons: "Grab All the Guns"
TBK_gather_weapons_desc: "There's more than enough guns still stashed in Tobuck to arm our forces, we just have to find them. Search the houses, order of the president. Search the sewers, the junkyards, search and grab every firearm and every bullet you can find!"

TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths: "Knick-Knack Smiths"
TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths_desc: "Mercenaries love their weapons, and they love personalising and customising them. Some spend so much time on their weapons, they become better gunsmiths than the actual gunsmiths! We should offer these fellows new jobs,away from the front lines, making weapons for their old squadmates."

TBK_capture_machines: "Grab Some Vehicles"
TBK_capture_machines_desc: "We've got cutpurses, we've got congriffs, we've got bandits, and soon enough we'll have carjackers too! We'll send our troops out to "acquire" some vehicles, doesn't matter the condition, and refurbish them into supply trucks and troop transports."

TBK_organised_scavenging: "Organised Scavenging"
TBK_organised_scavenging_desc: "Why make when you can take? We will gather the gunsmithing gurus of the mercenary bands together, and create a set of manuals on how best to scavenge and refurbish captured equipment, whether you got it from the enemy or a scrapheap or your own grandmother."

TBK_mercenaries_command: "All-Mercenaries Command"
TBK_mercenaries_command_desc: "Our troops are enthusiastic, but it takes more than enthusiasm to win wars. We'll have to organize them into a centralized command structure if we want to pull of anything but the most rudimentary of operations."

TBK_payment_policy: "Specify Payment"
TBK_payment_policy_desc: "We have a lot of mercenary contracts, and the last thing we want is to accidentally break one of them through carelessness. That's how you get shot. We'll gather together the bookkeepers of the republic's bureaucracy and some of our old money launderers to keep track of all these contracts, making sure our payments are on-time and dependable."

TBK_drive_up_recruitment: "Enlist Now To the Free Forces!"
TBK_drive_up_recruitment_desc: "Why die for patriotism when you can die for money? Okay, that's a bad way of putting it, but it's the core of our sales pitch. Soldiers of more legitimate states struggle to get by and have to follow rigid discipline. In Tobuck, you get all the benefits of going bandit without anycreature calling you a bandit! Not to your face at least."

TBK_hill_warfare: "Hire the Tefe-Band"
TBK_hill_warfare_desc: "Mountain specialists? Well, Tobuck doesn't have many mountains... Ah well, they'll probably be useful for something in the future; let's hire them and get what expertise we can!"

TBK_jungle_warfare: "Hire the Zhevestes"
TBK_jungle_warfare_desc: "Jungle runners will certainly have their uses in the... The very expansive jungles of Tobuck. Hmm. Well, guerrilla warfare experts are always welcome here; let's bring them into our big mercenary family!"

TBK_desert_warfare: "Hire the Zodh Duners"
TBK_desert_warfare_desc: "Now, desert raiders are going to really help us out. Frankly it's incredible that we hadn't hired creatures with skills already, but there's no time like the present to finally plug a hole in our forces' capabilities!"

TBK_gather_shared_experiences: "Shared Tales and Pains"
TBK_gather_shared_experiences_desc: "If there is one thing that can be garnered from pain and suffering, it is how to avoid experiencing it a second time. We can learn a lot from our soldiers and their commanding officers, and so we should if we want to ensure they don't all die to more conventional armies."

TBK_some_equipment_standartisation: "Bring Old Units Up-To-Date"
TBK_some_equipment_standartisation_desc: "Whilst our current guns are good enough, they can be better. Why not figure out how these new weapons work and then make them ourselves, or use their parts to improve our stockpiles? better guns means a cleaner payday after all!"

TBK_rough_scarred: "The Rough and \nScarred Scum"
TBK_rough_scarred_desc: "What we lack in profressionalism we make up for in experience and our soldiers have the scars to prove just how much they've seen and done. Our bands are mighty regiments of battle-hardened soldiers, inspiring fear in their enemies with their brutality and discipline."

### Air Force tree

TBK_air_force_start: "First Air-Platoon"
TBK_air_force_start_desc: "Just because Tobuck was known for having lots of guns doesn't mean that we can't try to do other things with them! If we can find some planes and tape our guns to them, suddenly we'll have a real airforce!"

TBK_air_superiority_focus: "Battles In the Clouds"
TBK_air_superiority_focus_desc: "With our fledgling airforce, it is important that we train our pilots to choose their battles. Prioritize picking off the weaker enemy aircraft and avoiding the line of fire from stronger ones, and not only will they live to see another day, but they'll get better at completing their missions too!"

TBK_ground_support_focus: "Assault From Above"
TBK_ground_support_focus_desc: "Shooting down to the ground is just as important as shooting at other planes. Our future CAS pilots must undergo some additional training in order for their duties to be performed in an acceptable manner."

TBK_cas_planes: "Close-Air Support Designs"
TBK_cas_planes_desc: "Of course, all the training in the world will do no good if there's no plane for our specialized pilots to fly. We've managed to scrounge up some blueprints to a basic support plane. With some study, maybe our engineers can build a better one in the future."

TBK_aquire_more_fighters: "Establish Additional Squadrons"
TBK_aquire_more_fighters_desc: "Whilst it pains the treasury to spend money even at the worst of times, if we are to create an airforce from near-scratch then we must purchase planes to fill the ranks. At least we can probably get them on credit and barely notice a dent in the coffers!"

TBK_naval_bombers: "Green Bay Bomber Wing"
TBK_naval_bombers_desc: "Unfortunately for us, one of the things we may have to worry about is having our ports blockaded. Coincidentally, one of our engineers has come up with quite the solution: A new type of bomber designed specifically to destroy ships."

TBK_air_academy: "Air Weapon Tactics"
TBK_air_academy_desc: "What luck! A former "laborer" from Chiropterra has approached us and claimed that she used to be one of the best pilots in Equestria of all places. She's asked for safe passage back to her homeland. [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to do this, but in exchange, she will give some lessons to our pilots."

TBK_bomber_developments: "Bomber Plane Designs"
TBK_bomber_developments_desc: "There's been a new development lately: According to one of our advisors, a huge focus of our neighbors has been on developing better and more devastating bombers. After hearing of this, [FROM.GetLeader] has ordered that we also focus on designing better bombers so that we do not get left behind."

TBK_air_force_final: "Aces of Northern Zebrica"
TBK_air_force_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling air force! We've even begun to attract some aviation experts from other countries. We have come a long way in such a short time, but there's still much more to learn as we continue building a proper air force. At least our pilots can match the skill of our more developed neighbors."

TBK_air_assembly_line: "State Aircraft Company"
TBK_air_assembly_line_desc: "Surprisingly enough, a fledgling business devoted to aviation has popped up recently. Perhaps with some investment, we could convince them to help maintain our planes. Some of our aircraft have had some trouble holding themselves together mid-flight anyways."

TBK_radar_development: "R.A.D.A.R"
TBK_radar_development_desc: "Radios, communication of the future! And apparently great for getting an idea of what the enemy is up to, as well! Maybe we could get a few of these fancy new towers built around Tobuck if someone bothered to make some blueprints for them."

### Navy Tree

TBK_navy_start: "Piers of Tobuck"
TBK_navy_start_desc: "What do you mean our docks were only meant for trade? That's preposterous, the Storm King had used Tobuck as a weapons depot, it's only sensible that our shipyards be used for war as well."

TBK_cruiser_focus: "Open Maneuver Plans"
TBK_cruiser_focus_desc: "It's especially important in naval warfare to know who is doing what since the stakes are so high at sea. A few classes for our aspiring seafarers should help keep them coordinated so that they can better navigate around and protect one another."

TBK_submarine_focus: "Beneath the Waves"
TBK_submarine_focus_desc: "Shooting your enemy from afar is preferable. Shooting them while they can't see you is better. If our sailors can keep both of these tactics in mind, we will surely come out victorious in any engagement!"

TBK_naval_academy: "Cadet Academy"
TBK_naval_academy_desc: "It has come to our attention that very few of our seafarers actually possess the know-how to properly run a ship. Like it or not, they'll have to sit down and learn a few things if they want to sail the seas."

TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion: "Grand Naval Shipyards"
TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion_desc: "As we build more and more ships, we've begun to attract some of our citizens who hadn't shown any interest in the seas until recently. If we give them a place to work and some lessons to go with it, we'll have some of the finest shipwrights in Zebrica, maybe even the world."

TBK_battleship_designs: "Floating Fortress"
TBK_battleship_designs_desc: "As we make progress towards establishing our navy as a formidable force, the need for capital ships to spearhead them has become increasingly apparent. We don't expect to make many, but it would be an insult to our population if we didn't at least try."

TBK_destroyer_designs: "Small Ship Designs"
TBK_destroyer_designs_desc: "Destroyers! They make up the bulk of most navies, and ours will be no exception. First though, we'll need to actually put together a decent design for one. Somewhat recently, a destroyer from Maregypt had wrecked itself near our coastline. Maybe we can study that."

TBK_submarine_designs: "Submarine Hulls"
TBK_submarine_designs_desc: "Submarines! The silent killers of the sea. They're infamous for the amount of damage they can inflict upon bigger ships. It only makes sense that we should invest in them, seeing as some of our neighbors have larger navies than ours."

TBK_cruiser_design: "High Seas Aircraft Deployment"
TBK_cruiser_design_desc: "Land-based airports have their uses, but mobile airports, ones that we can launch air raids from at nearly any location? Those can be incredibly useful. The fact that they can be heavily armored is a huge bonus. We still need to design them, of course."

TBK_navy_final: "Rule the Waves"
TBK_navy_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling navy! We've come a long way in such a short time, but there's still more to learn and discover as we become a real player in the sea. At the very least, our sailors can go hoof-to-hoof with the very best from across the world."

He's a little green, but he's got the spirit and the brains.

Vasile has wisely distanced himself from the judicial trial since he himself is one such stooge. The judge is his choice. however, just to be sure. But as the trial concurs, the investigator at charge of the entire case asks the judge to pen a formal request to Equestria to imprison Pea Shooter.

### Wallnut events

tobuck_wallnut.1.t:0 "Who's Gonna Help Me?"
tobuck_wallnut.1.d:0 "He had to get rid of one of them, that was the hard part. Making friends was fun and having to dispose of any of them was a hard choice, but it was a choice he had to make.\n\nWallnut, usually never one for files and papers, was sat at a new desk with his hooves up; brow furrowed at the two dossiers in front of him. Baragzen and Alesia, the two exiles. One from another country, the other from another continent. Sure they were monarchists and pretty traditional folks, but he was nothing if not open to even the most disparate creatures. They were all warlords, at least they had bonded over that.\n\nOf course the difficult decision remained, in spite of his musings. He needed one friend and one enemy to make sure his government kept itself upright, work with one and target the other. The zebra appreciated a good party, but the earth pony was witty and fun to talk to; in different ways they all got on like a house on fire.\n\nWallnut sighed and set down the dossiers with an uncharacteristic malaise about him. Who would he keep around to set against the other?"
tobuck_wallnut.1.a:0 "Alesia could console him afterwards."
tobuck_wallnut.1.b:0 "Baragzen would lift his spirits with festivities."

tobuck_wallnut.2.t:0 "Who's Gonna Help Us?" #Podrick
tobuck_wallnut.2.d:0 "It was early afternoon in The Salty Baron, a popular pub on the Tobuckian coastline near the border to Chiropterra. Being in such close proximity to those fanatics often led to interesting conversations about what went on beyond the warning signs tentatively scattered along the coast. \n\n"I hear they sacrifice zebras to their night gods!" Yelled one stallion, swinging a beer around to exaggerate his claim. \n\n"Oh yeah? I hear they summon monsters to foalnap our children in the middle of the night!" Shouted another, stumbling out of her chair. \n\nSoon the locals quickly became hysterical with their fears and claims of all the horrible going-ons inside of Chiropterra, despite the best attempts of the bartender to calm everyone down. Just as the bartender was about to consider extreme measures, he spotted something that made his heart drop into his stomach: a well-dressed thestral accompanied by a small entourage of armed ponies had entered his pub. A warlord's company, no doubt. For now, they seemed to be observing the chaos unfold.\n\nA voice in the crowd rose higher than the others, "Yeah! This place is done for! Who's gonna help us when the Chiropterrans come knocking to enslave us and our kin?!" \n\nThe thestral grinned, then spoke with a charismatic upturn, "Why, me of course!" \n\nMost of the pub turned to the stranger who had entered. Some were bewildered, others suspicious. "And who are you supposed to be?" One asked. \n\n"Lemme tell ya somethin'," said the thestral as he hopped onto one of the tables, "All the stories you were sayin' about Chiropterra? All true. Every one of 'em. I know this cause I, Wallnut Drive, escaped their clutches years ago. And that means there ain't nopony better suited to protect ya from them than me." \n\nWhether it was because of the alcohol or Wallnut's charming grin, the crowd seemed to accept his reassurances, much to the bartender's relief."
tobuck_wallnut.2.a:0 "Maybe he really does know what he's doing."

tobuck_wallnut.3.t:0 "Victory's Reward"
tobuck_wallnut.3.d:0 ""As you can see Generalissimo, the legionnaires of Chiropterra have fled into... uh, sir? Should we come back later?"\n\nWallnut stood still as his tailor was measuring him for a new uniform. "Nonsense! Continue, please." He insisted with a grin. He'd been hearing nothing but good things about his forces lately, and so he had decided to get a snazzy new outfit to celebrate his inevitable triumph. His lieutenants couldn't help but wonder why he had decided to do this in the war room of all places.\n\nSaid lieutenants briefly exchanged looks, then one of them continued, "Well sir, the remainder of Chiropterra's forces have fled into the countryside. Their leadership and command structure collapsed when we took their cities, and for the most part the cities themselves are fully intact. However, the majority of the armouries and arms silos were demolished before we could get to them, and-"\n\n"Hold that thought," interrupted Wallnut. He frowned, looking at the map of Chiropterra on the central table. A moment later, his eyes brightened up and he flashed a smile towards his lieutenants. "Is that one big hotel in the capital still intact? I think it was called the Dreamscape."\n\n"Uh, it should be? New Ayacachtli is relatively untouched. But I don't see how that's-"\n\n"Secure it immediately." Wallnut clasped his hooves together in excitement, much to the annoyance of his tailor who was still trying to get measurements.\n\nIf his lieutenants were confused before, they were now completely befuddled. "With all due respect, sir... why?"\n\nWallnut's grin grew wider and wider as his imagination went wild, "Because all victories need to be celebrated, of course. I have just the plan for it too...""
tobuck_wallnut.3.a:0 ""I'll host a party!""

tobuck_wallnut.4.t:0 "Two Old Thinkers"
tobuck_wallnut.4.d:0 "The celebrations had gone on long into the night, to the point that some of the older folks were finding it hard to sleep. Dusk Wane was one such individual. His bones ached as he stepped out of the luxurious bed that had been provided for him. Surprisingly enough, being one of Chiropterra's less popular Moonspeakers had earned him an invitation to stay in the most expensive hotel the warlord could find. Though he found the apostate's blatant disregard for the Nightmare's teachings to be heretical, he couldn't help but feel that the young stallion was simply misguided and that it wasn't too late for the warlord to change his ways. \n\n"Can't sleep either, comrade? Or is that not a suitable term?"\n\nDusk gingerly rubbed his eyes. In the hall was an elderly earth pony smoking a cigarette. Dusk recalled seeing him a few times before, some old irredeemable marksist from Maregypt. Niftyn was his name, right? "These younger folks have more energy than I thought possible. I need some air so if you don't mind, I'll be on my way."\n\nNiftyn shook his head, "You'll find it difficult to find a quiet place here, Dusk. I've known Wallnut for a long time. Every corner of this place will be lively until they all collapse from exhaustion."\n\n"Then why don't you go join them, 'comrade'? This hall could be a little less lively as it is."\n\n"I was never one for celebrations that do not include the poor and impoverished," Niftyn took a puff of his cigarette, "There are still quite a lot of those here in Tobuck, far outside of the luxury of this hotel."\n\n"There's far..." Dusk almost raised his voice, but then realized that he actually agreed with the other stallion's statement. He stepped over to rest against the same wall as Niftyn, sighing deeply, "Yes. Maybe we can agree on one thing." Dusk glanced over to the other stallion, who was holding out another cigarette; a truce of sorts. Dusk chuckled and accepted it. "Maybe two things.""
tobuck_wallnut.4.a:0 "Comrades can be found even in the strangest places."

tobuck_wallnut.5.t:0 "Nervous Plans"
tobuck_wallnut.5.d:0 "The cup of coffee in Bean Counter's hooves looked as though it was about to be dropped at any moment. Both he and Home Brew were more than a little concerned for their own safety, but at least the latter wasn't a complete nervous wreck.\n\nThe less anxious of the two stallions tried to offer kind words, “Hey, come on. We'll be fine. A couple of stops on the way and we're out before the sun sets; nothing will happen to us.”\n\n“I-It's not...” Bean started, immediately needing to catch his breath before continuing. “Waiting m-makes it... w-worse...” He managed after a moment.\n\nGiven the very real risk that they could be shot as traitors for the duration of their wait, that was reasonable. Luckily they were unlikely to be recognised, so long as Wallnut himself didn't trott into the café they were trying to relax in.\n\n“Ain't much worse than waiting, I couldn't agree more!” A familiar voice gave out loudly.\n\nOh no.\n\nBean jumped out of his fur coat and pressed himself against the wall of their booth whilst his friend simply stared wide-eyed at their unexpected guest. He was right there, right in front of them. Did he come in here to get something on the way back to the palace? At this point it seemed more likely that the universe simply wanted to spite them.\n\n“All good? You both look like you've just fallen head-first into Tartarus!” The Generalissimo added, unbothered by their utter terror. “Well, was just lookin' for you two; I've got a party lined up for us all at some fancy hotel. I'll see you both there, eh?”\n\nAnd just like that, he was gone as soon as he had appeared. The two remaining and utterly mortified ponies looked at one another with complete understanding."
tobuck_wallnut.5.a:0 "Now was a good chance to get out."

tobuck_wallnut.6.t:0 "Jumpy Arrival"
tobuck_wallnut.6.d:0 "This was a terrible idea. At least, it felt like a terrible idea. To be fair he hadn't had much choice when the car and an armoured transport full of soldiers had turned up to his temporary residence, but it didn't make Carrot Stick any more comfortable. Just because they hadn't explicitly forced him into the vehicle didn't mean this wasn't some sort of trap, though equally he could believe that Wallnut was throwing some sort of 'party' at the expense of thestral dignity.\n\nA few more minutes of watching the world go by out of the tinted windows and they had arrived at the hotel, only to be greeted by the pony himself.\n\n“Well if it ain't Carrot Stick! How've you been since we saw each other last?” The warlord asked gleefully, trotting over without a care in the world.\n\nOf course they'd never actually met, what with Wallnut being a traitor and an apostate, but they had known of each other for many years. Unfortunately the civil servant was very far from fond of the mercenary commander despite his unusually reformist outlook on governance. He simply said nothing and sighed; letting his head hang slightly.\n\n“Well, lemme know if you want anything before the celebrations start. I'll be inside if you need me.” The rebel offered with surprising humility, at least making an effort towards reconciliation.\n\nAnother car, similarly escorted, had arrived and unloaded as the Generalissimo casually trotted away. Rose Rain looked just as unnerved as Carrot, which was why they drifted towards one another as they slowly made their way inside the hotel.\n\n“He could do so much for this place, but his first port of call is to party.” The mare gave out, clearly as disappointed by the host as she was confused and annoyed.\n\nHe hadn't intended to speak to anyone here, but that comment had caught the thestral off guard. “Quite. All that power and charisma, wasted on alcohol and music.”\n\n“A Chiropterran statespony agreeing with a harmonist... Small world, huh?”\n\nAt that, Carrot Stick smiled."
tobuck_wallnut.6.a:0 "Nothing like making new friends."

tobuck_wallnut.7.t:0 "The Next Morning"
tobuck_wallnut.7.d:0 "The sunlight alone was agony for some, though the noise of anarchy that subsequently found its way into the barely-awake ears of the partygoers. Even the ones that were still up and at it - though they were few and far between - finally had to take a moment and adjust as the real world came and tore them away from their drunken stupor.\n\nHere? Already? Guests had begun to get up and get out with some staff helping them and their unbearable hangovers whilst others were trying to keep them inside. Some scuffles broke out, the outside of the hotel was utter chaos and Wallnut was nowhere to be found.\n\nThose that had half a mind to save more than just themselves tried to look for him, but apparently he had disappeared into thin air. The average lieutenant and businesscreature were barely even awake, let alone coherent enough to make a proper search party.\n\nHowever, by chance, there were some guests that were not experiencing the aftereffects of a long night of partying and drinking; the Generalissimo was eventually found by..."
tobuck_wallnut.7.a:0 "Dusk Wane and Niftyn in the cellar wine storage."
tobuck_wallnut.7.b:0 "Carrot Stick and Rose Rain in the presidential suite."

tobuck_wallnut.8.t:0 "Stained Red"
tobuck_wallnut.8.d:0 ""I am curious about one thing, Niftyn. Why is it that you suggested hiding here in the wine cellar from the chaos above?"\n\nNiftyn coughed twice. "Dusk, this is a place where ponies go to celebrate, not fight. Wine is also very valuable when intact, and thus- Wait, do you hear that?"\n\nA long groan was heard from behind several large barrels towards the back of the cellar. The two comrades looked towards one another, then slowly peeked around the barrels. Therein laid an absolute mess of a pony, legs splayed out in all directions and several half-drunk wine bottles spilled both on the ground and on the uniform of the one and only Wallnut Drive. He opened his eyes, hiccuped, then half-grinned at the older ponies. "Hey guys... how are -hic- you?"\n\nDusk let out a long sigh. Was this truly what Tobuck had come to? A place where the 'important' ponies partied all day while riots broke out all around them? His bones ached just thinking about it. He offered a hoof to the drunken warlord, "Wallnut, are you all right?"\n\nWallnut flung his hoof in the general direction of Dusk's, but only connected on the third try. "Y-yeah, never -hic- better... whasabout yous?"\n\n"Wallnut, we're..." Niftyn couldn't help but picture where Tobuck might end up if Wallnut continued down this path, or even if a united Tobuck could survive in this state. Regardless, he also helped the young warlord up, "...We're just tired. That's all."\n\n"Huh?" Wallnut rubbed his eyes, suddenly processing that his friends seemed to be more than just tired. "No, no... yer not. Please -hic- tell me whats I can do to help you feels -hic- better..."\n\nDusk and Niftyn looked at one another again. They could see in each other's eyes that both of them had the same idea. One of them reached out to place a hoof on the Generalissimo, "Wallnut...""

tobuck_wallnut.10.d:0 "“This was a terrible idea.”\n\nGiven the precious little that they had found so far, Carrot Stick was probably correct in that assessment. As it turned out, the only documents that the warlord seemed to be keeping in his room at the hotel were ledgers from the various companies that had been contracted to provide for this party. Sneaking in, drunk as the entire hotel may have been, clearly hadn't been worth the risk.\n\nRose Rain hoofed over the bits of paper with a frown, “Not entirely fruitless though, now we know for sure that we should get out before-”\n\nJust as the thestral went to replace the 'documents' in a convincingly messy fashion, the bathroom door creaked loudly open. The uninvited guests could only stop and stare as they watched a barely-clothed and terribly hungover Wallnut step out, toothbrush firmly locked between his teeth. Clad in only a towel to cover his hindquarters, the stallion simply glanced at both of them and shrugged before going back into the bathroom to spit out the toothpaste.\n\nA moment later he returned, cleared his throat and held out a hoof. “Ugh... Look, I'm gonna be honest; I need your help. I'm... I'm gonna put on some clothes, try and figure out what in Tartarus is going on and do my best to get things sorted. Once things look a little less chaotic... Mmm... You can try your hooves at governing; that sound good?” he asked, managing a smile that convincingly hid his assumedly brutal headache.\n\nThe pair looked at one another, an idea already fully formed in their heads. Rose grinned and took his hoof with Carrot not far behind."

### Wallnut Harmony events

tobuck_wallnut.11.t:0 "One Shared Vision"
tobuck_wallnut.11.d:0 "The family of five was huddled around the radio they’d managed to get for the kitchen, more morbidly curious than hopeful. The last time somepony had taken over Tobuck they’d turned it into a smuggler’s heaven, which didn’t exactly bode well for this new ‘Wallnut Drive’ fellow. The foals liked him at least, though grandmare was far from convinced.\n\nSoft Brie carefully tuned the radio to the address that had been slated for the evening before sauntering over to sit next to her husband. “What do you think he’ll do with this place?”\n\nThe stallion simply looked at her, then at his mother and grimaced as the frequency came to life.\n\n“...Now I know what’s on all your minds, what with the war and Pea’s fun little deal with the Zarantians. I know a lotta you would probably wanna go through with it too, returnin’ to the peaceful life under the tribes an’ all. But, I ask of all of you, would anythin’ change? Would you ‘ave any more freedom? Would you ‘ave any more of that representation?”\n\nDim Bulb glanced at his wife who looked back with confusion in her eyes, over to the old mare in the corner who scoffed and picked up the paper as Wallnut Drive’s speech continued. He had a point, this city really had never been truly free to do as its people desired.\n\n“My friends and I, though I should really call ‘em my advisors, ‘ave put together a few ideas. Carrot Stick, Rose Rain and myself are gonna be turnin’ this place into a real democracy; harmony an’ all. Oh an’ of course we want your help to make it the best...”\n\nThe couple tuned out most of the rest, though their foals were still enthralled by the charisma of the thestral on the air. Unsurprisingly their grandmare had already sauntered into the kitchen with a disapproving look on her face, assuming it was another scam; but Dim and Soft were quietly hopeful."
tobuck_wallnut.11.a:0 "Maybe he’ll actually do it."

tobuck_wallnut.12.t:0 "Foundations of the Federation"
tobuck_wallnut.12.d:0 "“Rose, I understand where you’re coming from but you’re ignoring the practical limitations of our predicament. Neither Tobuck nor Chiropterra have any prior history of democracy or harmony; we need the president to remain powerful so that things remain stable whilst we set everything up, otherwise it will just fall apart by the time our work is done.” The thestral insisted, gesturing vaguely at Wallnut Drive every so often.\n\nThe mare sighed and shook her head before responding, “And I see what you’re getting at, but if we empower the president whilst reforming the country then what reason would the people have to engage in democracy? Why would they willingly vote for change in a regime that works and is already making the changes they want to see?”\n\nAs the two continued to bicker about what the right course of action was, Wallnut set down his newspaper with the half-finished crossword that had been provided by his secretary. He might not understand much about politics, but he knew how to resolve a hot debate between friends; even though his methods for such were typically rather primitive.\n\n“Both of you, shut it for just a mo.” He demanded in an unfamiliar bark, presumably the tone he took when commanding.\n\nThe pair nodded as he pulled up a chair and sat beside them.\n\n“Thank you. Now, I figure this might be a little hard to comprehend; but I’ll break it down for ya. What if you just do both? Give the president their powers and make ‘em accountable to the representatives or whatever. Power with scrutiny, right?” He offered, resting his chin on his hooves.\n\nFor a moment they sat in shock, glancing at one another both for the fact that Wallnut had actually involved himself in a political discussion and because his idea wasn’t that bad. In fact, they were both a little miffed that they hadn’t thought of it themselves."

There are some cultural ties, and some Zumidian leaders have expressed interest in joining with the up and coming Hazrumenian Union, although the Zumidians themselves seem quite divided on the matter.\n\nSome within our government have suggested we accept this deal, as Wallnut's interests align with ours in many ways, while others urge us to reject the deal and prepare to fight this Wallnut Drive, who they consider a petty warlord no matter how Harmonist his rhetoric. Still others suggest a compromise, whereby we end the Zumidian mandate on the condition that Zumidia be an independent member-state of the Hazrumenian Union rather than as part of ULNZ, which would ease some Zumidian worries while probably not angering the rising power."

The war with Chiropterra had brought with it great pains and widespread devastation; yet, piece by piece, things were going back to the way they had once been.\n\nLittle did they know that change was coming in perhaps the most radical way that the region had yet experienced. Even the once-legionary land would never have seen a policy like those that were about to be laid out in the name of socialism and equality. There was a dream at stake here, one that two ponies were willing to do many things to achieve.\n\nPublicly Wallnut too is celebrated as a hero; a courageous young leader who, with his own genius and skill, has found victory for his people. There is a feeling of unity amongst the public, one that could be considered deeply ironic if only the wider populace knew of the slowly deepening divide between the two factions in the government. For now they cooperate, at least when in view of the citizens of the federation, but there is no guarantee that the status quo will continue.

tobuck_wallnut.36.d:0 "Though the sun had set hours ago and the meetings had long since ended, Dusk Wane still remained in the primary conference room with only his thoughts to keep him company. It had been an exhausting day negotiating between the various groups representing the workers of Chiropterra, but he had managed to secure cooperation between them under his leadership. Even some moonspeakers had joined his cause, though not so much for their love of Dusk as opposed to their fear of what Wallnut would do to them.\n\nWallnut Drive... Dusk leaned back in his chair. He often wondered how the Generalissimo had gotten to this point. To rise above all the other warlords in Tobuck and unite the small country under his banner. Against all odds, he had defeated the mighty legions of Chiropterra as well. To an outside observer, one might think that Wallnut was a strategic genius and destined for greatness, perhaps he was, but Dusk knew what he was really like.\n\nWallnut was a buffoon. A charismatic buffoon for sure, but not a threat. No, the real threat was Niftyn who had already managed to gather several hardline communists under his leadership in Tobuck. Even though they had shared some drinks at the hotel, Dusk knew that their visions for the future were too incompatible with one another for them to truly cooperate. Already lines were being drawn and factions were gaining ground. A civil war was out of the question, but the future of the U.L.N.Z. would be decided not by any public grandstanding from Wallnut. It would instead be decided by the remaining rank and file of what used to be Chiropterra.\n\nDusk intended to make sure that Niftyn's cronies didn't take away that future from those who deserved it, even if it meant making tough choices to protect what was left of his homeland."

tobuck_wallnut.37.d:0 "It had felt like eons since they'd seen their old workplace. In truth, the workers of Nightmare Steelworks had found it difficult to believe that the factory was actually reopening. When the time came to return to work, many of them were afraid of changes that could be imposed by the new government. Many more were shocked to see that the giant mural of Nightmare Moon above the front entrance had been stripped away, replaced with a much more sombre art piece depicting a full moon in a starlit night sky. Even the name on the building had been changed; now it read 'Steel Moonworks.'\n\nTheir old boss had assured them that all the changes were made purely to comply with the new laws, but the workers still had their doubts. How could a new government that has torn down everything they believed in possibly have their best interests in mind?\n\nAs the workers approached the front entrance, a few well-dressed ponies exited the building. The well-dressed ponies introduced themselves to the workers, saying that they were with the United Labour Front. Many of the workers were confused and had inquired as to what that was.\n\n"A union meant to ensure the well-being of every labourer in Chiropterra! One of Dusk Wane's recently implemented programs!" they had explained. The workers seemed hesitant to believe them, but nicer and safer working conditions did sound appealing. Many of the workers stopped briefly to inquire further, figuring that the promises they were making seemed too good to be true.\n\nBut as they began their workday, it soon became clear that the new working conditions were much, much better than they used to be. Fear and worry dissipated almost instantly amongst them. One worker gave a last look to a wall where some graffiti of Nightmare Moon used to be. It was almost completely wiped away; only a faint remnant of the old faith remained."

tobuck_wallnut.38.d:0 "Though it had been some time since Wallnut's forces had devastated her hometown on the outskirts of New Ayacachtli, Pond Watch still found it difficult to accept the new reality of her situation as a Moonspeaker. Her local temple had been almost completely demolished, and when the time came to rebuild it, she was shocked when the new government had declared that Nightmare Moon had twisted their faith over the ages into a monstrosity. They said that all temples needed to be reshaped or reformed to depict the "old faith" of the rising Moon holding dominion over the night sky.\n\nPond had felt conflicted about this then, but when she had stepped back to think about all of the horrible things that her faith had done to those who rejected Nightmare Moon she realized that she too had become prejudiced towards the nonbelievers.\n\nWhen she joined the volunteer efforts to rebuild the temple, both Pond and several of her old friends were surprised to see each other there. Pond had exclaimed that she had resolved to save the faith from its wrongdoings and to help bring the light of the Moon back to all who needed it.\n\nShe was brought out of her thoughts when a bell rang, signifying that the reconstruction workers, many of whom didn't even share her religion, were about to arrive for lunch. She hoped that at least this gesture of kindness could help atone for her own sins. Pond smiled at the hungry ponies as they entered the room."

tobuck_wallnut.39.d:0 "The legionnaires were no easy threat to tackle either during or after the war. Federal Police detachments have been stretched thin thanks in part to the very recent creation of the force but primarily as a result of the widespread legionary resistance following the conflict.\n\nIn spite of the great danger posed to the police and the public, they have done a remarkable job in containing the Chiropterran fanatics. Several informant arrests have been made and a number of raids have been entirely prevented thanks to the work of our brave constables on night patrol. Unfortunately, resistance remains a serious problem.\n\nFor now the army has taken on some of the more dangerous roles that would be typically left to the jurisdiction of the police, an unsurprising level of cooperation given the circumstances. Whilst Dusk Wane has voiced his intentions to fully hoof over civil duties to the police once the Legionnaires run out of steam for good, the destruction that these devoted elites cause begets a continued vigilance."

Their numbers, supplies and morale are at an all time low. They haven't much fight left in them.” The pegasus shakily replied, either intimidated or simply still surprised.\n\nWalnut laughed and sat back in his chair, “You ain't on duty Brass, you can sound less 'official' than that!”\n\nActually, he was on duty; or at least he was supposed to be. Unfortunately one cannot simply say no to the Generalissimo, especially if he wants to take you somewhere to celebrate.\n\nHe would have found the irony irritating, if it weren't for how well-spirited the comment was. “As you say, Wallnut. And sure, I think we've got them.”\n\n“Much better. Hey!” He waved a hoof to get the attention of a waitress with his typically endearing smile before turning back to their guest. “What do you fancy?

He mulled over all that had transpired since he first became a Moonspeaker. The fall of his homeland and his newfound status in the country that had conquered it.\n\nDusk briefly closed his eyes. The time to put Chiropterra to rest had come.\n\nHe turned his attention to the crowd in front of him. "Brothers and sisters of New Ayacachtli, I have come to you this evening to tell you of the sins of the Legionary Council. They who practiced blind obedience to the Nightmare are the reason why Chiropterra lost so many lives in a pointless war. They who were so prideful that they failed to see how corrupted their faith had become over generations. They who thought of themselves as invincible to the end, and it was you all who paid the price for it.\n\n"The Legionary Council is no more. Scattered to the wind, much like the national pride many of you once felt. Some of you may still feel this way. Pride in Chiropterra, pride in the Nightmare; but that is not the way forward! Our Tobuckian brothers and sisters are offering us help in reforging this land into one our children can be proud of! We will not earn our salvation by merely praying for it, we must work for it! Join in labour with those around you and help bring this land out of the darkness of the Nightmare and into the light of the Old Moon!\n\n"That very light shines upon us now! The Old Moon has always watched over us. It has done so long before the Nightmare existed and it will do so after the last memory of the Nightmare fades away. It is eternal, much like its capacity for forgiveness. We must restore the old faith, the true faith. And if all of this is too much, then I only ask one thing of you...""

tobuck_wallnut.42.d:0 "A hoofball union, public facilities union, handypony union... He had been reading the most recently compiled list for some time already, but that was the point at which Dusk Wane decided that he had seen enough. The thestral's push for unions as a broader part of society and politics had worked, it seemed. New unions cropped up every day and very few of them seemed to be unsuccessful; in fact it seemed as though the boundaries between classes were slowly breaking down as more and more unique organisations developed around particular subjects that interested every strata of citizen.\n\nJust today he had been inspecting a proposal from the FAU - the Fine Art Union - which had petitioned to collect and present historical pieces from all across the federation in a new museum. The old pony smiled and sighed, deciding then that he would accept it when he was next in his office. After all, even socialist progress was always built upon a foundation of history; no matter what that history might be. If a union wished to preserve the artefacts of old, he could oblige such a request.\n\nNiftyn would probably have had the FAU shut down if he'd had the chance, much like many of the other unions that he considered 'pointless'; perhaps all of them would go eventually. It was truly a shame that they disagreed on so many of the finer details of socialism. Maybe once things were said and done they could sit and chat about why he was so enamoured with Steel Stallion, a question to which he would likely respond by asking why Dusk was so enamoured with religion."

"I'll let you know when it's time to see the surprise."\n\n---\n\nThe next day, after he was all done with his farmwork, Zagrum brought his son over to the town. They spent the rest of the afternoon watching the construction workers set up more of those wooden poles, along with some metal ones scattered around the town square. As the sun began to set, Zagrum's son asked if they could go home, as he was scared of the dark. Shaking his head, Zagrum watched one of the construction workers close a maintenance panel. He bore a huge smile and patted his son on the head.\n\n"Don't worry, soon you'll never have to be scared of the dark ever again."\n\nWith a flick of a switch, electrical lights blinked on all around them, piercing the approaching darkness and casting it out forevermore."

Wallnut just wished that he would explain what he actually wanted, it felt like Niftyn wasn't quite as friendly as he used to be.\n\nWallnut grinned, looking up in imagination. Nothing a pint of wine couldn't fix. He'd need to schedule some time with Niftyn to help him remember why Wallnut chose him to help run things! They'd be friends again in no time!\n\nAnd speaking of friends... Wallnut wasn't quite sure how to feel about Dusk Wane. Sure, he'd done a lot of great things around the Chiropterran region, but those blasted temples still stood. At least they weren't devoted to Nightmare Moon anymore. And he hadn't been called an apostate in almost a week!\n\nWallnut mulled over these thoughts for a bit, then came to the conclusion that overall, he was happy with how things were going.

You want me to pick my poison?” Wallnut gave out, putting it into the simplest terms for himself.\n\nThe other thestral at the table nodded and went to explain further, “Exactly. They're an experiment of sorts; to see what works and what doesn't, what sort of infrastructure we need to have in place and whether the investments are worth the input cost.” Realising that giving more detail would probably send their host to sleep, Dusk then got straight to the point. “As this is new technology, it should be used for civilian purposes. It is only fair that such state investments benefit the citizenry first and foremost, factories operated by the workers and for the workers.”\n\nNiftyn went to scoff but instead coughed, taking a moment to clear his throat before speaking. “The workers will have nothing to call their own if we can't protect what we've already worked so hard to build! The new facilities should be dedicated to military production, unless you wish to see the federation fall behind its enemies and shatter in a time of true crisis!”\n\nHaving received such an energetic rebuttal, the red moonspeaker went to argue; but Wallnut raised a hoof to make a choice and quell them both before he had to listen to another shouting match over policy."

tobuck_wallnut.48.d:0 "Niftyn let himself sink into his office chair upon seeing that it was already long past the time at which he should have gone home. For now, the stallion set aside the documents he had been composing and took a moment to think.\n\nHe reached into one of many jacket pockets for a half-empty packet of cigarettes, but found his hoof grabbing at something else. The old marksist grinned, leaning forward and taking out his years-old pocket copy of the Communist Manifesto, tied tightly with string to an even smaller volume of Steel Stallion's memoirs. Both little books had been damaged and lovingly repaired over the years, just so he could keep them close should they ever be needed.\n\nAs the revolutionary flipped aimlessly through the pages, he couldn't help but think of Wallnut; or, more specifically, of what Wallnut was and wasn't. He and that thestral were close friends with a relationship forged in the blood and fire of battle, but they did not see eye-to-eye when it came to politics. In all fairness, the Generalissimo was at least consistent. It wasn't that he disliked communism, far from it, more that he detested any and all forms of state management. He liked making friends first and foremost, which was sadly not part of the plan that two great authors of his most prized possessions had laid out. A socialist utopia must be led, guided by a visionary under the founding principles of the revolution as they had laid out. Though Dusk Wane and his puppets might disagree, anything less was abject failure.\n\nThat was how he saw the future of the federation and of Zebrica. He would bring forth a red dawn just as they had intended it, creating a perfect world where decadence and rot currently festered.\n\nHe sighed and reached into his jacket once again."

Sure, he could get behind that; middle class ponies in Tobuck were relatively few and far between, but he wasn't the sort to keep his privilege all to himself. That didn't stop this Niftyn fellow from annoying him by making a fuss about class, of course.\n\nWhen his daughter had asked to go to one of their rallies, that was when the alarm bells started ringing in his head. Not just about her - there were a lot of unsavoury individuals at these events after all - but also about how effective the propaganda had clearly been in getting ponies to at least attend even if they didn't listen.\n\nEventually he agreed to take her, realising that explaining politics and the concept of an ideology was far too complex for a ten-year-old and that talking about the funny shouty stallion after the fact would be far easier.\n\nThe red flags, the pamphlets and the officials bustled amongst the crowd as some jumped up demagogue stood at the front. They were rambling on about tearing down 'the decadent rule of monarchy, despots and kleptocrats' and how the federation must become a 'bastion of communism'. It was difficult to hear, here at the back of the worryingly large crowd, but at least his little filly seemed to be having a good time.

tobuck_wallnut.50.d:0 "A police force simply wouldn't do. The chaos caused and the danger posed by the remaining legionnaires necessitated a thorough and brutal response, not a prison sentence. Legionnaires did not deserve any mercy, nor the respect or dignity of a cell.\n\nHowever, it would also be inefficient to divert the military away from more formal operations in such a time as this. In a similar vein, a police force was needed to deal with less pressing concerns than domestic terrorism. To this, Niftyn proposed a very simple solution.\n\nAt the behest of the Generalissimo, the Internal Security Service has been formalised with the express intent to be used primarily as an anti-terrorist security force with the jurisdiction above that of the police and the firepower of the military. They are sworn to serve Wallnut first and foremost, but typically act on the orders of Niftyn simply so that the thestral can remain distant from bureaucracy.\n\nThough some within the government question the morality and rationality of such an extrajudicial force, none can deny the immediate effect that the ISS has had on Chiropterran resistance. There is much work left to do, but the decline in frequency and effectiveness of legionnaire attacks is proof enough that their efforts are not going to waste."

In fact, that's exactly what she tried to do; but the thestral had insisted, so she obliged.\n\nAt a little rest between the starter and main courses, the thestral finally broached the subject. “So, you reckon that you've got 'em all?” He asked with a slight smirk, hooves clasped together as he leaned over the table.\n\nAt that she raised an eyebrow, having stayed completely silent for the duration of their meeting thus far. “Some still fight, they soon wont.”\n\n“Ain't that scary soundin' huh? Lighten up a little lass, you ain't on the clock!” He offered with a friendly laugh, trying to make headway with his guest.\n\nUnfortunately, she picked up the menu instead. Looking at the items on it was far apparently more pleasurable for her than trying to make conversation.\n\n“C'mon Tarn, work with me at least a little; I'm tryin' to be personable here.” He gave out, a little exasperated by how anti-social his new friend was.\n\nShe looked up, grunted and placed the menu firmly down on the table. “Sir, me spending time here is actively putting citizens at risk. If I cannot return to my post, I would at least appreciate some peace and quiet.”\n\nWallnut was entirely taken aback, having seldom been so bluntly told to sod off."

Workers off of their work wasn't ideal for work inspection, but it was useful reporting back on the progression of socialist society in the working classes. After assuring his host that the inopportune timing wouldn't affect the inspection process, the pair headed off to get some food themselves.\n\nUnsurprisingly, their presence in the mess hall got them a lot of looks; but they weren't furtive glances or disgusted stares. In fact when they sat down with their food, a couple of workers came to sit with them.\n\n“Afternoon comrade. Lovely day to be out on the job isn't it?” A young adult stallion offered with a grin, catching the inspector almost entirely off guard.\n\nSwallowing a mouthful of sandwich, he then managed to actually respond. “A good afternoon to you too, comrade. It's certainly been a pleasure to take a tour around your place of work, a fine example of socialist progress.

Faces he'd never seen before, ponies he'd never spoken to; how was he supposed to make a verdict on whatever it was they were discussing? Actually, that might be a good place to start.\n\nThe thestral waited for a particularly loud moment before making a move, “Hey, hey! Shut your faces for sec' alright? Lemme get this straight, this is all about some stupid minin' contract, yeah? Tell me what ya want me to hear in one sentence and I'll pick.”\n\nBoth factions looked up at the Generalissimo with immense frustration, but did as requested. As he gestured to the right - they were privately certain that he didn't know which side followed which of his friends - Dusk Wane's political allies took the stand.\n\n“Tungsten is becoming a more and more important resource in the creation of modern technology both military and civilian, expanding our rare resource pool is the next logical step for our industrial sector.”\n\nAs their speaker took their seat, one of Niftyn's took the stand. “Steel is the backbone of our military industrial complex, if we neglect to maintain our stable foundation then the whole economic system might come crashing down!”\n\nBoth sides anxiously waited for him to raise his voice and choose,"

That was supposedly how all apartments like this were, so his friends had said; he personally hadn't much experience to call upon, being an ex-Labourer. All the new technology was here too, toasters and a small but presumably functional radio being the main attractions among other bits and pieces. Living in the city would be a massive departure from what his family were used to in the plantations, but it suited them.\n\nIt was affordable because of the fixed prices and rent - courtesy of Niftyn - with hundreds moving in every day to new homes just like this one, into the pristine admittedly bleak but cheap and functional housing. It was really something, and it was far less expensive than a new place in the country where all they would do was more farm work.\n\nScarlet Penny, his wife, piped up from across the room; buried in school pamphlets. “I've been looking at schools for the kids here and... Well, I... There's not an enormous number of choices, but it's better than whatever we could get elsewhere. Oh and look at this... 'Free inoculations for your foals' as well!” She read aloud from the paper in her hooves.\n\nLeather Duster turned and trotted towards her gleefully, still amazed at the fact that they were going to have more disposable income here than they would have had staying in the middle of nowhere. It was great. More money, about the same space but more things in it, better standards of living... There was nothing to lose, and the state was paying for a portion of the overhead; even the mortgage would be better.\n\nThe mare turned to her husband and looked at him with suddenly sultry eyes.\n\n“We can have more foals too, with all this room and capital.”"

We learned how to do some survival stuff like knots and making rope out of brambles! Oh and one of miss Yeva's friends from the army came in to show off his uniform and teach us about the military and to show us how to march while carrying a rifle! What else... Uhm... Oh we did some reading as well, lots of different books and even some really old stuff like Steel Stallion's memoirs!” He quickly explained, glad to change the subject as much as he was to talk about the experience.\n\n“Awh, that's wonderful dearie!” Cotton Ball exclaimed, glad for something to finally get Woollen out of the house and meeting new friends. “Thanks ever so much for looking after him today, I haven't had a more relaxing evening in the last ten years! How often do you run these little sessions?” She enquired after gesturing to her son to wait outside with an elated grin.\n\n“Three times a week, every week; with some extra special trips or fun things sprinkled here and there of course.

The Generalissimo was enjoying himself close by, signing autographs and generally bringing life to the already busy seating of the hall in which they were all sat. Important members of the Hazuremian Communist Party were sat up on the stage alongside him, perhaps the most recognisable being the now renowned Tarnished Silver who expectedly looked rather irritated at being dragged away from her work.\n\nMuch as he wanted to spend all afternoon observing his comrades, it was time for the earth pony to speak. “Comrades, workers of the federation! It seems as though so little time has passed since the foundation of our great socialist organisation. Already so many changes have been made, so many reforms enacted with the help and guidance of the HCP, and yet there are still so many more to come!”\n\nHe waited a moment as rapturous applause sounded throughout the audience and the attending officials alike before continuing on.\n\n“Yet for all our strength, all our effort and for the emerging communist utopia which we all dream to see; there is one glaring question that remains unanswered. What is the end goal of the federation? Where is our great state leading us, more specifically than victory and progress? Where shall the borders be drawn?” Niftyn poised, rhetorically of course. “We shall conquer Hazrumenia and beyond! We shall bring the revolution to all those who seek to crush it and liberate the workers of any who make the mistake of threatening our own! Communism shall not splutter and falter as it did under those who marred the vision of its founders!"

It was to be an announcement, and a very good one at that. Though he clearly didn't know it - or at least liked not to talk about it - the Generalissimo was little more than a military commander, in spite of his popularity.\n\nToday he would be declared 'Steel Generalissimo' by him and the Hazrumenian Communist Party as a whole, a title which he would obviously accept. Whilst he revelled in the immediate adoration from the public, his compliance in the bestowing of such a title would make him essentially a puppet of the party and of Niftyn. Wallnut would notice little difference of course, all politics was the same to him so long as he could make friends and have a good time; that was something that nopony planned to change.\n\nWhat was soon to disappear was Dusk Wane's political influence.

An unwise onlooker might have called it 'nationalistic' fervour, but it was no such thing. The federation was swept up by ideological revanchism, a kind of commitment to principles and an ideal that could seldom be found in other decadent nation states.\n\nMonarchies, frail republics and all countries that harboured capitalism knew that their time would soon come; that their own workers and socialists abroad would soon tear down the institutions they held dear. No more would the proletariat slave away beneath the boot of their oppressors, no more would they fear for their lives and their homes; all would stand and fight.\n\nWallnut's speeches, the rallies and the marches all passed on the same message.

The methods were a little harsh perhaps, but the effect of their implementation was staggering. After several inspections, it seemed to him that discipline and in particular the dedication of the soldiers had never been better; easily justifying the comparatively small cost in lives.\n\nThe paperwork seemed likewise daunting at times for the commissar-colonel, but it was simply part of the job now. If enforcing state complete state control over the militias was a job that he had been unprepared for then he would never have taken it in the first place. Organising it was tough certainly, especially given that some units had even held inter-militia elections, but he was up to the task. It seemed his subordinates - not least whoever it was that had sent the death warrant - were similarly dedicated.\n\nAfter a few more bits and pieces, he kicked up his hooves for a short break.

The last time the old stallion had tried to explain it to him the whole conversation had admittedly gone somewhat over his head, partially because of all the terminology he didn't understand but mostly for his lack of interest.

For the first time in a long time, they both remembered why it was that they served him instead of simply taking power for themselves.\n\nHe slammed down the phone on the ornamental receiver, sat on the edge of his desk and stared at his two old companions with a scowl that only an angry mother could match. “See what you morons have done 'ere? D'you realise just how much chaos you fancy-dress freebooters have caused?! Tartarus, If I cared any less about the both of ya I'd have you court-martialed and shot for this.

What a tartarusish few months it had been, trying to organise whatever was left of the local and central governing bodies and getting these imbeciles to work together again.\n\nIn the end the mess had been fairly neutral for his image at least; the opening days of the Scarlet War had called his leadership into question, but as time went on and the workers saw him out and about helping the damage was mostly reversed. Trust in the government itself was essentially nonexistent, but at least he didn't have to worry about his own position. The less said about Dusk Wane and Niftyn, the better.\n\nHis assistant, one of the few working with the government who seemed to be loyal to him first and the bickering factions second, poked her head through the door.\n\n“Sir, do you have a moment?” The mare asked, voice aquifer.\n\nHe stared at her, having poured a glass of whiskey. “Sure, so long as it ain't spent on work stuff; I'm off that for the day.”\n\nShe smiled and sauntered in, “No, for once. I... I need a break as well. You know, all this is... It's a lot, for me. I can't imagine what it's like for you.”\n\nHe poured a second glass and, in spite of his temperament, managed a smile.

What with your religion and our disagreements on seemingly all things from the economy to social policy; I just thought that everything would have fallen apart by now. Somehow... it hasn't. Doesn't that surprise you?” He asked, leaning over and putting out his cigarette in the glass ashtray on the table.\n\nThe thestral set down his paper and thought for a moment. It was impressive in some respects that their factions within the government seemingly retained complete parity; in fact, it was very much like a two-party democracy in that respect. The federation was still socialist and far more progressive than that of course, but the comparison could certainly be made.\n\nHe smiled and nodded slowly, “I suppose it is a little. But we've done some great things, haven't we?

Everything was done through commissariats and the central government now, it just made things so much easier.\n\n“Come on. Out. All of you.” The familiar voice of Tarnished Silver bluntly ordered.\n\nHe could just about see and hear what was going on through the pane.

Most importantly, one of her closest friends had been whisked away to Tobuck on an exchange and in his place sat an earth pony. He was quiet for the most part, save for when he tried and failed to answer pointed questions about his family and whether he worshipped the Nightmare or not. Oddly enough, when their new teacher overheard the latter question on one occasion she broke things up entirely which she found very suspicious. Was he a spy? Was the teacher a spy too?\n\nNeedless to say the colt - Saleet was apparently his name - wasn't having a good time. Even Honey occasionally dropped comments behind his back despite her typically kind-hearted nature. He was an easy target, especially with how different their lessons had suddenly become. Before they'd hardly even heard of socialism and now it was in everything from maths to literature, it was the simplest thing to pin all their concerns on somepony that was different.\n\nAt the very least their collective fear of the outsider made study relatively easy and kept them engaged with the lessons. The earth pony struggled a lot in class and had seemingly only just learnt to read, but he always came back for more.

You seem nice and I wanted to talk to you, ask you how you're doing.”\n\n“Oh, that's... That's new. Well I could be better, I-I think. Reading is hard with the wind.” He returned, making a little nervous laugh.\n\n“I get it.

tobuck_baragzen.2.d:0 "Of all things that he might have anticipated interrupting his morning routine, Baragzen had not expected a small all-pony group of enlisted stallions trying to seek an audience with him in his own home. They sauntered down the country lane as the zebra nibbled on a particularly expensive flower with a scowl, desiring nothing more than to turn them away.\n\nYet, for fear of his reputation and the sanctity of his manor, the lord came to his door as they approached it. Needless to say, his uninvited guests were quite surprised to see him open up just as they went to knock.\n\nHalf of them bowed and the other half saluted on instinct whilst one amongst them went to speak “Apologies for the early interruption sir - Spring Breeze at your service. Do you have a minute?”\n\n“I'm listening.” He grunted simply, taking a sip from some brew that they couldn't identify.\n\nThe only unicorn amongst the group stepped forward and unloaded his saddlebag, revealing a small heap of documents. Baragzen raised an eyebrow at this, but understood quickly once he saw the familiar stamp of the royal guard recruitment office. They had all had their applications for the Oath Wardens rejected, for the simple fact that they were ponies and not zebras which were the only race that was currently allowed to earn such a position of prestige. After all, the legends never mentioned anything about ponies.\n\nSpring went to actually explain their issue, but the zebra raised a hoof to indicate that it wasn't necessary. He understood perfectly.\n\nIt would be an affront to the very myths that birthed the royal guard to allow ponies into their ranks, but then the limitations certainly weren't practical given the majority pony population of Tobuck. After he made a very vague but convincing promise to the group and returned inside, Baragzen spent much of the day considering the future of his most prized soldiery."
tobuck_baragzen.2.a:0 "We need more hooves, it makes sense to welcome the ponies."
tobuck_baragzen.2.b:0 "Traditions are sacred, we must continue the zebra preference."

tobuck_baragzen.3.t:0 "The Last Gunrunner"
tobuck_baragzen.3.d:0 "Vasile sat on the open patio carefully hidden within a little square created by the walls of his home, himself nestled comfortably in a deck chair under the sun. This wasn't his typical way to spend the latter part of a work day, but circumstances had compelled him to cancel some items on his afternoon schedule. A short break was absolutely in order. Just two hours ago he had been informed of an offer from Baragzen by his secretary, one that was not made with the underlying threat of being arrested for business malpractice.\n\nThe result of that offer was that he was now Mayor of Tobuck. Well they hadn't called it that or even given the position a name as of yet, but 'Mayor' was a good way of summarising his new responsibilities and powers of economic management.\n\nWith all that was going on - the regional political troubles in particular were very concerning - Vasile was seriously considering leaving altogether, which was still very much on the table. Just because he had accepted premiership over a region with the intent to make as much money as physically possible alongside his associates didn't necessarily mean he had no other options. If Chiropterra or Zarantia came a-knocking he still had an exit strategy; but playing along would be prudent, at least for now.\n\nAll in all this Baragzen fellow was turning out to be quite the helpful zebra, not least because he seemed to be entirely unaware of Vasile's various economic misdemeanours. If anything this might eventually prove to be one of the most profitable endeavours of his career thus far, particularly if the exiled lord continued to claw over economic responsibilities to his subordinates with little to no imposed oversight.\n\nHe would have to arrange some sort of party for him and his new employer, one at which he could invite and introduce guests. After all, even the worst creatures in the world need to put on a pleasant face from time to time if they want to get anywhere."
tobuck_baragzen.3.a:0 "Quite the arrangement, if it sticks."

tobuck_baragzen.4.t:0 "His Ancient Legacy"
tobuck_baragzen.4.d:0 "It was, in essence, a little tea party of sorts; not all too dissimilar from the sort of thing that one might observe a little zebra arranging in a doll house were they rich enough to own one. In fact, a foal's imagination would probably be a more reasonable explanation for the domesticated leopard currently lounging at Baragzen's hooves.\n\nHis explanation was simple, though the decision as a whole was strange nonetheless. “...and of course, what better pet to cherish than one that shares the family name? Isn't she ever-so sweet...” He gave out, half in jest and half in earnest.\n\nThe lord took a piece of cured fish from the table and fed it to the surprisingly docile creature as his guests looked on with a combination of awe and confusion. So far he hadn't displayed much in the way of eccentricity or self-indulgence and this was a little of both.\n\nYarikh and several others took quite kindly to the beast all the same, occasionally forking over some morsels for her whenever they went to fill up their plates at the table of various dinner party treats. Baragzen also made sure to have plenty himself of course; he was quite content to sit, eat and talk with his rather large attending party.\n\nIndeed it was a wholly pleasant affair with the lord receiving plenty of praise for his exploits which he accepted graciously. Every attendee treated him with the utmost respect - almost as though he were already royalty - and he very much enjoyed the proceedings.\n\nAt a point of particular ease he even joked, “Too many of these parties and I might lose myself in them!”"

Just minutes ago he had been informed that the front page of their tabloid was going to be horribly incorrect; which had resulted in him getting out of bed and rushing down to their offices along with some of his night-owl employees who had been awake when he tried their doors. The pony he'd assigned to reporting on the conflict had been doing such a great job so far, but neither of them had anticipated that the soldiers would simply retreat and return home after such a hard-fought war.\n\nHe'd have to call the printer operators and have them stop immediately at least, but then what would he replace the pages with?\n\nAnother of his employees burst into the room, gripping a pencil with a near-mad look in her tired eyes. “I have it sir! We've got something to put on the cover!” She blurted, dashing over to his desk and laying out some scrawled plans.\n\n“Thank goodness,” He returned, sighing in relief and scouring the sheets he had been presented with. “What have you got for me?”\n\nBlunt Lead realised he probably couldn't read half of it and began to explain, “We tried to focus on how our troops are bringing vast amounts of wealth back to Tobuck rather than spend too much time on the treaty itself, you know what they'll do if we make it too negative.”\n\n“Good, good. That's good. I'll send it off to print.” The stallion gave out, stuffing the documents into a briefcase which he would soon run down to their warehouses.\n\n“Wait, wait! We didn't decide on a headline; here, choose between these on the way over!”\n\nShe frantically scribbled a note which he took between his teeth as he galloped out of his office, only getting a chance to look at the options once he was down three flights of stairs."

Not only has Tobuck, in spite of the state's lacking resources and stability, successfully annihilated the comparatively existential threat that is Chiropterra; but they have done it under the leadership of an old enemy.\n\nEven during his stint in the court he was considered a reactionary and spiteful noble, one that was expelled from Warzena years ago for a very good reason. Now he wields the might of a mercenary army turned professional force and slowly centralises power with the support of other prominent exiles in Tobuck. Rumour has it that he has already made contact with conservative elements within the government whilst public perception has gradually shifted away from passive mirth at a madmare in the papers to considering his return a real possibility.\n\nMore worrying still is that he has a claim to the throne of Warzena as head of the ancient Leopard dynasty, making his inevitable future conquests and choices all too clear. Some amongst the administration have, with a little encouragement from his recent success, started quietly debating the validity of that very claim."

tobuck_baragzen.7.d:0 "Each of Baragzen's three guests eyed each other at regular intervals as they took a slow trot through a pleasantly secluded area of his mansion's extensive garden. Yarikh, Tanis and Jetzabel had no innate reason to distrust one another but, disparate as they were, they had little cause to welcome each other. That was his part of the proposed bargain, uniting whatever was left of the nobility that might stand to oppose the weakling king. So long as he remained calm and collected, they would no doubt cooperate; at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nThey emerged from the grounds and into a small seating area with a semi-circular bench, at which each zebra took seats for the host to speak. “Now, I need not repeat the terms of our arrangement; indeed your very presence here indicates that you have, however tentatively, already accepted my offer. Nevertheless, as I am currently a mere gentlecolt rather than a king, I saw fit to invite you to my home to discuss matters in a more intimate fashion."\n\nThis clearly eased the group somewhat who were pleased to hear that he was earnest and far from a fool despite his aloof demeanour.\n\nYarikh spoke first, the fellow exile was no doubt eager to reclaim what he had lost. "So long as my old holdings are returned and the security of my family and position can be ensured... Well, this bargain is more than agreeable."\n\n"In addition to maintaining our current claims to land and property of course," Jetzabel quickly added, keen to gain as much as was possible under the circumstances.\n\nBaragzen then turned to look then at Tanis, who seemed to be deep in thought. She was likely considering her potential role in the reinvigoration of their traditional faith, a project she had desired to embark on for many years.\n\n"I apologise for my slow contemplations, but this is a potentially very dangerous decision." She explained, receiving an understanding nod from Baragzen and causing the other two guests to glance at one another. "I am, however, very interested; perhaps I need not be so concerned."\n\nAt that their host smiled and clasped his hooves together in barely-hidden glee,"

tobuck_baragzen.8.d:0 "A griffon in Tobuck was typically an unusual sight, but there was one that everypony had begun to recognise in the bustling city. Vasile's charisma and commitments to various projects within the city had garnered him a lot of attention, which was precisely the reason Baragzen had decided this time to pay him a visit rather than send a communiqué.\n\nSitting calmly in the back of his personal limousine, the zebra turned to speak. “Well, I can only say that my choice of administrator could not have been better made. You have done an excellent job thus far my friend, in fact I have a mind to reward you for your excellent service.” He offered with an uncharacteristically genuine smile.\n\nAt this Vasile politely shook his head, “That's very kind of you my liege, but my service under the true king of Warzena is a gift in and of itself.”\n\nThat was perhaps one of the greatest lies he had ever told as he was already considering just how much he could earn in expanding his policy of profiteering. Tobuck was prospering more than it ever had before and he was making sure to gain alongside it; insider trading, careful arrangements of tax breaks in growing industries that he had controlling shares in and an additional myriad of policies that most would consider 'corrupt' implemented all across the nation... The possibilities were truly immense, but it would do no good to come off to Baragzen as ambitious.\n\nHis humbleness had the desired effect as the zebra laughed haughtily, entirely unaware of how much was slipping away into the talons of his own statesgriff. “Surely you jest! I could not think of one more deserving of a promotion than yourself!”\n\nThe griffon simply chuckled and raised his claws in a mockery of begrudging acceptance as the lord seemingly had the spark of an idea,"

tobuck_baragzen.9.d:0 "Frankly it was impossible to decipher exactly what was going on. So many things had happened in such a short space of time that the loyal elements of the administration struggled to even identify the disloyal ones. On top of that rebellion itself seemed to be in a state of chaos, thriving all the more with assistance of what the king had to assume was an invasion.\n\nIt seemed that Baragzen had been a very intelligent stallion, ensuring that any conflict that erupted between himself and Warzena would be seen as less of a war and more of a civil conflict that extended into the borders of Tobuck thanks to logistical, military and national confusion. Even the armed forces seemed almost unsure of who they were supposed to be fighting and which generals were aligned with the establishment was anyzebra's guess.\n\nNeedless to say this has created a state of utter disarray and our allies are seemingly unwilling to act for fear that they may intervene on the wrong side or that they may spark further conflict between the feuding nobility. Contacting our allies and establishing a stable chain of command will take a long time; all we can do is hope that enough loyalty amongst the remnants of the army remains and hold out until help arrives."

tobuck_baragzen.10.d:0 "The conflict didn't come as a complete surprise.

What had not been expected was the depth of instability that a potential invasion - if it could even be called that - would cause.\n\nWhilst the exile had indeed 'declared war' on Warzena by proclaiming himself as its rightful ruler, what has followed in recent days and through reports is more equivalent to an exceedingly messy civil conflict. At first intervention seemed the easiest and correct course of action, as it would be in assisting an ally in times of conflict, but the reality has developed entirely aside from our expectations.\n\nThanks in part to our lines of communication being cut and the general chaos that appears to be the norm for all facets of the Warzenan state, intervention has become a precarious proposition. We can only hope that the government survives long enough to reestablish contact."

tobuck_baragzen.12.d:0 "In spite of his commitments to tradition, there were some things that needed to be done differently now that the worst was over. In the past amnesty was occasionally and sparingly granted, typically in accordance with the personal biases of each reigning monarch. In that sense this decision would be no different, but in others it was certainly a departure from the norm.\n\nUnlike the weakling king who hadn't the heart to vanquish Baragzen and suffered the consequences, the true king would make no such mistakes. The entirety of the ruling opposition would be executed, effective immediately. Even his hoof shook a little as he signed their death warrants; it was never a simple thing to order the death of another when they were defenceless, but it was ultimately necessary.\n\nWhen it came to the soldiers and the generals who had played little part in the fighting as well as those that had defected, the lord was kind. Soldiers fight because it is their job and their loyalty was necessary in order to secure his power. In addition, civil servants and other common folk were spared the wrath of the vengeful exile; he needed their approval as much as the usurper needed their compliance, there was no need to punish them.\n\nIn the capital of Warzena zebras were slowly going back to their normal lives, anticipating Baragzen's arrival and his inevitable coronation. Already the nobles that had sided with him were making preparations and cleaning damage from the streets, making due arrangements for the long-denied dynasty's return. Even Vasile could occasionally be spotted on occasion whilst he toured around the streets and the palace to ensure that everything was in order."

Some elements of it were revived rites from ancient times whilst others were entirely new; indeed Baragzen had miraculously acquired an entirely new set of exuberant royal artefacts and luxurious clothes for use during the ceremony so that he need not touch the corrupted crown of the weakling king.\n\nNow was the part for which he had truly needed to prepare. The new king of Warzena carefully walked up the beautifully carved staircase to a balcony upon which he would speak to his innumerable followers. A number of microphones and speakers had been erected for the sake of the enormous crowd of commoners and soldiers alike that had gathered to receive him. Some were excited, others anxious and all were wondering just how this new king was going to rule. They were in for quite a surprise.\n\nAfter waiting for the applause to die down, even encouraging his hosts to stop with hoof gestures and a warm smile, Baragzen went to speak. “My loyal subjects, it is a great honour for me and the Leopard dynasty to finally return to this great state. For too long you have languished under a weak monarch, one that brought you and the rest of our once prosperous nation no less than utter stagnation and complete subservience to foreign powers. No more! I say no more! We have triumphed over the existential threat of Chiropterra! We have triumphed over weakness and decay and we triumph over all challenges that face us!” He declared, stopping only to catch his breath and observe the varied reactions of the crowd.\n\n“In an era of foreign imperialism and instability, we shall prosper; but it is not enough to only prosper in the face of greater foes. If we wish to survive and to revive our long lost legacies, we must compete with our enemies! We must fight and we must win!

Two warlords in Tobuck remained and she needed the support of one to guarantee a victory against the other. Baragzen, an exiled noble with a reputation for capriciousness, was one.

Alesia had just been granted an immense sum of money from a particularly wealthy exile who, in spite of her limited repute, was apparently enamoured by her successes thus far.\n\nHer aide, one Entin Miron, stood with her as they watched the ship of the kind donor unload in port. “Commander, I'm of the opinion that we should use this money to modernise our weapon stockpiles; it's high time that we retired our old materiel.”\n\n“Without the facilities required to produce them en masse, we may end up with too few weapons overall; though you are right to say that our current stockpile is worryingly outdated.” She retorted, though appreciative of his insight.\n\nQuantity or quality, industrial prowess or improved equipment.

Nevertheless, new claimants were found every now and then; though few held any interest in the position of Tsar.\n\nA profile of five new ponies had been compiled for her, but none of them were particularly impressive. A drunk, a lunatic, somepony that was old enough to die before she could possibly hope to reclaim the homeland and another two that were at least relatively promising. Even so, they were far from perfect; one was hardly active with the exiled community and another didn't even live in Equus anymore.\n\nAlesia sighed and rubbed her forehead with her right hoof, staring at the papers for a moment before standing up and trotting over to one of many filing cabinets in her office."

tobuck_alesia.4.t:0 "The Importance of Faith"
tobuck_alesia.4.d:0 "Strolling the gardens of the presidential palace at night, Alesia thought back to what she'd seen earlier that day. Ponies and zebras gathered together outside for a ceremony honouring one of their gods, singing hymns together under the scorching Zebrican sun. These creatures had nothing: although Alesia's governance had rooted out much of the corruption and decadence of the criminal-elite, she was under no illusions. These creatures, her creatures, had no security, they had no heritage, they were surrounded by enemies, and most of them owned little more than the clothes on their backs. And yet they had their faith.\n\nPerhaps that was why the red devils hated religion so, she thought, gazing up at the moon. They could take home, family, property and nation away from honest creatures, but in order to truly break them they had to also take their gods. Alesia had never been a particularly religious mare, but she swore then and there that she would not run a secular state. Tobuck would be united in faith, just as soon as she had consolidated her rule enough to make it so.\n"And what shall I swear this to?" she mused aloud, remembering the moonlit rituals her family used to perform, so long ago."
tobuck_alesia.4.a:0 ""I guess I'll swear this to you.""

tobuck_alesia.5.t:0 "Victory Over Chiropterra"
tobuck_alesia.5.d:0 "The reports were grim. The financial and materiel cost of the war against Chiropterra had been high, but the occupation was quickly becoming even more expensive. Raids, terror attacks and all manner of resistance activity were rampant; but if they retreated from the territory then their regime of zealots would simply return under new leadership, one that would also wish see Tobuck annihilated. What choice did they have but to stay?\n\n“Good evening ma'am,” An unfamiliar voice gave out from behind her.\n\nAlesia stopped and started. She knew all of her servants personally; whoever this was, they were an intruder that had slipped past her guards. Instinctively she drew her pistol and wheeled about, pointing the weapon squarely at the forehead of the interloper.\n\nWithout hesitation or stutter she demanded an explanation, “Who are you and why didn't you take the opportunity to kill me whilst my back was turned?”\n\n“Because I, a loyal servant of the Chiropterran Moonspeakers, was not ordered to take your life. I have been tasked with delivering this to you and nothing more.” The hooded zebra replied, hardly batting an eye.\n\nHe raised a hoof slowly into one of his robes' pockets and drew out a small scroll, which he then placed on a cabinet. Alesia marched forward and took it, keeping her gaze firmly planted on her uninvited guest all the while.\n\nShe turned to the still-open door and called out, “Guards! Take this stallion away!”\n\nThe zebra nodded slowly, before sitting on the floor and starting to pray in a language she didn't understand. Recognising that he wasn't a threat, Alesia holstered her weapon and read the note as a cacophony of friendly hooves thundered down the hallway to her quarters.\n\nIt was an invitation."
tobuck_alesia.5.a:0 "She was on the phone to Entin within minutes."

tobuck_alesia.6.t:0 "Blessed of the Moon"
tobuck_alesia.6.d:0 "Entin was pacing back and forth, his boots clacking against the stone of this abandoned house's courtyard. He was convinced that this was a trap, which was a reasonable assumption to make all things considered. His commanding officer on the other hoof thought this would be the precursor to some kind of ceasefire or conditional surrender. If the Chiropterran Moonspeakers wanted her dead, they would have killed her already by now.\n\nA collection of hooftsteps grabbed their attention. As promised, a group of moonspeakers headed by one just ahead of the rest approached them. Alesia waited for one in their number to speak.\n\n“Alesia Snezhnaya, I assume?”\n\nShe nodded, “And you are?”\n\nThe figure stepped into better view and smiled, “Lunar Hail; I am the representative for all Moonspeakers in Chiropterra.” She returned, stopping and bowing deeply before the warlord.\n\nThen the rest bowed too, following their leader's example. They both knew of her, one of the most zealous and renowned authorities of their faith. Why was she here and, more importantly, why were they bowing?\n\nAlesia smiled, mostly out of surprise. “I see. Am I not your enemy, thanks to recent events?”\n\n“On the contrary, you deserve the utmost respect for your achievements. Only a worthy individual, one with the blessing of the Nightmare could defeat Her Imperial Majesty's legions and-”\n\n“These kind words are appreciated, but the longer this takes the more of my soldiers die fighting yours. What is the point of all this?” The pony cordially demanded.\n\nFor a moment Lunar looked displeased, but remembered then that her legion too was suffering. “Of course. To be blunt, we wish for you to rule over Chiropterra; the Nightmare blessed you with gifts and us with you, we shall not waste that opportunity.”"

tobuck_alesia.7.d:0 "For a while there was silence. The terms for cooperation had been laid out, mostly by the Moonspeakers for fear that either party would displease the other. Alesia's eyes slowly scanned the faces of the legion commanders, but they were difficult to read. In that respect, they were much like her.\n\nEmerald Light was the first to speak, glancing at Lunar Hail before resting her attention on their new ruler. “It's the only reasonable solution. I do as the faith commands.”\n\nShe bowed and stepped back for the others to voice their minds.\n\n“So long as we maintain our status and keep our legions, I take no issue with this agreement. The Nightmare wills and I follow.” Autumn Breeze agreed, performing a similar act of respect.\n\nLightning Charm scowled, but nodded nonetheless. “I am displeased primarily with the performance of our military. I shall cooperate on the provision that I am permitted to reform the legions so that they never suffer such a loss again.”\n\nAlesia assented to that request, seeing as it would only benefit their combined armed forces. Then she looked to the two remaining figures, who looked somewhat ambivalent. Stone Palisade simply shrugged and bowed, knowing that this was the way forward and seeing their loss as demonstrative of the need for change. Eternal Eclipse was clearly disgruntled, but he made to speak.\n\n“I agree to the proposal, on the condition that I be permitted retire and that my position will be given to my grandson Lucent. I am too old now to reform Chiropterra on such a scale as this, but he shall be of much use to you.”\n\nThe warlord acceded, “That can be arranged.”"

This land belongs to me as your Tsaritsa and the Nightmare as your Goddess in equal measure.” Alesia gave out, finishing her speech and sighing with the knowledge that she would definitely still need the script during the address.\n\nThe familiar sound of Entin's quick trot alerted her to his presence at the door to her office. He was still in uniform even at this hour of the night, but then so was she. They had both had a very long day.\n\nHe made a half-hearted smile, “Not bad. You sure know what to say to these zealots.”\n\n“Can we not do this right now?” She snapped immediately.\n\n“No. We can not not do this right now, especially not after you shot me down the first time. What in Tartarus are you doing, cooperating with these maniacs? You told me that your parents never got through to you!” He pressed, furrowing his brow at the attempt to push the question further down the road.\n\nAlesia set down the paper she had been reading from and lowered her head onto a wooden trunk with a grimace, looking at her long-time friend out of the corner of her eye.\n\n“They didn't Ent, not like that anyway. I never accepted their faith for a number of reasons, but I never turned it away either. Right now I just want the violence to stop. We need it to stop.” She answered slowly, lifting her head and taking some long breaths.\n\nHe stood there silently, before nodding. “Promise me you'll be careful with all this Nightmare stuff.

Now here she was, with leadership thrust upon her in a fashion she could never have expected.\n\nThe medals she wore on her royal attire were numerous and heavy. Some were from her time in the Royal Guard, some were awarded during her time fighting for various factions in Zebrica and some had been bestowed by the Chiropeterrans. It was almost an alien feeling to be all dressed up like this now, so far away from home. But this was home now. Novaya Severyana would be her realm and her legacy, her nation and people to mould as she saw fit. Commanding an army was now commanding a state and a society, one that could be great but one that equally could never be quite what she had envisioned to settle down in.\n\nDespite it all, she felt an inkling of pride; in a roundabout sort of way she'd achieved what she had arrived in Zebrica to do. All that remained was to finish what she was now starting."

Luck most likely, or it was one of the few ships that had been out of port during the revolution.\n\nThat train of thought was cut short as she watched its occupants disembark. A line of lower nobles, a few generals, some soldiers and a few average citizens exited their floating scrapheap; followed by the crew shortly afterwards. Though their number was few, this was more than she had been expecting. Even its people were now largely apathetic to the dream of reclaiming Severyana, but some heeding her call was better than none at all.

Will you in all of your granted strengths maintain the oaths of your forefathers before you? Will you, with these gifts from our goddess that raises the moon, do all in your power to work in service of your people before all else?”\n\n“All this I promise to do. The things which I have before promised, I will perform and keep; so help me Nightmare.” She finished, wondering silently to herself whether their deity would be truly pleased with her ascension.\n\nSome more ceremony followed, the anointing and the providing; all without issue, as expected for an event so rehearsed as this. Alesia didn't need to think much for those, only sit in her royal seat stoically until it was time to receive the newly made crown jewels. As Lunar placed the crown on her head and the seated dignitaries stood up to sing the old Severyanian anthem, Tsaritsa Alesia stood herself with a hoof to her chest and one thought in her mind."

tobuck_alesia.12.d:0 "This would have been dull even if she wasn't Tsaritsa. This ceaseless debate about when Nightmare Night should be was farcical in the extreme, yet it was important enough to the faith that making the decision for them could be taken poorly. For whatever reason this argument seemed to transcend the usual waxist-revivalist divide on occasion and thus was seemingly impossible to resolve.\n\nOne half of the Moonspeakers wanted to keep the date as it was, seeing that there was really no reason to change it as it was already an anticipated national holiday. The others, taking the opportunity of new management to press their agenda, wished to rediscover the day of the year that it was originally supposed to be; as though it really mattered what time of the year that the Nightmare was celebrated. In Alesia's mind the obvious time to do such a thing, if it mattered at all, would be the winter solstice. But, with the aggressive tone that was resurfacing for the third time today, she decided that this wasn't her fight.\n\nThe monarch slumped in her seat and stifled a yawn as the shouting began again, tempted to pray for her slowly dwindling patience and sanity."

No matter what the zebra may or may not have done, his role as Moonspeaker was sacred; on the other hoof, he really didn't want to find out what methods they employed besides the threat of force.\n\nOne of the officers sighed and rummaged in her pockets, “Let me read one of the tips for you.” She pulled out a piece of paper and unfurled it, “Here we are: 'Moonspeaker Hard Term has been preaching about the importance of harmony in his sermons. I thought that was something that Celestia preached...' so on and so forth. We ignored the first note or two that we received on this matter as you are one of the Nightmare's chosen few, but we've had several more than that since.”\n\nThe zebra sighed and hung his head, having known that something like this would happen eventually.

None of them wanted to be here, but they wouldn't be allowed out unless they proved themselves faithful to the tenets of the Tsaritsa's preferred form of Nightmare worship.\n\nThe door to the large cell-turned-classroom opened and another Moonspeaker walked in, flanked by a few members of the Druzhina. “Right then. You all know why you're here and so do I, but I make no exceptions on the basis of mutual understanding. At this moment in time, every single one of you is a heretic; but Her Majesty, in her infinite wisdom, has granted you all a unique opportunity. Given that you're all here, you've also elected to take said opportunity over rotting in a cell.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of them responded.

Lunar Hail had experienced a mix of emotions following the failed invasion of Tobuck; quiet distress had rapidly turned into a renewed vigour once Alesia had accepted their proposal. Now she served the Nightmare and another of her ordained servants, the Tsaritsa of Novaya Severyana.\n\n“Oh most holy Nightmare above, make me a pony of prayer and use me to bless this congregation with my life. Pour out the essence of the night upon me and give me strength. Nightmare, please rebuke the sun and its false idol that wills to keep us in bondage. Give us victory over the unfaithful through the power of the eternal moon,”\n\nShe didn't bother looking up, knowing that the attendees both inside and outside of the cathedral would have their heads bowed as her voice boomed through loudspeakers.

May the united voice of your people rise up to the moon itself in a mighty chorus of praise!”\n\nThousands of voices chanted back, “Nightmare bless the faithful and her chosen.”\n\nThe Moonspeaker couldn't help but smile then as she went on, “We believe in one deity, the Nightmare almighty, maker of dreams who for us and for our salvation came down from the moon and shall again return. Almighty Nightmare, our refuge, fountain of wisdom and tower of strength who knows that we can do nothing without her guidance and help; assist us and direct us with divine wisdom and power, so that we may accomplish our ordained duty as your subjects.”"

There was a little tension in the air perhaps, a few things that Dull Blade still wasn't overly comfortable with like the portraits of the Tsaritsa beside those of the Nightmare.\n\nThe Chiropterran batpony stopped mid-walk and mid-thought to laugh quietly to herself then, realising that she had called Alesia the Tsaritsa without a second thought. Maybe she really was getting used to all that had happened after all. She quickly resumed her trot with a slight smile and found herself on the high street a few minutes later; it was the time of the week for Grocery shopping.\n\nFrankly Dull wasn't used to all this choice. Her Majesty, there it was again, had actually allowed the shops to fully restock for the first time in years. Constant military austerity was, as far as she could tell, a thing of the past. That wasn't to say that the military wasn't big or powerful of course, but something at the top had changed; something that made her life easier.\n\nShe sauntered into one of three food stores in her village and began perusing the isles, finding many other ponies looking as surprised as she felt. The batpony and seemingly most of her village didn't even recognise most of these new consumables, but they certainly wanted to try them. She shook her mane out of her eyes and added the usual weekly items to her basket before continuing to add several more foods she had never heard of, which was when she finally looked at the prices.\n\nShe spoke out loud in complete shock, “How much cheaper?

She had an odd look of elation on her face despite the generally stoic demeanour that she and the other lord and lady commanders usually wore. Alesia was quite excited herself, considering she hadn't yet had the opportunity to witness the legions in a setting where they weren't shooting at her.\n\nThere were somewhere between sixty and eighty creatures on the training field, performing a variety of exercises. Apparently these were new recruits, though she wouldn't have been able to tell. Their discipline was already seemingly unbreakable despite the fact that they had reportedly only been in the recruitment pipeline for a few weeks at this point.

So far, however, they had exceeded his expectations. His little platoon of zebras was excellently well turned-out in their dark uniforms. The feldfebel was still amazed that they could possibly stand the heat in all black. Then again, they were Zarantian zebras, natives to these arid climes, and he wasn't. He was very supportive of their retention of the sword as a weapon alongside the rifle, feeling it preserved some shred of honour. The old colt admired a warrior who had the courage to wield one on a modern battlefield.\n\nThe troops had now formed into two files. They were in the front room of the local army headquarters, and several bureaucrats and top brass officers were peering from their offices down the hall towards them, to see what the noise was about. On the wall in front of the squad was a newly-installed painting of Her Imperial Majesty, the Tsaritsa. The feldfebel roared 'Left FACE!', quickly followed by 'Pre-sent ARMS!' and it was done in under a second. 'At my command, you will salute your Tsaritsa and pledge loyalty to her as long as you may live! Sa-LUTE!' The platoon roared back, in their strongly accented voices; 'WE SALUTE YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, AND PLEDGE TO SERVE YOU UNTO DEATH!'\n\nAs they did, the underofficer dipped the colours and the feldfebel saluted with his sabre, following along with the salute and oath. As the echo from the hallway faded the feldfebel shouted,'Right then! Shoulder arms! Left face! By the left, quick march!' The platoon marched off, their hooves kicking characteristically high as they stepped. The feldfebel looked smugly at the desk workers withdrawing their heads back into their offices like snails into their shells. They were stuck here all day, pen-pushing and paper-stacking, yet he had the privilege to put his life on the line for Tsaritsa and company.

The Severyans argued that even a short-term reliance on slavery would hinder the economic growth across the tsardom, especially as Tobuck continues to industrialize.

This was a concept he supported in and of itself, but he hadn't quite prepared himself for the realities of the lowly and destitute.\n\nThe still-young noble had to watch silently as old, ill, disfigured and truly hurt ponies and zebras of all ages entered through the front door of the venue wearing tattered rags. He quickly got used to their awful smell the longer he served them food and acclimatised to the lack of respect as he took them to their beds. He knew now just how lucky he was to be born into his position and why the tsaritsa had demanded these measures. They ate as though they had never before eaten, slept as though they never had a bed and moved as though every part of their body was turning to dust.\n\nSeeing what he had seen, knowing what he knew now, he would never again neglect his duty to even the most detestable of Severyanian society. If only a small expenditure on his part could save lives and lost souls, it was the very least he could do."
tobuck_alesia.28.a:0 "That night, he vowed always to be kind."

tobuck_alesia.29.t:0 "To Each Their Rights"
tobuck_alesia.29.d:0 "“Lower the rent, up the pay! Lower the rent, up the pay! Lower the rent, up the pay!”\n\nThey just kept chanting and chanting. It had been a few days now since her tenant peasants had first refused to work the fields, but Serafina Nikolaeva was far from giving in to their demands. She was a noble and the Tsaritsa along with her personal security detail at the gate would protect her from this rabble of miserable wretches. Who were they to tell her how much she should pay and how much she should charge?\n\nJust as she had that thought, a familiar noise met her ears. A carriage, assumedly containing a judicial herald, and two trucks which would be carrying their soldiers. She stood up and trotted over to her mansion's front gate with a smug grin. The gaggle of peasants had heard too and the look of defeat on their faces was already present; now they would finally leave her in peace.\n\nWhen the carriage and its vehicular procession arrived, the herald and his soldiers exited quickly to meet both the now demoralised peasants and Serafina who had decided to greet them; thinking that she had already won.\n\nHowever, instead of exchanging pleasantries, the judicial herald cleared his throat and spoke; flanked by armed soldiers. “In the case brought to us by Lady Nikolaeya, the local judge and court has reached a verdict: Lady Nikoloaeya, you are found guilty of charging exploitative rent prices and underpaying your labour force. According to Her Majesty's decree, you must reimburse said labour force for the equivalent of six months' rent and double the salaries of these fine citizens.”\n\nUtter shock followed on both sides. Then the crowd erupted into cheers as the noblepony exploded with rage, hurling insults and threats at the herald until his entourage levelled their guns at her.\n\n“Madame, are you protesting the perfect law of Her Majesty and the Nightmare?” He asked simply, prompting her own guards to stand down."
tobuck_alesia.29.a:0 "Greed is what ruined Severyana."

tobuck_alesia.30.t:0 "At the Gala"
tobuck_alesia.30.d:0 "Her hoof was already rather tired from the number of hoofshakes she had offered. Between generals, nobles, industrialists and whoever else they had deemed important enough to invite they had already managed to tired out at least one of her appendages. That didn't bode well for the evening as a whole.\n\nAn older pony, ex-Severyanian military by the looks, suddenly took her attention away from the doors. “Your Majesty, I didn't have a chance to properly introduce myself on the way in! My name is Pyotr Luchnikov; here, I have a gift for you.”\n\nIn spite of the restrictions on weapons he had brought in a sword, likely by hiding it underneath his greatcoat in some way. The guards around them were already rushing to arrest him as he presented his weapon to the Tsaritsa, unsheathing it and offering the weapon as a gesture of fidelity. Before they could grab him, Alesia held up a hoof and ordered them to wait; even allowing herself to laugh at the absurdity of what he had just done.\n\nShe took the weapon, inspected it, sheathed it and then passed it back. “Your offer is kind and accepted, however I must ask why you decided to completely ignore our rule of no arms on the premises; was it in your interests to be arrested?”\n\n“I am of the opinion that such a rule is entirely unnecessary. Why should I, or any of your other loyal subjects for that matter, raise my weapon at my liege?” He asked rhetorically, rising from his bow.\n\nHer Majesty couldn't help but laugh a second time before waving away the guards."
tobuck_alesia.30.a:0 "“Pyotr, you shall dine at my table tonight!”"

tobuck_alesia.31.t:0 "Our New Home"
tobuck_alesia.31.d:0 "“Do you remember what the homeland was like?”\n\nYuliya turned her head to answer her husband as he stepped down from the tractor that he had fallen in love with over the past month.\n\nShe chuckled a little as the burly earth pony sauntered over, sweaty in spite of the machine doing most of the work. “Not much of the bad bits, but yes; a little. It's been a long time since we were young lovers running through the streets Koloda, time has flown by.”\n\nHe laughed loudly and practically threw himself onto a garden cushion, next to the lunch that his wife had just put on the garden table. They both sighed and stared at the Novaya Severyanian flag that he, in his patriotism, had attached to the back of the vehicle.\n\nThe pegasus mare chuckled and sat down next to him as he began to eat, savouring the taste of the food that had been made with their own crops along with some flowers that she had bought as a special treat. They had been relatively rich peasant famers in Equus, but was a far better that life had ever been in spite of the occupational similarities. The opportunity for a better life had called them here, now they were reaping the rewards of that making the right choices in that fateful time in their lives.\n\n“This is definitely better. Similar, but better.” Yuliya quietly added, nuzzling up to her husband."
tobuck_alesia.31.a:0 "“Mmm. I couldn't agree more.”"

tobuck_alesia.32.t:0 "Her Life's Work"
tobuck_alesia.32.d:0 "“That one goes above the rest. Yes, right there; so it almost goes over my collar and generally feels very uncomfortable to wear.” She gave out, directing a servant as to the correct position of a medal she didn't recognise.\n\nThe poor zebra looked petrified, “My apologies Your Majesty, I'm only familiar with Chiropterran distinctions. I'll make sure to broaden my knowledge for the future.”\n\nAlesia simply nodded and smiled, in as comforting a fashion as she could manage. There was no reason to punish a servant for this, they were still getting used to the new way of doing things after all. Much like herself, really. She still wasn't used to hearing the already-present cheers from the crowd in the palace grounds, she still wasn't used to being treated like royalty and she certainly still wasn't used to being treated like some sort of holy messenger from the Nightmare. But, as time went on, she felt more at home here as a ruler and a guiding figure. It was hard, but it was rewarding.\n\nThere was much to do yet, eradicating communism and securing her borders in a more permanent fashion were the two things that sprung to mind immediately. For today however, those goals could wait. For today, she could enjoy herself.\n\n“Your Highness, we're finished.” The zebra said quietly, a smile forming on his face.\n\nShe made a little bow in thanks before stepping towards the window doors and the balcony. The Tsaritsa steadied herself before throwing them open and receiving an onslaught of cheers and prayers from her adoring subjects."
tobuck_alesia.32.a:0 "Glory to the Tsaritsa!"

tobuck_alesia.33.t:0 "Novaya Severyana's Overture"
tobuck_alesia.33.d:0 "An urgent telegram from Novaya Severyana has reached us, proposing an interesting arrangement. They wish to align themselves with our government in a formal military alliance with the primary goal of confiscating Hippogriffia's mainland territories. For our efforts we shall receive part of Zumidia, as they will; an equal share of territory in the event of our victory.\n\nNovaya Severyana is an autocratic, zealous and nationalistic state which is currently governed by the Tsaritsa Alesia whose power is absolute; they worship the Nightmare and proselytise their religion to any zebra they can get their hooves on. Whilst this may make them a potential ideological threat in the future, their military prowess and successes in recent conflicts suggest that the risk may be worthwhile taking. So long as we respect Tsaritsa Alesia and her personal endeavours, which she has insinuated shall not interfere with our own interests, they may prove themselves invaluable.\n\nWhat shall our response be?"
tobuck_alesia.33.a:0 "Shake hooves with this 'Tsaritsa'."
tobuck_alesia.33.b:0 "Disregard the deal."

tobuck_alesia.34.t:0 "Colthage Accepts"
tobuck_alesia.34.d:0 "Tsaritsa Alesia and [CTH.GetLeader] stood proudly upon a podium outside of a cathedral in the capital, surrounded by a number of photographers and reporters. It was a great day for the new monarch and her citizens, as it was for [CTH.GetLeader] and the Colthaginians.\n\nThe Severyan Axis represented a new and competitive force in Northern Zebrica, aligned in their goal of removing hippogriff influence from the continent. [HIP.GetLeader], leader of our uniting enemy, will no doubt speak out against us for our openly hostile rhetoric; but it is already far too late for them to establish an opposing alliance."
tobuck_alesia.34.a:0 "Our victory shall be swift and glorious."

tobuck_alesia.35.t:0 "Colthage Rejects"
tobuck_alesia.35.d:0 "Alesia could hardly think for the ruckus that her generals were causing.\n\nThe rejection of their offer of a formal alliance had thrown their plans wildly off course. Curses and insults were being thrown around the war room, directed primarily at [CTH.GetLeader] for making such an idiotic decision.\n\nThough equally as frustrated as the officers that packed the room, the Tsaritsa was nevertheless determined to complete the task she had laid out. Hippogriffia represented a serious threat to her regime and now, she realised, so did Colthage. The royal mare slammed a hoof down on one of the wooden desks to bring the room's attention to her.\n\n“Inaction is tantamount to defeat. Modify our invasion plans to account for this setback and continue preparations; now that they are aware of our intentions they will begin to reorganise, we must strike now or we may not have another chance at success.”\n\nTheir rage had not disappeared, but she had given them focus; Novaya Severyana would not be humiliated. They would prove themselves worthy of the Nightmare."
tobuck_alesia.35.a:0 "Colthage will pay for this insolence, in due time."

tobuck_alesia.36.t:0 "Blessed of the Moon"
tobuck_alesia.36.d:0 "“Your victory in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds is proof of our error and of the Nightmare's blessing upon you. We are willing to announce our support for you and the bloodshed shall cease, if you are willing to accept our gracious offer and sincere apology. Should you acquiesce, the legions will likely cease their activity within a few days when they hear of our support for your regime.” She quickly added.\n\nThe pair had not expected this. The Moonspeaker's reasoning was muddy at best; but then they did have to justify such a crushing defeat to their people as well as to their own faith. Lunar Hail herself commanded a legion, which gave further credence to their earnestness; even then, Alesia could see the desperation hidden behind their eyes.\n\nEntin thrust a hoof into her side and gave her a pained look, “Please tell me you're not one of these insane Nightmare worshippers.”\n\nShe stayed silent. Her parents had been and, though she had never fully accepted their faith, she had never been entirely opposed to it either. She wasn't, but maybe she would have to be. Maybe.\n\n“Please, I deserve at least an answer.” He pleaded.\n\nShe shot down his request with a harsh glare and turned, lifting her head to the clear night sky to stare at the dim stars and the moon emerging from a small cloud; hoping silently that he could forgive her for this. It was the only way forward, a rule ordained by a Goddess she wasn't even faithful to.\n\nAlesia sighed and nodded, “I accept your blessing.”"
tobuck_alesia.36.a:0 "She would lord over these lands, by grace of fate or the Nightmare."

tobuck_alesia.37.t:0 "A Nation on Two Contients"
tobuck_alesia.37.d:0 "With all the great successes of the Tsaritsa, one question remains. Shall our great state retain the current centre of administration in Snezhnograd, or return in full to the original capital in Princessyn?\n\nWhilst it may initially seem like an obvious choice, many years have been spent developing and industrialising our Zebrican territories. That alongside the inherent difficulties of moving the entire administration to a different continent over vast nautical distances makes the prospect similarly less inviting. However, it would likewise be remiss of the Tsaritsa and nobility not to truly restore Severyana to its prior glory.\n\nIt is a question of practicality against ideological obligation, and one that must be answered."
tobuck_alesia.37.a:0 "We must restore Princessyn, as we have restored Severyana."
tobuck_alesia.37.b:0 "Snezhnograd is a national symbol, we will not abandon it!"

tobuck_alesia.38.t:0 "An Intercontinental Homecoming"
tobuck_alesia.38.d:0 "Sitting in the car and waiting to arrive, she could only hope that it would be worth it. Persuading the remnants of her family to travel to an entirely new continent had been no easy task, especially as it had seemed to them to merely be trading one kind of exile for another. But, after a long and arduous discussion over telegrams and letters, her aunt and brother had eventually agreed to at least stay for a while.\n\nThe car slowed to a stop, Alesia thanked her chauffeur and trotted the last few metres until the docks. Soldiers had been sparsely placed around, though she was in little danger here in Firstport. After all, the Chiropterrans loved her.\n\nAs she descended a ramp with two guards from the gate following in tow the earth pony rested her eyes on the ship in which her family must have just arrived. It certainly wasn't a grand entrance, but then she couldn't expect the exiles to buy much better than the converted Severyanan destroyer they had brought. She would have taken a moment to compose herself properly, if it weren't for the fact that she had just seen the new arrivals on the docks.\n\nThe Tsartisa smiled and made quick pace, noticed first by her aunt who bowed low as would be appropriate for such royalty.\n\n“Your majesty.” She said simply as her niece returned the gesture in kind.\n\nHer brother, young and simply happy to see her, immediately dashed over for a hug. “Alesia! Oh it's been so long... Aunt Karina and I were just talking about you.”\n\n“And about what the correct etiquette for greeting royalty was, Maksim.” The middle-aged mare added pointedly.\n\nThe monarch simply chuckled, “Manners can come after we get you two settled.”"
tobuck_alesia.38.a:0 "It was good to see family again."

tobuck_alesia.39.t:0 "Karina's Faith"
tobuck_alesia.39.d:0 "“It was very kind of you to come and visit your highness, but I'm sure you have more important matters to attend to than your ageing aunt.”\n\nKarina did have somewhat of a point there, she definitely did have more pressing things to be doing, but it had been a very long time since she had last seen her family. This was the least the Tsaritsa could do to make up for lost time.\n\nAlesia took a sip of tea from her porcelain cup and smiled, “I do have things to be doing, but that doesn't mean I can ignore the head of the family. Even if I hadn't any obligation to visit you I think it more than appropriate to ensure that you feel comfortable in your lodgings. I don't suppose you've attended church, have you?”\n\n“Actually, I have.” she quickly corrected, no longer afraid to admit her ardent belief in the Nightmare. “It's not what I was expecting.”\n\nThe monarch raised an inquisitive eyebrow and took another sip, simply waiting for her aunt to elaborate on the subject. She was very much aware of the mare's leanings and needed to do very little in order to encourage her.\n\nWith a contemplative frown, Karina nodded. “Yes, it was quite something; especially being so used to our typically private worship in Equestria. The thestrals certainly know what they're doing.”\n\n“And will you attend again?” Alesia asked, curious more than anything else.\n\n“I think I shall. I suppose you've been going to church all the time with such freedom, haven't you? Perhaps your brother and I should have come sooner.” She admitted with a slight scoff at herself."
tobuck_alesia.39.a:0 "'All the time' was quite an assumption..."

tobuck_alesia.40.t:0 "Maksim's Feelings"
tobuck_alesia.40.d:0 "The siblings sat at the dinner table playing poker, their meals long since finished and the cutlery and crockery whisked away by a servant. They had both missed nights like these, simply enjoying one another's company with a deck of cards and chatting as they tried to figure out if their opponent was bluffing. It made for a good challenge.\n\n“Karina seems to really love this place y'know. Says it gives her nostalgia for the old days before the reds came along.” He gave out whilst dealing.\n\nAlesia chuckled, “Not surprising really, it's starting to look a lot more like home over here. What do you think about my glorious Novaya Severyana?” She asked, deliberately emphasising her final words for a laugh.\n\n“I raise.” Maksim said first, pushing in some makeshift chips after observing the flop. “Well, it's... Interesting. I'm not sure if I feel comfortable living here with so many... Well, you know; fanatics, I guess. They're all really into this whole Nightmare thing and... Well, I suppose I'm kinda like you actually. I don't really know where I stand, but I don't think it's with them.”\n\nShe nodded and put even more 'chips' in herself, “I raise. Well, nopony's going to confront you about it; especially not with me around to make doubly sure nothing happens. You can always go home if you like.”\n\n“I don't know yet. Maybe I could get used to it, and spending time with you again is... really nice. Mmm...” He spent a moment thinking, face almost completely emotionless at the turn. “I raise.”\n\nThe Tsaritsa tilted her head. “I check.”\n\n“Oh? Hmm. I raise.” He added after revealing the river.\n\n“I raise.”\n\n“There's no chance you beat a straight flush, surely?”"

tobuck_military.1.d:0 "It was hardly a surprise that the mercenaries were harping on about their pay. Technically speaking they were on the payroll of the state, but Pea Shooter had failed to actually provide any sort of funding. This issue needed resolving as soon as possible, lest the commanders run out of surplus loot to tide over their soldiers with.\n\nTwo ideas had been proposed, one from the troops themselves and another from their generals. The former simply wanted to be paid in regular money as they were having difficulties making use of their spoils of war when trying to buy goods in stores or in sending cash back to their families; their solution was merely to finalise the state contracts and earn their keep that way. Their officers meanwhile had other ideas, instead suggesting that their pay should be granted in the form of shares in state-owned mining companies. That way they could slowly earn more over time as the businesses expanded, leading to a greater eventual payday.\n\nBoth concepts were viable, leaving the decision ultimately up to the administration."

Now, the only thing left on the agenda is to sell them and should they run out, we can always get a bit creative in wielding the power of a state we plan to give away.\n\nFor Pea Shooter however, it only matters insofar that he can funnel laundered money out of Tobuck. With his family out of danger and with no knowledge of his current business venture in Manehattan, he cannot just load a boat full of gold bars and piles of dirty cash and hope that Equestrian customs won't raise an eyebrow.

### Ideas ###

TBK_fake_republic:0 "The Fake Republic"
TBK_fake_republic_desc:0 "Tobuck! A free, modern and sovereign republic! The only issue is that no Tobuckian actually wanted one. Or rather, the few who did want one certainly didn't want some gun runner to run it. In a land that happily thrived under a monarchy, the announcement of the republic landed like a cannonball shot with not enough gunpowder: making a big “thud” in the mud.\n\nIn the end, nopony was really fooled by the proclamation of the republic, even the Hippogriffian and Maregyptian ambassadors who were still happy to give lip service to the idea that Chiropterra, Warzena and Zarantia ought to think twice about moving in. But bits help smooth things over and a fake republic has a way of streamlining government decision."

TBK_warlord_reliance:0 "Warlord Reliance"
TBK_warlord_reliance_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to make their job of defending the country easier and while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords."

TBK_zarantian_loyalism:0 "Zarantian Loyalism"
TBK_zarantian_loyalism_desc:0 "A former Warzenan province, Tobuck soured on its historical master for many a reason. And so, when queens of the desert came and liberated them, they embraced her as their savior. It proved a successful choice as the Zarantian wished for a richer region to use as their center of power. The Storm King brought an end to the promising future of the Kingdom of Zarantia and Tobuck had its fate decided for them by a clique of innovative businesscreatures as they call themselves. In the end, it's not hard to understand why the merchants and citizens of Tobuck have a nostalgia for the Zebra Queen of the east. And should Mekiouzza come for them, they will help her."

TBK_home_act:0 "The Home Act"
TBK_home_act_desc:0 "The republic is nothing if not cooperative, especially regarding the Zarantians. It’s only fair, and practical of course, that we have allowed for the free movement of peoples over the Tobuckian-Zarantian border; with a little luck, this should keep the tribes off of our backs for a while longer too."

TBK_republic_guard:0 "Guard Security Operations"
TBK_republic_guard_desc:0 "If the events of the past few months have proven anything, it’s that allowing the national guard jurisdiction over the movement of peoples was a fantastic idea. We must keep the Zarantian intellectuals in the city, and of course make sure that the warlords remain blissfully ignorant for a little longer."

TBK_spy_warlords:0 "Ears Amongs the Bands"
TBK_spy_warlords_desc:0 "Trying to get coherent information out of warlords is a notoriously difficult affair, one which isn’t really worth the effort when they all have their own aims. Instead we have dispersed a number of individuals amongst the rank and file of the warlord bands in the hopes that we can spread misinformation and add to the confusion just a little more."

### Vasile ideas

TBK_warlord_anarchy:0 "Warlord Bands"
TBK_warlord_anarchy_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to male their job of defending the country easier. And while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords.\n\nThe recent chaos following Pea Shooter's disappearence has broken all trust between the warlords and central government, leading to total anarchy within the countryside."

But bits help smooth things over and a fake republic has a way of streamlining government decision.\n\nTL;DR add in a small blurb that explains how recent elections has increased internal support a bit though allegations of electoral corrpution and ballot stuffing are thrown around."

Any prisoner who participates is given meager pay and their sentences are shortened if they participate. Should be written in a very positive note."

TBK_false_corruption_charges:0 "Reformed Laws"
TBK_false_corruption_charges_desc:0 "TL;DR Vasile uses his executive powers to streamline and reform an actual set of laws, with some being remnants from Pea administration and some traditional tribal laws.\n\nA massive anti-corruption campaign is launched in the republic.

TBK_destroyed_republic:0 "Destroyed Republic"
TBK_destroyed_republic_desc:0 "Though it was little more than a sham to begin with, the republic at least maintained some semblance of stability. Since it's official dissolution the state has been under considerable duress as rapid changes rock Tobuck."

### Wallnut path ideas

TBK_social_visionary:0 "Visioranism"
TBK_social_visionary_desc:0 "Whoever said that whatever we look at now is what we should be seein'? There's nothing wrong with a lil' experimentation, especially not if it's at the expense of whichever establishment decides to try and censor it! Come on lads, show 'em what you can do!"

TBK_bat_propaganda:0 "Horrors of Chiropterra"
TBK_bat_propaganda_desc:0 "Whatever folks might say about Chiropterra is probably true, even the worst of rumours could well have some sorta basis in that tartarus-hole of a country. Still, makes us fight all the harder to make well sure they don't get their hooves on us an' our families, eh?"

TBK_pride_work:0 "Worker's Pride"
TBK_pride_work_desc:0 "Unlike that nasty 'Labourer' system the Chiropterrans seem so fond of, our own workers are more than capable of takin' pride in their own creations and bein' well paid for 'em! Ain't nothing like a little reward for a good day's work in the factory!"

### Wallnut harmony ideas

TBK_democratic_vision:0 "Democratization"
TBK_democratic_vision_desc:0 "Bringing democracy to a place like Tobuck, and Chiropterra for that matter, is no easy task. In fact, it’s probably one of the single hardest things any government has tried to implement around these parts. All the same, these things need to happen in order for Harmony and a truly democratic environment to be achieved."

TBK_harmonic_federation:0 "Balance of Power"
TBK_harmonic_federation_desc:0 "Trying to make things work between two opposed ideals is always hard, but it’s not impossible. With a little luck and a little more careful work we can make sure that the balance of power remains and that politics stay fine and dandy. After all, the least we can do for all our revolutionary reforms is attempt not to make a mess in the process."

TBK_repayment:0 "Repayments"
TBK_repayment_desc:0 "Though many see such expenses as frivolous and an insult as most of the money is going to those that just tried to annex our beloved city, the fact remains that we are now a nation of many Chiropterrans as well as Tobuckians. If we wish them to integrate peacefully into our society then we must encourage them to stay and to cooperate with the state."

TBK_open_elections:0 "Campaign Season"
TBK_open_elections_desc:0 "Ah, election campaigns; for once they’re not even rigged in favour of the incumbency! It’s our duty to make sure every creature in the federation has a say in one way or another; the best way to do that is making sure they know who they can vote for, right?"

TBK_democratic_vision_final:0 "The Constitution of U.L.N.Z"
TBK_democratic_vision_final_desc:0 "Codifying a constitution is an integral part of guaranteeing the rights of citizens as well as ensuring that the functionality of and balance of power within the government cannot simply be overturned. Democratic harmony is a perfect and malleable answer to all future questions, after all."

TBK_ulz_police_lar:0 "National Police Force"
TBK_ulz_police_lar_desc:0 "Tobuck was never a safe place and the military police that Chiropterra relied on in order to keep the peace weren’t exactly an enticing organisation to utilise. Harmony is now protected by our loyal police constables and their hard work in keeping the country safe from internal elements of discontent and malpractice."

Townhouses and ministries have turned into battlefields between Dusk's unions and Niftyn's party, spilling out to the streets in the townships and cities.

TBK_nic:0 "National Identity Card"
TBK_nic_desc:0 "The concept of a National Identity Card is fairly simple in concept and in application, but it has important benefits far beyond simply making our citizens identifiable.

TBK_unions_pride:0 "Unions' Pride"
TBK_unions_pride_desc:0 "The question that so often arises when nationalism is thrown out of the picture is how any creature is supposed to take pride in themselves and their nation.

TBK_worker_equality:0 "Home of the Workers"

Despite holding no discernable political view or ambition of his own, he just helps smooth things over. He's just that nice!

TBK_moonspeaker_union_advisor_desc:0 "Much to Niftyn's dismay, Dusk Wane has successfully established a new advisory body within the government of the federation. As its name would suggest, it is a collection of moonspeakers that have left-leaning sympathies or at have the intelligence and spine to support their fellow moonspeaker in the administration. Isn't it marvellous what religion can do for a nation?"
TBK_wallnut_resources_ministry:0 "Comission of Strategic Resources"
TBK_wallnut_resources_ministry_desc:0 "Much to Dusk Wane's dismay, Niftyn has successfully established a new advisory body within the government of the federation. As its name would suggest, it is a collection of industrial and mining experts with a sprinkling of military officials tasked with ensuring that the nation is ready for war at all times. Who better than the specialists to make sure everything is in order?"
TBK_copper_spark:0 "Copper Spark"
TBK_copper_spark_desc:0 "A staunch communist in Tobuck was always going to become a friend of Niftyn's given enough time and Copper Spark as both a talented young officer and political activist was no exception. Most know him for his unwavering commitment to his cause, but the administration recognises his ruthless efficiency; this observation is so widely shared between factions that it has quickly become tradition ask 'how's the wife?' in reference to his similarly brutal friend Tarnished Silver."
TBK_rusted_nut:0 "Rusted Nut"
TBK_rusted_nut_desc:0 "It wasn't exactly hard to convince an underpaid inspector of the benefits of socialist industry, but what was surprising was the very real skill that he displayed. As time went on he gradually established himself as a very important contributer to the Stallionist bloc within the administration, emphasising the importance of workplace conformity and the necessity of frequent evaluations."
TBK_wired_guide:0 "Wired Guide"
TBK_wired_guidedesc:0 "Talented scientists can be hard to come by and ones with the intellectual capacity of Wired Guide perhaps some of the rarest ponies in the known world. Needless to say that as soon as Niftyn happened across the young mare, he immediately set about grooming her into the perfect visionary for his Stallionist dreams. Though she has become somewhat of a demagogue, she never lost sight of her true passion for science."
TBK_brass_badge:0 "Brass Badge"
TBK_brass_badge_desc:0 "By all accounts Brass Badge is a truly kind and well-loved constable, one who always puts the needs of others above his own both at work and at home. Dusk Wane has seen fit to promote him to the national authority on all matters police, making him and his system of local constabularies two uniquely difficult things to oppose within the administration."
TBK_tarnished_silver:0 "Tarnished Silver"
TBK_tarnished_silver_desc:0 "Tarnished Silver is a good friend of Cooper Spark for a reason. Not only is she a terrifying force in her own right - high functioning sociopaths can be as unnerving as they are tenacious and deadly - but the ISS has proven to be a morbidly effective institution. Yet, to their credit, the job is always done and it is always done well; no witnesses and no loose ends, we should perhaps consider limiting their powers at some point in the future."
TBK_yeva_advisor:0 "Comrade Yeva"
TBK_yeva_advisor_desc:0 "Comrade Yeva initially struggled to adapt to North Zebrica, what with it being so different from Stalliongrad and the language barrier; but having spent some time in the federation she can truly claim to be well-adjusted. Indeed she has taken it upon herself to run the local youth organisations for Niftyn's Hazrumenian Communist Party and is well loved by parents across the nation, mostly because she lets them get away from their foals for a few hours a day."

TBK_Yarikh:0 "Yarikh"
TBK_Yarikh_desc:0 "Having had his land appropriated by the reformist government in Warzena, Yarikh spent a long time in exile living off of the remainder of his coffers in the hopes that one day he will have his lands restored. Luckily for him, a certain zebra has offered to restore his properties and privileges in return for his fielty and service. What more could a bored and disheartened exile ask for?"
TBK_Jetzabel:0 "Jetzabel"
TBK_Jetzabel_desc:0 "Lowborn nobles are not often known to work alongside crown princes, but needs must. Jetzabel has long been chastised from Warzenan court thanks to her opportunism regarding several property claims to non-Leopard holdings. In her eagerness to acquire more wealth and land for herself, she has aligned with Baragzen in an attempt to make the most out of a coming conflict between the remnants of the Leopard dynasty and the current rulers of Warzena."

### Materiel Designers

TBK_Starting_Gun:0 "Cityside Rifles"
TBK_Starting_Gun_desc:0 "Cityside Rifles is one of the oldest materiel companies in Tobuck and has a long and storied history of collaborating with outsiders, something that has generally fostered an unhappy relationship between this company and the public. Despite their trials and tribulations, they remain an incredibly skilled manufacturing business; though employing them for state companies may draw the ire of the people."
TBK_Starting_Arty:0 "HighCal Plants"
TBK_Starting_Arty_desc:0 "Originally a subsidiary of Cityside Rifles, HighCal Plants developed an industry specialisation after the reign of the Storm King fell apart. After some time they became an independent company following a long and arduous legal case that was eventually resolved by the Tobuckian warlords who threatened to sieze Cityside Rifle assests personally if the artillery production lines remained lifeless."

TBK_moon_rifle_corporation:0 "Moon Rifle Corporation"
TBK_moon_rifle_corporation_desc:0 "The Moon Rifle Corporation is a conglomeration of several materiel designers that has been created in service of Alesia. She will have her equipment and those that provid it will be rewarded generously for their services."

TBK_zamivgazal_steelsingers:0 "Most Honourable Order of Steelsingers"
TBK_zamivgazal_steelsingers_desc:0 "There is a beauty in the sound of metalwork that few can truly appreciate. It is an artisanal craft unlike any other to be practiced by the most talented and gifted of craftscreatures the land has to offer and maintaining such a status of import is the charge of the Steelsingers. His Majesty shall have his beautiful furnaces and metalwork!"
TBK_leopard_tires:0 "Leopard Tires Ltd"
TBK_leopard_tires_desc:0 "The importance of rubber and of wheels is an often overlooked facet of modern warfare and it is something upon which His Majesty seeks to profit and provide. Who better to purchase tires from than from the dynastic company?"

### Navy Designers

TBK_Starting_Navy:0 "Imperial Marine"
TBK_Starting_Navy_desc:0 "Though the naval tradition in Tobuck is limited, the light ship companies established by the Storm King retain a surprisingly effective string of dockyards that should be more than capable of supplying the state with credible new-age technology for use in our navy."

### Air Designers

TBK_Starting_Fighters:0 "Thunderclap"
TBK_Starting_Fighters_desc:0 "Though their humble beginnings as naught but local textile workers drafted into manufacturing airship frabics are long over, the Thunderclap company remains if only in name. They are proud and talented engineers, a business known for their intelligence and their innovativeness in a world that requires their talents."
TBK_Starting_CAS:0 "Stormside Inc."
TBK_Starting_CAS_desc:0 "Much like their companions at Thunderclap, the origins of Stormside Incorporated can be traced back to the requirements for ground attack from the air in the designs of the Storm King. Though they are not so well rehearsed in modern fighter doctrines, there has been little to stop their cooperation with old corporate friends in making new air support."

### Tank Designers

TBK_Starting_Tank:0 "Zufra Steelworks"
TBK_Starting_Tank_desc:0 "Though not a tank producer by day, the Zufra Steelworks have created a market niche for themselves as producers of high quality metals and specifically of sprockets; the kind that could be easily retooled for military usage. Whilst unprepared to deal with heavier design specifications, they will have no problems providing the state with the means to produce light armour."

TBK_royal_severyan_rd:0 "Royal Severyan R&D"
TBK_royal_severyan_rd_desc:0 "Tanks are not exactly a well understood development to the Tobuckian military, even the Zufra Steelworks could tell you that, but under the guidance of the Tsaritsa they shall become a thing of beauty and of incredible power. Long may she reign!"

### Concerns

TBK_industrial_concern_generic:0 "Tobuck C&C"
TBK_industrial_concern_generic_desc:0 "Tobuck has always been a centre of industrial development and in particular its metalworking plants that has long facilitated the more complex machining work. The expertise of Tobuck C&C may provide state enterprises with incredible insight into technological development in that area."
TBK_industrial_concern_generic_2:0 "Darnaigh Eletronics"
TBK_industrial_concern_generic_2_desc:0 "Though Darnaigh remains relatively underdeveloped in terms of industry, the area does bear fruits from the efforts of Zarantian tribal leaders. Despite lacking much in the way of population, Darnaigh has managed to become a centre of electronic development in Tobuck and may provide much needed insight into that realm of technology."

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of November 962 in St.Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between St. Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle-aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family's business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severyanian counter-revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil Cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun-runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

Wallnut Drive has always been both a famous and infamous individual, the former amongst his large circle of friends and the latter amongst his equally large group of enemies. Though he is incredibly personable and a delight to be around in general, his escape from Chiropterra during his brief stint in service with the legionnaires has left a particularly large target on his back. If the legions got their hooves on him now, he’d be on the chopping block.\n\nLucky for ‘the tricky thestral’ then that he has many friends that are willing to harbour and protect him, like Pea Shooter who was more than happy to hire a warlord with a distaste for one of the biggest security threats to his operation. His characteristic smile and capacity to converse even in matters far beyond his intellectual capacity make him a truly loveable pony, despite his typically accidental aloofness.\n\nHe’s well known for his rousing speeches, capacity to command, his love of drink and partying and his hatred of Chiropterra, something that drives him to do great things to this very day. A common joke amongst his ranks is that the only thing their general can’t do is talk to mares which, though none of them have seen him try, is entirely accurate.\n\nThough he may be a wanted criminal just across the border, Wallnut Drive is never one to shy away from a fight; nor is he one to pass up an opportunity to party, even at the most inconvenient of times. He is most of all a rebel with a big heart.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrub"

baragzen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July 975 in Zammar\n\n§YBiography§!: Baragzen is an exiled noble hailing originally from Warzena and now residing in Tobuck with dreams of one day returning to his home country. Much of his early life was spent in courtly education and becoming accustomed to his role as the heir to the head of the Leopard dynasty Waseem, his father. Most seemed to think that the family had been kept away from rule for so long that they were no longer relevant and Waseem seemingly agreed.\n\nAs he grew older, the young zebra began to slowly drift away from his family's dynastic policy of simple acceptance and instead started preparing for his family's 'inevitable' return to power. When his father passed, he became head of the family to little opposition or applause; his mother, Raaniya, attempted to persuade him to abandon his dreams of ascending the throne which resulted in a heated falling out. With no support even within his own immediate family, he ran away with a large part of the family coffers.\n\nThis would land him - and the significant amount of wealth he managed to smuggle out - in Tobuck which was a hotbed of instability and conflict during and following the rule of Storm King. There he would raise a small private army, one which grew rapidly as his renown and skill became widely known amongst mercenary circles. His success came partly from a natural talent which was being explored at the time of his exile in a military academy, but it was additionally thanks to the absolute loyalty that he commanded in his soldiers. He treated them with respect and dignity, even going so far as to enter the fray himself when his force was much smaller and commanding from the field.\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Storm King's realm and the establishment of Tobuck, Pea Shooter hired him in essence to ensure that he couldn't cause any trouble. Now Baragzen thrives as a warlord, commanding an irregular but disciplined force. He still hopes to return to Warzena and reclaim his birthright, but only time and a little luck will tell if he can achieve that dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

TBK_clam_chowder_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of September 973 in Applelaide\n\n§YBiography§!: Clam Chowder is, like almost all mercenaries in Tobuck, a foreigner. Born in far away New Mareland, she enlisted in the navy there as soon as her age permitted it but was repeatedly turned down for promotions thanks to her difficult relationship with whichever superior was unlucky enough to have her on board. Eventually her attitude would get her discharged which prompted her to steal a ship, a story she refuses to give details on, and sail off to find a navy in which her skill would be appreciated and where discipline was more of a suggestion.\n\nDespite initially seeing her arrival in Tobuck as an opportunity to make a name for herself, the mare has mellowed significantly over the years. Needless to say that she has also become a better and significantly more professional commander as a result, but she still dreams of commanding a larger flotilla than the pitiful number of ships in the Tobuckian fleet. She may yet get her wish.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_great_pyre_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of June 954 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: A selfless duty does not always bring glory and rewards to a soldier. Great Pyre witnessed this in 995, during the Severyana Revolution, where he fought as a sergeant in the Royal Guard. Only to be let go amongst other soldiers and officers for their actions in the fight against the communist revolutionaries. Instead of a peaceful life in Equestria, Great Pyre, bitter to the princess, left Equestria in the ranks of his fellow soldiers and joined with them in Zebrica as mercenaries, fighting not for glory but cold-hard cash.\n\n Yet service in the grand mercenary company was not enough for the ambitious stallion and he, with a core cadre of subordinates and local recruits, left to form their own mercenary band. This groud soon gained a ferocious reputation for their brutality and callous regard for life, bot theirs and the enemies. Rumours continued to swell, until across Northern Zebrica the company was dubbed the Band of Flayers: a name originally meant to mock their lust for loot to the point of looting the dead admist battle, Great Pyre eagerly adopted the name and further modified it by adding to it a motto. One which all members of the Band of Flayers adhered to.\n\n Down to the last fur!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_entin_miron_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of October 970 in St. Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Entin Miron is, in many ways, much like his commanding officer and friend Alesia Snezhnaya. He served in the Severyanan armed forces alongside her, spending years together in the academy and fighting the red rebels during the revolution. Intelligent, brave and dedicated; when observing the two working together many assume that the pair are related despite the differences in appearance.\n\nThough some believe otherwise, it was not the money or the loyalty to the exile cause that drove him to Zebrica. In fact, rather aptly, it was by her request that he boarded a ship and set sail for the southernmost continent. They have spent years in the north of the continent, fighting through innumerable wars including those waged in vain against the Storm King.\n\nThough he is skilled and, privately, wishes for a higher position in the military; most importantly he wants to look after his friend, no matter what she may get herself into.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_pyotr_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of February 957 in Princessyn\n\n§YBiography§!: Pyotr is a pony of much mystery, yet of great renown. Little is known of his service in Severyana beyond the fact that he was retired at the outset of the revolution and was called back into service for its duration. Having heard of Alesia's great successes in Zebrica he saw no reason not to see the great resurgence of his homeland abroad for himself.\n\nThough his strategy is outdated, his manner and personality are a welcome departure from the seriousness of modern war. Already he has made many genuine friends amongst the emerging nobility and the court, including the Tsartisa herself who has taken quite a liking to the old Stallion.\n\nMany wonder whether he has any real goals or even a desire for promotion, but really he seems to be having a wonderful time as is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

TBK_cherry_bomb_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of June 972 in Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!:Cherry Bomb's family had made fireworks for generations, and nopony expected him to do anything else. At least not until the explosion. A giant novelty firecracker went off in his face when he was twelve, leaving him with a severe concussion, damaged hearing and a nervous twitch that never quite went away. Yet where others saw an accident, Cherry Bomb found his purpose.\n\nExperimenting with more and more extreme forms of explosives, he soon changed profession to developing explosives for the Equestrian military, only to be disillusioned with them as well due to their conservative approach. Instead, he left for abroad to offer his services as a freelancer. Whether it's in New Mareland blowing up Cockatrice nests, trying to sell the Brodfeld monarchy a new line of explosives or hobnobbing with Colthaginian patricians to secure funding for private arms factories, Cherry Bomb has done it all, and he prides himself on bringing explosions from the factory to the field.\n\nHis crew is a wild mix of all sorts of people, with Cherry Bomb having few qualms about who he works with. If you love explosives as much as he does, you'll have a job with his crew as they continue in their quest to discover and make use of every explosive in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_spell_stock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st October 979 in Northern Wittenland\n\n§YBiography§!: Spell Stock was always a troublemaker, even as a child, and age has not mellowed him out. Though of noble Wittenlandic birth and great wealth, his proclivities - causing scandals wherever he went, harassing the serfs by sniping at them from his palace and hunting monsters rather than tending to his property - were always an eyesore even for the other nobles. It all came to a head with White Star's ascension to the throne. Many had hoped she'd put him straight, but instead Spell Stock surrendered his property to the crown for a sizable sum and left Wittenland.\n\nTaking to the road, he used his wealth to build up a cadre of fellow hunters with the goal to hunt every monster the world had seen. Yet, in a steadily worsening world, he started to wonder if it wasn't the sapient creatures who were the true monsters. If it was, that meant that his hunting list had expanded something fierce. What more, it turned out being a mercenary paid better than a freelance hunter.\n\nHaving just finished a stint in Skyfall, he's arrived in Zebrica with a brand new "Rarity For You" suit, a vastly expanded hunting cadre and a plan to get himself trophies of every kind of threatening beast the continent can offer, and why yes that ambiguity was quite intentional.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

He could have become a legend, but he made the mistake of going after the crime organisation known as the Tiger Syndicate. Though he scored several victories against them, corruption and moles within his unit led to him almost dying after being seduced by the wife of the Tiger Syndicate's leader.\n\nBarely escaping with his life, he saw how the fight against the syndicate slowly died out without him and bitterly concluded that they had patrician backing. He abandoned Colthage and has since become a gun for hire under the moniker "Captain Z". It was what he did best, and he liked doing it, so he decided it was time to make money off it instead of bleeding for a nation that seemed so willing to discard him.\n\nWhat more, one day he might have the money and the soldiers needed to go back and finish what he started. It's some ways off yet, but he's got a long time. The dead are patient, after all. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_oborin_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March 985 in Ravenskoye \n\n§YBiography§!: In truth, Oborin was nothing more than a junior officer at one of the Stalliongradian naval academies. Though talented, his career had hardly even started when he was given the offer of going overseas to some backwater state in Zebrica. Maybe it was his yearning for action, his barely-kempt brazenness or even the desire to impress his commanders; but he accepted the call to action nonetheless.\n\nHe was greeted with a small navy on arrival and a pang of disappointment when he realised why the senior officers hadn't been given this position overseas. Yet, thanks to assurances from Wallnut and some of his other staff, the young admiral is hopeful. Perhaps he'll amount to greatness yet, much to the assumed annoyance of his superiors back at home.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_Myrga_Draconis_Desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of June 792 in a cave \n\n§YBiography§!: Historically there have always been two things that successfully coax dragons from their caves: the promise of immense power or the draw of incredible wealth. Though desires for these things are most commonly exhibited in younger beasts who are yet to establish themselves, on occasion it will entice much older creatures to retire their positions of responsibility in search of personal glory. It was this very phenomenon that brought Myrga to Tobuck.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as a hatchery guard, a station notorious amongst dragons for the boredom it begets, the stench of overseas blood and money was nothing less than intoxicating. The death of the Storm King was an unspoken cue to visit, drawing the dragon overseas to the riches of the weapons trade and the conflicts that flared up as the remnant yeti forces were gradually ousted.\n\nThough initially scorned as a monster by contemporary generals, it soon became clear that he was curiously talented in complex matters of strategy despite his size and temprament. To the surprise of many, he has become better known for his protective nature and warding roar rather than his wartime brutality and occasionally overwhelming bloodlust.\n\nEven now, as a leader, he always has an excuse to dive personally into the fray. Luckily for us he's easy to keep on side, especially if we can provide battles to fight and plenty of goodies for his hoard. Nopony can deny the morale boost a dragon provides!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"
