CTH_MZO_eye_of_the_storm:0 "In the Eye of the Storm"
CTH_MZO_eye_of_the_storm_desc:0 "In the eye of a hurricane there is quiet, for just a moment, we can think without clouds. War is upon us, and it is time to make preperations."

CTH_MZO_fortify_the_east:0 "Fortify the East"
CTH_MZO_fortify_the_east_desc:0 "The Star Father cannot be allowed to decimate the citizens of Zur, we will hold onto the region with everything we have and defeat him with our full might. To do this, we must foritfy our border with Gerza in the east so Colthage is not threatened."

CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank:0 "Reinforce the Bagraza's Bank"
CTH_MZO_hold_the_bagrazas_bank_desc:0 "The Eastern bank of the Bagraza is an amazing defensive position that we cannot sacrifice by trying to hold onto Zur. We shall holt this position while we wear down and defeat Gerza's forces, then we shall turn and destroy the Star Father and his cult."

CTH_MZO_mobilise_zur:0 "Mobilize Zur"
CTH_MZO_mobilise_zur_desc:0 "Zur is not a state of military industry, but what we need now is guns and bullets, not fish and civilian goods. The industry in the state shall be converted to suit the needs of its own defense."

CTH_MZO_not_one_step_back:0 "Not One Step Back"
CTH_MZO_not_one_step_back_desc:0 "Zur and Colthage must not fall! We shall not retreat in the face of horror! We shall never falter in the face of these apocalyptic odds! Hold your ground!"

CTH_MZO_second_plan_of_zapsa_desc:0 ""

CTH_MZO_at_all_cost:0 "At All Cost"
CTH_MZO_at_all_cost_desc:0 "Colthage must produce everything we will need for our war against Gerza, so we need to get the economy into fighting shape. All production is needed for the state and shall become property of the army, every factory producing weapons shall be driven into overdrive to supply the push west."

CTH_MZO_colthage_must_survive:0 "Colthage Must Survive"
CTH_MZO_colthage_must_survive_desc:0 "The beating heart of our antion must never fall to the rebels. That is why every citizen of our brave city must be ready to give everything for the fight. All for Colthage, for Colthage provides all."

CTH_MZO_choke_the_traitors_desc:0 ""

CTH_MZO_declare_martial_law:0 "Declare Martial Law"
CTH_MZO_declare_martial_law_desc:0 "To protect the people, one must make grave sacrificies. The days of Martial Law must return, the suspension of civil liberties to ensure the survival of the state is needed, and the entire country must be placed at the whim of the army if we are to continue to survive. Hopefully, the people shall forgive us one day."

CTH_MZO_first_servants_of_the_state:0 "The First Servants of the State"
CTH_MZO_first_servants_of_the_state_desc:0 "We are not alone in our fight against corruption and chaos, there are freedom loving creatures all accross the world, but mainly Kasa, who are willing to turn out and fight for democracy. They may be few in number, but we thank them all the same."

CTH_MZO_from_the_shadows:0 "From the Shadows"
CTH_MZO_from_the_shadows_desc:0 "We've made contact with resistance elements against the Star Father's rule in the Zapsa region. As the dictator moves his armies closer to Colthage we can assist these elements in making strikes on crucial rail lines that would supply the Covenant's frontlines."

CTH_MZO_colthage_greatest_legacy:0 "Colthage's Greatest Legacy..."
CTH_MZO_colthage_greatest_legacy_desc:0 "Our navy is our greatest ally in this fight against Tyranny. With many ships docked in the capital at the outbreak of the civil war, Zaphod has been hard at work trying to wrangle the navy in any way she can to further supply and assist our cause. We better be thankful, because without them we wouldn't survive for long."

CTH_MZO_cut_the_arteries:0 "Cut the Arteries"
CTH_MZO_cut_the_arteries_desc:0 "The rail line running from the Covenant capital in Hippone to Zur will likely be the Star Father's main line of attack towards the capital. If our navy can shell and destroy the railway we can hopefully deprive the Star Father of supplies for his army, lifting some pressure off of our troops."

CTH_MZO_seek_international_support:0 "Seek out International Support"
CTH_MZO_seek_international_support_desc:0 "With our government centered in an urban region and with almost no arable land to our name, we've had to come up with alternative solutions to the ongoing famine. Various charities and foreign nations have offered some food aid to us, and it is up to our navy to bring it all home. While we will likely one day need to pay for all of this, for now it is invaluable to be able to have full stomachs in the city."

CTH_MZO_her_last_friends:0 "...And Her Last Friends"
CTH_MZO_her_last_friends_desc:0 "With the Star Father's professional army and Gerza's mercenaries bearing down on us, we don't just need more and better troops. We need officers to lead them. We've tracked down a few of Colthage's old generals, and it's time to put the nation's last friends to work protecting her."

CTH_MZO_cash_win_wars:0 "The Lifeblood of Warring Nations"
CTH_MZO_cash_win_wars_desc:0 "Weapons and money, we need them both, and we need them badly. No nation can wage war without both, and we are chronically short. The Zarishatian regime had all its reserves stolen and its weapons scattered in rebel territory fighting the same scourges we now battle against. It is a regrettable thing, but we must now beg the people for donations."

CTH_MZO_race_to_trotkat:0 "The Race to Trotkat"
CTH_MZO_race_to_trotkat_desc:0 "The road to trotkat is not open, but it is flat! Monzano has experimented with importing old cars and armored vehicles from Griffonia to form new companies that might be the key to winning our war in the East."

CTH_MZO_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
CTH_MZO_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The old Zarishatian air force project still has its home in the city of Colthage. Monzano helped the government pioneer it, and so she knows where all the equipment and aircraft is stored. It's time to uncover these planes and put them to work against our enemies."

CTH_MZO_death_from_above:0 "Death From Above"
CTH_MZO_death_from_above_desc:0 "Loading our soldiers into planes and dropping them on enemy positions in the east may sound like a risky idea, but it's risks we need right now to win back our nation."

CTH_MZO_zels_righteous_warriors:0 "Za'al's Righteous Servants"
CTH_MZO_zels_righteous_warriors_desc:0 "The clergy haven't been all that influential in Colthage in recent years, but in these times of complete chaos where each soldier fights for his survival against vicious enemies, some words of encouragement from the priests may be just what we need."

CTH_MZO_a_new_republic:0 "A New Republic"
CTH_MZO_a_new_republic_desc:0 "Colthage has been through a lot of governments in recent years. The Zarcid regime was... middling, the Constitutionalists betrayed the people, and the Zarishat regime brought out the worst in all of us. So where does the nation look to now for inspiration to fight on? Monzano believes there must be a new Republic, a new ideal to strive for, free of the chains of these past failures. A new future for all."

CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope:0 "A Leader is a Dealer in Hope"
CTH_MZO_a_leader_is_a_dealer_in_hope_desc:0 "A leader must give their people something to believe in, an idea to strive towards. The Star Father gave them ideas of race and an apocalyptic destiny, Gerza gave them normality and prosperity. What can Monzano offer?\n\nPerhaps, a new kind of hope."
