  kir_hierarchy_level_3_title: "Mystic Militarch"
  kir_hierarchy_level_4_title: "Mystic Literarch"
  kir_hierarchy_level_5_title: "Mystic Burearch"
  kir_hierarchy_level_1_title_desc: "The Watch, The Jurist, The Refined One of the Most Sacrosanct: such are few of the roles and titles bestowed upon The First Priestess.\n\nAs the de jure head of the Way of Fire, the First Priestess is the chief discoverer and recorder of the will of Concord (second only to the Matriarch Superior herself in this position) and how to apply it into one's life. In this capacity, she is the mediator between the other-worldly and this present realm, with supreme jurisdiction over the Way as manifested in this world.\n\nSuch mediation is not an easy task. She is to answer to the spiritual needs and issues of millions of kirin, who these days are constantly led astray by the wiles of the nations outside and the infidels inside. Constantly exhorting to every kirin she meets the necessity of adhering to the Five Tenets—in professional meetings, in elaborate ceremonies, in casual trips across the Realm—her duty of caring souls never ends."
  kir_hierarchy_level_2_title_desc: "While the First Priestess oversees the sacred, the Priestesses Seneschal oversee the secular: the finances of the Hierocracy as a whole, accountability among the Mystics Militarch, and deciding which junior priestesses and mystics to elevate or to shift. They report directly to the First Priestess and are often her most direct advisors on spiritual matters as those.\n\nTraditionally, the Priestesses Seneschal had come in twos, no more and no less, handling one half of Kiria each regarding its spiritual health, though those halves have shifted over the centuries depending on where the Priestesses come from. They were almost always present in ceremonies that invoke the the First Priestess's presence. In addition, they are not solely Priestesses Seneschals, for they took on parts of their prior duties (so, in theory, a Kirian polity can have two presiding priestesses, with one selected to "replace" the leaving now-Seneschal incumbent, the latter being occasionally asked to mentor the former)."
  kir_hierarchy_level_3_title_desc: "As the Valiants' existence shows, the Way of Fire has always been familiar with the ways of war, the helpfulness of which was demonstrated so painfully in the civil war just past. For all the grit and glory our hoofsoldiers endured and deserved, our victory would not have been possible without the critical skills the Mystics Militarch offered.\n\nSynthesising the tenets of the Way with the necessities of warfare, the Militarchs superintend the organisation and the strategical thinking of Kiria's thousand banners, an obligation pertinent in light of modern developments such as tanks, missiles, and aircraft. They can be seen in meetings as secluded as war rooms hidden within the Peaks of Peril or the western jungles, or in occasions as open as teaching in a military academy or convincing young adults to enlist in a new banner. Their work in peace is as strenuous as in war, adding to their responsibilities the configuring of Kiria's police force and other law enforcement establishments.\n\nBy blades of steel and wit, the Militarchs shall forever defend, in Kiria, the Way and the Matriarch."
  kir_hierarchy_level_4_title_desc: "The foundation of their faith is a veritable mountain of ancient scrolls, verified supernatural events, and thorough apologetics, lived out by their constant observance of spiritual rituals and ceremonies that pull them closer to Concord than most: upon these live the Mystics Literarch.\n\nA Literarch's main duty is to oversee the body of religion that is The Way of Fire, possessing the final say on the interpretation of tenets and the sustentation of age-old Way practices. Extreme disputes between mystics on spiritual matters are also resolved by the Literarchs on the basis that any judgment they will make is as good as divine revelation. In addition, the Literarchs are the public face of the Way on the world religion stage, providing proofs and arguments to  prove the Way's transcendence as well as organising proselytisation efforts in notorious hotbeds of heresy should the need arise. But the Way of Fire is also a science and a philosophy, and the Literarchs reflect this in their supervision of science institutions Kiria-wide, emphasising what inner truths about Concord and Her will can be revealed that can fill the existing gaps in our knowledge. Par the course (as they are Mystics), one final duty they have to Kiria is cleansing the land clean from heresy, blessing kirinity with specialised regiments to flush out unorthodoxy and to extinguish the inner flames of those who twist Concord's words.\n\nKiria may be run by bureaucrats and protected by generals, but it's the Mystics Literarch who make sure that, no matter the era, Kiria is still Kiria."
  kir_hierarchy_level_5_title_desc: "It is said that to be a Burearch is to be a mediator of every facet of the world. It is also said to be a thankless job, for the public is often smitten by the popular picture of praying temple priests or proud warrior-monks and strategists, and anykirin with more than a passing intent to become one must study for and pass a punishing civil service examination just to work under a Burearch.\n\nBut ask a Burearch about the above, and no matter their roles or responsibilities and the lack of limelight they can bask in, they will reply that the other Mystics constantly thank them: not every priest can handle the rigours of signing seals and memorizing the minuitaie of sanctuary maintenance codes; not every martial can pore through every letter and transaction that passes through the hooves of entire desmesnes.\n\nThough the Burearchs squirrel away in government offices and the backrooms of lesser temples, handling administrative duties or rote rituals, these Mystics are the sages that keep the wheels of Kiria running."
