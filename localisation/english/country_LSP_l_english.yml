 LSP_ball_and_chain_desc:0 "A bygone relic of the pre-independence administration, nopony is quite sure how exactly Ball and Chain ended up in function. Perhaps, at one point, he indeed was a productive member of the cabinet that deserved his position as a political advisor. Whatever his history may be, however, it's become very clear in recent times that he is drastically unfit for his role in Las Pegasusian politics. The only thing still keeping him in his office chair is the sheer bureaucratic backlog the new state must comb through before they can even hope to find the time to kick him out. Until the infernal stacks of paperwork are sorted, or the incompetent pony finds himself killed somehow, Ball and Chain is free to keep dropping coffee over important documents, picking his nostrils at inappropriate times, burp during interviews, make snide, unfunny remarks to his coworkers and drag the country down further into the dirt as he pleases."

 rokenhardesc:0 "Rokenhar had always been a competent civil servant, perfectly content with the repetitive, paper-pushing routine of his daily duties. He had risen to the position of Mayor of Las Pegasus, a position that, until recently, required very few actual skills beyond being able to make the occasional public speech. The large corporations that made up the real political power of Las Pegasus took care of practically all of the actual work.\n\nUnfortunately for Rokenhar, said fat cat business interests that ruled Las Pegasus from the shadows reacted with irrational and short-sighted alarm to the Civil War. Fearing that their assets would be seized and nationalised for the war effort, or that the newly-created bureaucracy would expose the mountains of corruption that they stood upon, they more or less forced Rokenhar to declare independence from Equestria.\n\nNow, surrounded by enemies within and without on every side, this tired old stallion just doesn't know what to do. How is he supposed to deal with this?"
 rokenhardesc2:0 "Nopony would have thought it possible, but Rokenhar has finally done it. Whether he had always been a political genius underneath, or whether he was merely a public face supported by a legion of more competent advisors, none can deny that Rokenhar has crushed all of his opponents and become the undisputed ruler of Las Pegasus."
 splowdesc:0 "Starry Plough has spent years struggling to protect and organise the working ponies of Las Pegasus from the rapacious capitalists that have always ruled it, with moderate success. The Princesses, monarchs though they were, at least made some efforts to help the workers, but with the secession of Las Pegasus all such efforts ceased, and now the workers have finally broken free from their bread and circuses. Finally, they hold destiny within their own hooves, and Starry Plough will guide and protect them on their journey." 
 SugarSprinkleDesc:0 "Though Starry Plough is the most famous face of the socialist movement in Las Pegasus, his efforts would have amounted to little more than sound and fury had it not been for the grassroots networks of labor unions that were built up around him. Though Sugar Sprinkle was never as charismatic as Starry Plough, she was no less zealous in the cause of the workers, but she saw that trying to rebuild society from scratch was a foolish endeavor - trying to build something whose shape you don't even know is a recipe for failure. Instead, she advocated a reformed kind of democracy that could maximise the freedom and comfort of all. Now that the Congress has elected her as leader, her moderate policies will prevail, turning Las Pegasus into a shining island of prosperity in the sea of chaos around it."
 pcadesc:0 "Pine Chest has always been something of an eccentric sort. Born in Las Pegasus, his family moved around the world constantly, from Severyana to Bales to Manehattan, even spending time in Aquileia and Wingbardy across the ocean. It was during this tumultuous youth that he came into contact with the socialist movement as well as Beakolini's fascists. One day, his father's office was firebombed by a Wingbardian communist terrorist, leaving a permanent scar on the stallion's heart.\n\nReturning home to Las Pegasus, Pine Chest became famous for getting into fights with trade unionists by the docksides, even gathering a group of like-minded followers to help him "break up the dens of treason", as he put it. At this time he had a fervent zeal for the diarchy, but when Celestia refused to go to war to prevent the secession of Stalliongrad, he had a crisis of faith, concluding that Celestia must be a crypto-communist herself.\n\nNow firmly in control of the city, Pine Chest refuses to allow Communists and Communist sympathisers to destroy his homeland the way they did his father."
 rockfellerDescLSP:0 "A powerful business magnate from the South States, Rockfeller made his fortune from oil money as a young stallion, and established a wide network of patronage and clients throughout the whole south. His company, General Petroleum, is the primary supplier of crude oil and oil-based products to Las Pegasus, and his vast wealth has bought him massive influence in the workings of the city. Now that Pine Chest has been "persuaded" to appoint him as the new Mayor, he looks forward to expanding his influence even further. Nopony will stand in the way of this self-made stallion!"
 horseDesc:0 "A reclusive and mysterious figure, Trotbert Horse never appears in public, preferring to make statements through mouthpieces and newspapers. Even when he does need to speak in person, he does so through a computer screen, refusing ever to show even the possibility of a hint of weakness. Chairpony and founder of the prestigious HorseCo. computer, machine tools, and radio company, as well as the owner of a chain of successful casinos, most would not have though of Horse as a capable leader. And yet, here he is, chosen to lead the city in its hour of darkness. Behind his screen, he grins slightly. Everything is proceeding exactly as planned."
 squildesc:0 "An unassuming advisor for most of her life, Sugarquill came into the confidence of Mayor Rokenhar after she played a key role in ensuring that the city survived the radical forces that sought to destroy it. Indeed, many suspected that she was the true genius behind the near-miraculous salvation of the City. Now that the venerable Mayor has passed from this world, Sugarquill rules the city that she helped to save. No matter what happens, she will not allow all that they fought so hard for to die."
 LSP_sharps_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of March, 968 in Ponydena\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to an earth pony family in Ponydena, Sharp Shot gained a love for all things boat-shaped when his family went on an outing to the San Prancisco bay when he was 10 years old. Eventually, he joined the Royal Navy and toured the seas as a junior officer and retiring at the rank of Captain. His curious and unorthodox nature got him into as much trouble as it got him out of. Afterwards, still yearning for the seas, he took up a ranking position in the Las Pegasus Harbor Patrol. When Las Pegasus declared independence it wasn't hard to find somepony to defend her coasts. He believes that trade is the lifeblood of a nation, a belief that rings especially true in Las Pegasus.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
 LSP_cherry_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 978 in Hayderson\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hayderson, a suburb of Las Pegasus, Cherry Soda is the middle of three siblings, although her brother would be keen to point out that she's only a few minutes older than him. From a young age, Cherry took an interest in all things related to flying, be it pulp tales of ponies flying to distant worlds or eagerly following the development of airplanes. Other than that, her life was notable only for how absolutely normal it was, in every sense of the term, she was a model Equestrian pony. She likely would have continued to lead an unremarkable life were it not for the rapid destabilization of her homeland and the declaration of independence issued by Las Pegasus' mayor. Although not a military mare by trade, she joined up with the newly formed Las Pegasus army, either at the request of her brother, or of her own desire to support him. Regardless of why she joined, it quickly became apparent that she had a knack for coordinating joint land and air operations, with a solid understanding of the ins and outs of both army and airforce bureaucracy.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
 LSP_blueberry_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 978 in Hayderson\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hayderson, a suburb of Las Pegasus, Blueberry Soda is the youngest of three siblings, a fact that never sat too well with him, especially with his twin sister Cherry acting like she was the more mature one, despite being only a few minutes older. Always striving to get out of the shadow of his older sisters, Blueberry grew to have a fierce independence streak, which quickly morphed into what most ponies would call arrogance and "being a downright jackass", although he always spun it as his overwhelming self-confidence. This desire to be more independent from his family led him to join the Las Pegasus guard at 17, rising through the ranks until the outbreak of the Equestrian Civil War, at which point his sister joined up alongside him, ready to face the oncoming storm.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

 ###EVENTS###
 lsp.1.t:0 "The Secession of Las Pegasus"
 lsp.1.d:0 "It's chaos out there. \n\nWe're getting conflicting reports from all over the place. Our entire intelligence network is still reeling from the war, and it takes a good few hours for anything to make it through the jammed radiowaves or cut telegraph wires. At last, the message makes it up the chain of command to Celestia herself, and the news aren't good. \n\nAnother nation has seceded, far away on the western coast - Las Pegasus. This is a nightmare - we've got to do something, but with what troops? With what army? How can we do anything while Nightmare Moon's legions are still carving swathes out of our nation? \n\nThere's nothing to do, not for now at least. We've got to let this new nation be - we have far more pressing issues. Let this new 'Republic of Las Pegasus' rise - it won't last. From our reports, it's apparently even worse there politically than here... Mayor Rokenhar will drag himself to an early grave trying to defend that chaotic speck on the coast. \n\nEither that, or we'll stomp them out of existence once we have less to hold in our hooves."
 lsp.1.a:0 "Curse them!"
 lsp.1.b:0 "Viva Las Pegasus!"
 lsp.3.t:0 "Equestria Annexes Us"
 lsp.3.d:0 ""Then it is settled," Liberty Skye's -- the most adamant of the reunionists -- words echo throughout the cobbled-together parliament hall. "Glad this whole dreadful business is over. The fence will be torn down first thing tomorrow and, with any luck, this entire mess will be forgotten once Equestria gets involved." \n\n Starry Plough grinds his jaw, seething with rage in his seat. Across the room, Pine Chest of the PCA smashes his hoof against the desk and demands the votes be recounted. The pro-monarchists sigh collectively, though ever-politely. And, above all, Mayor Rokenhar looks over the proceedings, as the unionists once again count the votes after Pine Chest's demands, probably for the third time tonight. \n\n "It's settled, as we said. The majority of parliament has agreed to unite with the Kingdom of Equestria, and that's that. No, we will not count again, Pine Chest." Liberty declares finally. \n\n With plenty of sighs and harrumphs, parliament hall slowly empties. Of course, those who failed to seize control now will not give up - the Mayor can see red-dressed communists running into the nearby alleys to plot and scheme, and can hear Pine Chest's ramblings to his ponies about a "righteous coup" even from inside his guarded car. But, on his way to the town hall, he can see something else as well. \n\n Equestrian police officers, already having been permitted on the streets of his city, arresting, policing, reorganizing and undoing all of his efforts for a free Las Pegasus. Rokenhar couldn't think of a way out of this one. Finally, his situation caught up to him - and it was over for good, now."

As shocking as the news were to Equestrian officials, the document, written by Liberty Skye --the leader of a pro-Equestrian faction in their chaotic bureaucracy-- explained that in the wake of free and fair elections, the independent city voted to reunite with us. The border fences will be torn down first thing tomorrow morning and, with any luck, things will return to normal."
 lsp.4.a:0 "That was all rather anticlimactic... well, so long as the troops don't get distracted by the casinos."
 lsp.8.t:0 "Red Rising"
 lsp.8.d:0 ""Command, this is Nomad-1, do you copy?" the police headquarters radio buzzes to life, and the operators scramble to answer. \n\n "We hear you loud and clear, Nomad-1. Did you infiltrate the compound? What have you found?" the head operator asks. \n\n Around an hour ago, a special forces group broke into one of the many warehouses of the industrial district that the reds turned into an urban stronghold. Many different reports lead them to the location, claiming the communists were using it to stockpile arms for an upcoming attack at a monarchist rally. Granted, these reports came from monarchist spies, so they were dubious at best - therefore, a squadron was sent to reconnaitre the place and bring home more reliable information. \n\n "We infiltrated it and subdued any resistance - only half-asleep, half-drunk guardsponies over here, Command. The reports were right. The shelves are piled up to the ceiling with bombs of all kinds. Pipe-bombs, incendiary cocktails, grenades, rifles, yeesh. Feels like the armoury back at the station over here. We also found attack-plans, aimed straight for New Liberty Boulevard, where the monarchists are rallying tomorrow." the report comes back soon enough. \n\n "Standby, Nomad-1. We're sending word to the mayor, and he'll tell you what to do." the operator informs quickly enough. \n\n "Copy." there's a short confirmation from the other side. \n\n The head operators turns and looks over her shoulder to one of the relay engineers. "Patch me straight through to Mister Rokenhar, secure communications, asap.""
 lsp.8.a:0 "Stop the attack and take credit for it personally."
 lsp.8.b:0 "Allow the attack to take place, it's against our political enemies."
 lsp.9.t:0 "Factory Owner Goes on Trial!"
 lsp.9.d:0 "A few days ago, there was uproar in the papers (granted, there's a new uproar in the papers pretty much every day) in regards to a corrupt factory overseer convicted of multiple crimes... corruption, worker abuse, etcetera etcetera - it was quite the list. It was largely communist papers who reported on the issue, so it was chalked up to mere propaganda for the proletariat. \n\n It was to everyone's surprise when said owner - a wealthy industrialist and also a staunch advocate of Pine Chest - was actually taken before Las Pegasus' court of justice for a fair trial. The stack of evidence the prosecution had was almost enough to break a table under its weight, and the defense could hardly formulate a sentence in the pony's favour. The trial ended quickly, with a searing hot "guilty" verdict from the judge. \n\n However, now the pony must stand before the jury, and as soon as he set hoof out of court, an envelope arrived from his lawyer, full of an extraordinary amount of cash and a promise for even more should he offer... "help". The implication was clear, to say the least. Though Rokenhar's powers are not strong enough to fully influence the jury, the mayor still has strings he can pull and favours he can call in, and with enough lip-service, he can secure that the owner does not end up behind bars, should he be willing to accept the bribe."
 lsp.9.a:0 "Covinct him."
 lsp.9.b:0 "Accept the bribe, it's against our political enemies."
 lsp.16.t:0 "An Assassination Attempt!"
 lsp.16.d:0 "Apparently the PCA is at it again. \nHooray. \n\nA report just made its way to Rokenhar from one of his double-agents - this week, it's an assassination plot. Some facet of their Blackhooves paramilitary thinks they're capable of sneaking an attack on one of the mayor's political advisors. Right as Rokenhar was about to inform Chief Whitehorn at the Police Department about it, though, he read who exactly was on the hit-list. \n\nBall-and-Chain. Really? That slob of a pony that sleeps half the time and picks his nostril the other half? He didn't even hear the news about his upcoming assassination - he was busy snoozing. \n\nWhy would the PCA want him - HIM, of all ponies - dead? If anything... it'd be a good thing for the government. One less slob cluttering the workplace, spilling coffee on important paperwork and ruining Rokenhar's reputation."
 lsp.16.a:0 "Notify Whitehorn and save this idiot's life."
 lsp.16.b:0 "Let's just... pretend nopony saw that. And tell Sugarquill to start looking for a new advisor."
 lsp.17.t:0 "Trade Unionists In Sightlines"
 lsp.17.d:0 "Whitehorn's ponies have been busy lately with tracking down one of the many syndicates -- the criminal kind, not Starry Plough's "power to the workers!" kind -- of the city. After a few days worth of crawling through gutters, piecing together nuggets of information and trying to win the trust of the mob, our chief of police has managed to figure out what exactly this particular organization's motives are. \n\nMultiple intercepted couriers and letters indicate that they've been paid to assassinate someone. But said someone is none other than Hammerblow Watchmaker - the posterboy for one of the largest trade unions that isn't under Starry Plough's hoof yet. \n\nWhitehorn's been itching to raid their headquarters and put a stop to them - and their assassination plans - once and for all, but maybe, just maybe, letting them go through with their plans could prove to be useful to us by kneecapping the reds."
 lsp.17.a:0 "Let Whitehorn intervene."
 lsp.17.b:0 "Let the assassination proceed."
 lsp.18.t:0 "Another Brick"
 lsp.18.d:0 "Another window we have to repair. Can't these ponies think of anything better to do than to throw bricks at the town hall? Surely there's other ways they could protest - this all getting rather out of control, really. \n\nThe Metropolitan Police is trying its best, but it's spread way too thin. Protests and riots were indeed expected and planned for, but nobody thought they'd be so... huge. They really hate us, don't they? \n\nThe riot police doesn't have the numbers nor equipment to properly put down all of the protests that have arose across the city lately. \n\nThe harmonists are back at it with the same-old same-old cries for reunification with Equestria, and have occupied (and blocked) large swathes of the Big Boulevard and of Sentinel Plaza. Meanwhile, a whole mish-mash of radicals have formed a loose ceasefire to protest together, ranging from PCA industrialists demanding the fall of the "fake state" (whatever that means) to communist workers laying down their tools to go on strike. \n\nIf we want to be even slightly efficient, we'll have to focus on one group in particular. So, where do we tell Whitehorn's ponies to strike?"
 lsp.18.a:0 "Dismantle the harmonists' blockades."
 lsp.18.b:0 "Put the radicals back in line!"
 lsp.19.t:0 "A Mole"
 lsp.19.d:0 "Sugarquill - the mayoral secretary - just burst in with some pretty concerning news. An entire stack of sensitive documents has gone missing overnight from the government archive and ended up in the claws of PCA. Nobody quite knows how it's happened, and even though there's been plenty of hoof-pointing, Whitehorn claims there's no way to figure out exactly who the traitor amongst us. \nGreat. Simply fantastic. \n\nThe most we can do now is damage-control. Through double-agents and other contacts we have in the PCA ranks, we can make sure that another FAKE stack of sensitive documents makes it to the PCA elites to mislead them and hopefully cover our tracks."
 lsp.19.a:0 "Send the fake papers."
 lsp.19.b:0 "Let's just hope they... ignore it, eh?"
 lsp.20.t:0 "Yet Another Problem In the Streets"
 lsp.20.d:0 "So there's yet another situation that needs solving on the Big Boulevard. When isn't there? \n\nToday was the day the city's trade unions were supposed to rally and march in front of the city hall to let their de-facto leader, Starry Plough, deliver his big speech addressed to all of the 'mistreated' and 'oppressed' proletariat from across the city and the new nation. Par for the course for the Communists - but as is often the case, their operation didn't quite go as planned. \n\nAs workers on strike marched down the boulevard with red banners towards their position in front of town hall, they came across a celestial congregation around their podium. A Royalist rally had gathered in a counter-protest, and they don't seem too eager to let the firebrand of the revolution give his speech. \n\nFor now, things haven't gotten too bloody - a few slurs hurled towards each other and only a hoofful of fights. Secretary Sugarquill suggests just standing back and letting them pacify each other, but given Starry Plough's reputation as a troublemaker, we shouldn't let the situation reach a boiling point. Whitehorn insists we do something about it."
 lsp.20.a:0 "Disperse the Royalists and let Starry Plough speak."
 lsp.20.b:0 "Turn the Communists away and let the Royalists get today's victory."
 lsp.21.t:0 "Questionable Arrests"
 lsp.21.d:0 "Whitehorn is, to say the least, absolutely furious. He's been pacing and steaming up and down the town hall ever since the news arrived from one of our double-agents rooted in the PCA. \n\nPine Chest has apparently grown a little too big for his boots, and already thinks the Patriotic Citizen Army has the legislative power to perform arrests without needing permission from either Mayor Rokenhar or from Whitehorn at the Metropolitan Police Department. \n\nHowever, the agent also brought back a list of the persons on the PCA hit-list, and it contains a staggering amount of supporters from both the Communists and the Royalists. Nobody too high up in their hierarchies, of course, for fear of counter-attacks, but telling Whitehorn to swallow his pride and let the arrests go ahead could put some pretty hefty dents in both the trade unionists' and the anti-independence campaigners' ranks."
 lsp.21.a:0 "Tell Whitehorn to look the other way and let them go ahead."
 lsp.21.b:0 "Let Whitehorn lay down the law and stop them."
 lsp.22.t:0 "Dustytome Spits Fire On the Nationalists"
 lsp.22.d:0 "Prominent political philosopher and intellectual Paige Turner has just authored her latest work - 'The Connection Between Celestia and Stalliongrad', in which she debunks Pine Chest's conspiracy about the monarchist-communist connection with all of the striking, cold efficiency of an expert autopsy. \n\nThis, unsurprisingly, has the PCA in a complete storm over it. Pine Chest has already publically denounced the book as 'a work of slander with no basis in reality', angry and emboldened nationalists have already started to vandalize and loot bookstores selling the controversial work, and one of the core elements of the PCA's ideology is starting to teeter under academic scrutiny. \n\nPaige herself informed us that she's not at all afraid for her life, and would in fact like to give a public interview in regards to the book, televised for the city to see and played across all radios in Las Pegasus. Both Whitehorn and Sugarquill are concerned for her safety."
 lsp.22.a:0 "Let her have her interview."
 lsp.22.b:0 "Perhaps we should stop her."
 lsp.23.t:0 "Bloodied Dirt"
 lsp.23.d:0 "With the growing power of Starry Plough's trade unions, more and more industrialists are finding themselves taken to the court of law by the day, sued for their various misdeeds against the workers of the city. \n\nMost of the time, Mayor Rokenhar and his cabinet is content to simply watch from afar, often laughing at the poor stallions caught off-guard, their defense struggling to speak against a prosecution with a stack of evidence tall enough to reach the ceiling. \n\nBut, occasionally, desperate industrialists seek help from the town hall itself. Often times they're ignored... but this is an opportunity too juicy to not at least consider. \nOliver Clethermont, CEO of the renowned Clethermont Trade Company, approached us with a sealed document, containing a list longer than the current draft of the constitution - he promises it's a comprehensive list of all of the 'dirt' he's accumulated on the Harmonists and Anti-Independence protestors since the secession of Las Pegasus. But, in return for the document, he expects a full mayoral pardon for his crimes. \n\nMayor Rokenhar, though he doesn't have absolute power in the court room, does have the connections, strings to pull and favours to call to lower Clethermont's sentence from a life under arrest to the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. One just has to wonder if all of that less-than-legal string-pulling is worth this list of spicy gossip."
 lsp.23.a:0 "Take the list and let him walk free."
 lsp.23.b:0 "Reject the offer and let him face justice."
 lsp.24.t:0 "Military Parade Goes Sour"
 lsp.24.d:0 "Las Pegasus can't pride itself on much, in our current state - our industry still needs to be recalibrated for independence, our food situation is precarious at best, our government is still in a state of permanent chaos... but our military! Oh, our military...! \n\n...Is not something too spectacular either, right now. But, hey, confidence is the ability to take pride in one's accomplishments, no matter how small, eh? That, and Whitehorn has been begging us to let him have a military parade for the past few days. At last, we gave him the go-ahead, and with childish glee he made sure every uniform was ironed, every gun lacquered and every button polished, before setting out with his ponies on Las Pegasus' first military parade since independence. \n\nThey made it all of about five steps before trouble arose. While the citizens did crowd up to see their soldiers, to see that Las Pegasus is not on its last legs, the Royalists were unsurprisingly less-than-enthusiastic to witness the parade. After all, to them, these weren't soldiers of Las Pegasus - these were rogue soldiers of Equestria. \n\nSo, Whitehorn's parade now faces an early end, considering the fact that there's now a protesting crowd of ponies half the size of his army blocking his planned route. We could either give the Royalists the win today, and tell him to take his soldiers back to their barracks... or, we could tell him to disperse the crowd. They're the ones that have the rifles, after all."
 lsp.24.a:0 "Dismantle the parade and tell Whitehorn to go home."
 lsp.24.b:0 "Forcefully dissipate the crowd with a few warning-shots."
 lsp.25.t:0 "A Targeted Strike"
 lsp.25.d:0 "For the first time in a long time, the mayor's to-do list is all but empty. Whitehorn's ponies spend their days training at the station. Sugarquill makes herself busy by reading books at the reception desk. Workponies repair the broken windows of the town hall. The headlines in the papers are fairly mild, by the city's standards. It's a slow week today, isn't it? \n\nSuch an opportunity is a rare one, nowadays. Usually, the mayor's ponies are forced to react to whatever new crisis arises, but now they have the ability to be the ones calling the shots, for once. Whitehorn has an entire list of communist radicals he's been meaning to arrest, whereas Sugarquill is confident we should pursue knocking out the anti-independence campaigners as our prime objective. Both of them bring up valid issues, but judging by the political climate, this opportunity to act won't last long - the Mayor will have to decide which of them to give the go-ahead to."
 lsp.25.a:0 "Sugarquill - break apart the latest royalist protest blocking traffic on the Boulevard."
 lsp.25.b:0 "Whitehorn - those unionists have been a pain in our side for weeks, sort them out."
 lsp.26.t:0 "A Successful Operation!"
 lsp.26.d:0 "Now that's what Mayor Rokenhar calls a good week - a successful police intervention on political dissidents and disturbers of the peace, several cellfuls of rebellious stallions, and another ounce of stability bought to Las Pegasus. But, right as Rokenhar was about to hang up the axe, Sugarquill came with a proposition - giving all credit to the nationalist PCA. \n\nIt may not seem to make much sense, but the scheming secretary insists that it would be the better course of action. After all, the Patriotic Citizen Army is more renowned for their... violent responses to peaceful situations. \n\nAfter all, what's done is done - the movements have ended and Las Pegasus is already stable - giving credit to the PCA would simply keep our hooves clean in the hooves of the people, and turn all critique for the operation to them, instead. \n\nAnd there's no way Pine Chest would refuse an opportunity to boast and puff up his chest."
 lsp.26.a:0 "We'll take full credit, be it praise or critique."
 lsp.26.b:0 "We'll pretend the PCA did it, as they're more effective anyway."
 lsp.27.t:0 "Strikebreaking Backlash"
 lsp.27.d:0 "The strikebreaking law appears to have had quite an opposite effect - rather than lowering the amount of public gatherings, it only seemed to make them grow. Mostly thanks to ponies rising up to protest it. \n\nToday, probably the largest anti-strikebreaking demonstration gathered in one of Las Pegasus' plaza, largely comprised of trade unionists and communist sympathizers, to (very loudly) voice their negative opinions on the law. \n\nTo absolutely nobody's surprise, a royalist counter-rally soon assembled, as always. However, in spite of their equally-negative opinion on strikebreaking, it appears the reds were the bigger evil here. Now, we have what is essentially a polite brawl between the pro-independence campaigners and the trade unionists, the reds trying to protest, and the royalists trying to break up said protest. It's a mess, really, and we have to intervene before blood gets spilt and this descends into even bigger chaos."
 lsp.27.a:0 "Side with the reds and let them protest, dissipating the royalists."
 lsp.27.b:0 "Side with the royalists and break up the red protest."
 lsp.28.t:0 "The PCA, Growing Bolder"
 lsp.28.d:0 "There's been an awful lot of worrying reports lately. Normally, nobody would be surprised hearing news that the PCA has committed yet another atrocity under the name of Pine Chest, but as time goes on, their attacks are growing ever bolder, and ever more ambitious. From individuals, they've begun organizing to attack entire organizations, and multiple of the smaller trade unions alligned with Starry Plough's movement have already been the targets of their attacks. \n\nThere is blood on the line, here. The communists would never admit it, but right now they don't have the capacity to wage counter-attacks on the nationalist militias, and it will only be a matter of time before Pine Chest grows even bolder and begins aiming for the higher-ups in their hierarchy. \n\nWhitehorn is itching to rally his ponies and deliver a proper counter-attack to the PCA, one to leave them reeling and to make sure to put them in their place. But Sugarquill insists that letting the nationalists continue could prevent more communist growth. It's up to Mayor Rokenhar to decide which of his advisors to trust."
 lsp.28.a:0 "Do as Whitehorn says - strike hard, strike fast, leave our mark."
 lsp.28.b:0 "Do as Sugarquill says - let the reds rot, we'll deal with the nationalists later."
 lsp.29.t:0 "Famine Intensifies"
 lsp.29.d:0 "Time to tighten our belts, eh? Oh, dear, oh, dear... \n\nThe granaries in Waffleland are getting emptier rather than fuller. The grocery stores across the city get more barren by the day. Breadmakers have to start substituting flour with horse oats, ash and sawdust, even. Shepherds are completely out of animals after they've all been slaughtered for meat. \nPonies have already begun lining up for their rations. \n\nPine Chest's extravagant meals have been replaced with whatever canned garbage one can find nowadays. Starry Plough's firebrands find themselves too weak with hunger to revolt. The independence movement rages, stronger than ever, demanding to reunite with Equestria if only to get food back. \n\nThe sound of a growling stomach is a tune well-familiar to the atmosphere of Las Pegasus now. We have to fix this."

 lsp.30.t:0 "Las Pegasus Begs For Food"
 lsp.30.d:0 "A diplomat arrived, today. From Las Pegasus, he says. \n\nOne says 'diplomat', but the pony in question hardly looked like he could pass for a valet, or a waiter. His clothes were nice, ironed and well-kept, but his figure was frail and thin - he didn't have much meat on his bones, and that was the topic he wished to the discuss. \n\nThe State of Las Pegasus, after their secession from Equestria during the civil war, has been struggling quite a lot, particularly with the issue of food. Unsurprinsgly, an urban center of that sized can't really survive with that little arable land - so they've come to ask to get on their knees and beg for more food, lest they all starve to death."
 lsp.30.a:0 "We have to help them!"
 lsp.30.b:0 "They've brought this upon themselves."
 lsp.31.t:0 "Food!"
 lsp.31.d:0 "Sacks of grain; crates of warm, ripe peaches and apples; baskets of bread, pastries and cake; a whole container full of eggs, for these trying times; a bucketful of dirt, for some reason. That's a whole lotta food! None of it, sadly, from our harvests however - but from the charity of those nations abroad, kind enough to show us mercy in our period of darkness. Once we've climbed out of this pit of famine, we should find a way to pay them back. \n\n Or not - the food's ours now, anyways. Hooray for charity!"
 lsp.31.a:0 "Hip-Hip-Hoorah!"
 lsp.32.t:0 "A Big Bag Of Nothing"
 lsp.32.d:0 "Well... that was all somewhat expected. It's still disappointing, though. \n\nApparently, a bag of rice, or a sack of grain, or a single sardine was simply too much to ask from our neighbours.

 lsp.33.d:0 "Matters in the nation of Las Pegasus don't seem to be improving. From the looks of it, their food situation grows more and more precarious by the day. Bad harvests, poor food logistics, and a lack of arable land seem to be the main culprits of their current famine. \n\nBut, what it lacks in food, the Republic of Las Pegasus makes up for in industrial power. A large industrial center pre-civil war, their economy has only grown larger and larger, and their leaders appear more than willing to trade some of that production might in turn for some of our food. Shall we trade?"
 lsp.33.a:0 "Accept the offer."
 lsp.33.b:0 "Decline, politely."
 lsp.34.t:0 "Food, Food and Debts!"
 lsp.34.d:0 "Sacks of grain; crates of warm, ripe peaches and apples; baskets of bread, pastries and cake; a whole container full of eggs, for these trying times; a bucketful of dirt, for some reason. And... a giant stack of papers to clutter up the Town Hall, intricately detailing and keeping track of every single gram and kilo of sustenance sent our way, and how much we'll have to pay for it. \n\nAt least we won't starve - but at one point or another, we'll have to pay these debts back."

 lsp.35.t:0 "A Hoof in the Grave"
 lsp.35.d:0 "Mayor Rokenhar has been feeling faint, lately. He's gotten paler, his mane whiter, and in the time ruling Las Pegasus, he's accumulated more and more wrinkles. He and the rest of cabinet simply blamed the lack of sleep, the constant stress of stabilizing this chaotic country, the near-endless supply of coffee he's had to chug on the daily just to stay awake. After all, he was still in the prime of his life, right? He was still a mighty stallion, as far as anyone was concerned. \n\nUntil, one day, he fell. \nNot a simple trip, or a light tumble. One moment, he was talking to Sugarquill and Whitehorn about how to split up the military budgets - the other, he was on the floor, seized up and limp. \n\nIt didn't take long to take him to a doctor, and thankfully he was stabilized soon enough. But it was clear this won't be just an isolated incident. Something was wrong with Mayor Rokenhar, and whatever it is, it's been eating away at him for years, unseen and deadly, only growing stronger under the stress and tiredness of rule. \n\nA week later, the doctors' diagnosis arrived in the mail.

 lsp.107.d:0 ""You're not a young stallion anymore, Rokenhar. Don't even try to argue about that." Sugarquill's sweet voice rings in the mayor's chambers. He doesn't reply, and heaves out a heavy sigh as he slowly drags himself out of bed, leaning on her for support.\n\n Sugarquill didn't use to be too high-up in the hierarchy of the city's bureaucracy. She was just another mayoral advisor working under Rokenhar, making sure that everypony was well behind the scenes. Nowadays, with the mayor hardly able to walk the distance from his chambers to his office, she's become the most important pony for him. Everything he can't do anymore, she does for him.\n\n"I presume I've struck a nerve, judging from your look." She states, dryly looking at him as she helps him down the hall.\n\n"You don't say." A curt response. Rokenhar scoffs, sadly. "What's that supposed to tell me? I know I'm just a shrivelled up old sack of a pony - I see that every time I look in the mirror."\n\n"Please, sir. Now you're just looking for things to be angry about. That's not what I meant at all, and you know that very well." Sugarquill fires back, shooting him a scolding look. Rokenhar groans out another sigh.\n\n "Yes. I'm sorry," he answers with a shake of his head, walking into his office with her. The mayor lays down in his comfy chair, doing all the stretching his stiff muscles can afford, as she pulls the blinds, flooding the room with golden morning light. The mayor half-closes his eyes from the sudden brightness. "It was that whole heir business you've been going on about."\n\n"At last. I finally got through to you." Sugarquill smiles, looking at him from over his desk. "So? Have you made up your mind about it? Can I start looking?"\n\n"You're really eager for me to die, huh?" Rokenhar quirks an eyebrow, and Sugarquill opens her mouth to reply, but he cuts her off quickly enough with a hoarse laugh. "Yes, yes, I was joking, relax. I know you're just... looking after an old stallion."\n\n "So, then... you agree. We should start looking.""

 lsp.108.d:0 ""We've been doing this for the better part of the day, Mr. Mayor—" Sugarquill struggles to maintain composure as Rokenhar looks over some of the candidates on one of the many lists she's compiled.\n\n"Next," the mayor says dryly. A sort of pattern formed after the first few proposals - Sugarquill would try to give them a short summary, Rokenhar would interrupt her and ask to see the paper himself, then he'd ask for the next one. Rinse and repeat for roughly six hours now.\n\n"Mr. Mayor, please..." Sugarquill groans, rubbing her forehead with her hoof. "You can't be serious—"\n\n"I said next." Rokenhar insists, leaning back in his chair, rubbing the back of his aching neck.\n\nWith a sigh, Sugarquill picks up the next candidate. "Alegio Morrel, a hard-working industrialist with a—"\n\n"Next." Rokenhar insists.\n\n"Look, see! There it is! You didn't even let me finish, Mr. Mayor-- are you sure you even want an heir at all? You could've simply said "no", rather than making me go through all this just for the sake of being polite." Sugarquill rolls her eyes in frustration, crumpling up the paper and tossing it over her shoulder.\n\n"I'm sorry, Ms. Quill," Rokenhar begins with a sigh. "But none of these candidates speak to me. I can't pick someone I don't like - they have to resonate with me."\n\n"Are we ever going to find someone that resonates with you, Mr. Mayor?" Sugarquill asks, tilting her head and groaning. They've been at this for hours.\n\n"Maybe you should let me look myself. That way I'll find someone I like." Rokenhar replies, with a soft smile. She shrugs, not knowing what else to do.\n\nThe minutes begin to drag on, as the mayor places his elbows on his desk and his hooves under his chin, deep in thought. Sugarquill picks out her own chair, sitting down and waiting on him to finish. At last, he speaks.\n\n"Tell me, Ms. Quill - what sounds better? Mayor, governor, or president? After all... we're more than just a city now." Rokenhar asks, giving her a sly look from across the table. The pony doesn't particularly understand the question at first, tilting her head in confusion. "Just answer."\n\n"I presume... president, Mr. Mayor. No offense, but as you said - we're not just a city anymore." She nods.\n\n "Aha, I see, I see..." Rokenhar nods back, tapping his chin. "Tell me...""

 lsp.109.t:0 ""I Know a Pony, Who Knows a Pony...""
 lsp.109.d:0 ""This is insane, Mr. Mayor. You can't be serious about me, I'm not qualified at all to—" Sugarquill insists, sitting in the meeting hall next to Rokenhar, all suited and made-up, as if she was ready for guests.\n\n"Oh, nonsense, I tell you." The mayor rolls his eyes with a low chuckle. "You're the most qualified person for the job, I assure you. Look me in the eyes and tell me I've made a mistake in picking you," he tells her, and Sugarquill quickly looks at him, opening her mouth to reply, but not having the time to. "Exactly," Rokenhar cuts her off before she can even say anything. "I never make mistakes."\n\n"You've made plenty of mistakes..." Sugarquill grumbles, glaring at the floor in the defeat.\n\n"Well, you were there to fix them before they could do any harm, so that just gives me all the more reason to have faith in you." Rokenhar smiles over her, which only prompts the now heir to groan in annoyance again. "Sugarquill, seriously now, this is getting dull. You're the best Las Pegasus could ask for - vigilant, loyal, determined... it's everything we need for an heir."\n\n"There's plenty of other ponies around who meet the same qualifications—" Sugarquill once again is interrupted.\n\n"I'm getting sick of this, Ms. Quill. Tell me for real now, do you, or do you not want to become the new mayor?" Rokenhar finally glares down at her, giving her an ultimatum. "It's not funny anymore, all of this self-deprecating business."\n\nThere's a short silence. Sugarquill looks down at the ground, slightly embarrassed. "You have this... terrible tendency to interrupt people." She says, under her breath. Rokenhar, however, only smiles.\n\n"So, President Sugarquill it is." He nods, victoriously.\n\n"Well, it's all great that you agree to it, but how are we going to convince anypony else?" Sugarquill looks up at him, worried. At that moment, the door to the chamber opens, and a dozen different pony politicians clad in all assortments of fancy suits and ties begin to step inside, chatting and laughing, making their way for a table at the centre of the room.\n\n"Don't worry about it. This is where you let the old stallion handle things." Rokenhar smirks. He knew everypony there, each and every single pony. And, more importantly, he knew they all owed him something - and he won't be asking for much. Only a single vote."

 lsp.110.t:0 "Reminiscence"
 lsp.110.d:0 "On days like these, the water, the clouds, the skies, seem darker. His bones seem to rattle like dry twigs, and his legs seem like they can hardly hold him up anymore. Oh, how fast the clock of time ticks. How fast it turns from day to midnight, if you're not careful.\n\n"Aagh..." Rokenhar groans through gritted teeth as he takes a seat on the base of one of the stone statues in the city hall's courtyard. Then, he sighs in relief, the heavy weight taken off his legs. It was hard to pinpoint where it all went so wrong, so suddenly. How one day he could tackle any legislature or national decree... and the other, he could hardly get out of bed.\n\nBut there is pain, here, beyond physical. Beyond the ache in his back, the burn beneath his forehead, the tingle in his stiff muscles, something hurt within. And the still water of the pond in the courtyard, bobbing with cattails and lily pads, only fed that pain more and more.\n\nOn days like these, he wondered how Sapphire was doing. It's been so long since he's seen her, his wife. Since he's hugged her tight to his chest and said all would be okay. Since he could whisper his worries in her ear and she could make him forget all about them. Since he could see her smile, and the sight of it alone could brighten up his day more than any news of good harvests or increased factory efficiency ever could.\n\nAnd every time he remembered Sapphire, he remembered Cello as well. And now, though the birds were singing around him, he heard no chirping. He heard Cello, playing the violin in the living room, as Sapphire and he were listening on their armchairs.\n\nIt's been so long... It felt like eternity. Yet it still feels like yesterday.\n\nSuddenly, the searing pain in his legs returns, and it's only now he realises that he's standing up, walking back towards the building without even realising it, groaning and mumbling."
 lsp.110.a:0 ""I must see them again. I can't let them go like this. One last time...""
 lsp.111.t:0 "Remembrance"
 lsp.111.d:0 "Rokenhar checks the pockets of his waistcoat once. Twice. Three times. He feels the letter, hanging heavy over his heart. "We miss you." He missed them too. And, at last today, he can finally see them again.\n\nIt was hard to come all the way here, across the border. Any journey outside of his house anymore was agonising, and the car ride to their house was torturous, both physically and mentally. Dread pummels his thoughts like an artillery of nightmares, and in the pit of his stomach, the coldest pang of guilt rises into his heart.\n\nHe's the one that left them. Left them here for his dream of Las Pegasus. For the city of dreams and wealth on the western shore of Equestria. And now, here he was, knocking on their door, on the brink of shattering, begging to see them one last time. Will they look at him with the same eyes they used to? Will Cello look at him and see his father, will Sapphire look at him and see her husband... or will they stare, and stare, and stare and realise that they didn't recognize him anymore?\n\nWell... there was no way to know without trying it. The dread has shaken him up enough, it was finally time to muster up the courage and... knock--\n\nThe door opens all too suddenly, before he even has a chance to raise his hoof. Were they... waiting for him? Sapphire stands in the doorway, looking at him with wide, bronze eyes. He has aged a dozen years in a single moon - she hasn't aged a day in years.\n\n"H-Hello..." Rokenhar wasn't one to stutter, but here, he couldn't push the words out. Not that it matters - the mare takes a bold step forward, wraps her hooves around him and tugs in a hug that leaves him both winded and... so, so relieved.\n\n"Come in... Cello will be home from violin practice soon, and I want to surprise you." She pulls out of the hug for only a moment, to look at him. In spite of his appearance, of how ragged and dishevelled he looked, she still leans forward to plant a warm kiss over his cheek. "We've missed you so much, dear...""
 lsp.111.a:0 ""I've missed you too...""
 lsp.112.t:0 "Recollection"
 lsp.112.d:0 "His side of the mattress was stiff after so many years of disuse, but the rest of the bedroom was impeccable. Sapphire was always a cleanfreak, after all - and it was nice to see all this time spent alone hadn't changed her.\n\nIt felt both so alien and so nostalgic to wake up not in the bed of his Las Pegasus home, but in the bed of his old house, lulled gently into waking by the savoury smell of sizzling bacon and eggs cooking downstairs.\n\nThough many things were not the same, anymore. The bed felt as if it was made of spikes. The stairs, each step felt like he was scaling a mountain. The light fizzling between the blinds seared his eyes. No longer was he the stallion he used to be.\n\nNor was the world around him the same as before. Cello, his child, no longer went to school. No longer ran around up and down the stairs and living room with youth's energy. No longer spent the mornings practicing his music in the living room. Now, Cello was more than a child, he was a respected violinist, with an orchestra, a schedule, a job. And though he was still his baby... Rokenhar wouldn't expect things to be the same.\n\n"Dear! Hurry up, your lunch is getting cold!" Sapphire shouts up the stairs. Lunch? Did he sleep in? And, more importantly - how is he going to scale down this flight of stairs.\n\nBack in his heydays, before his mayorship, he could run down them three steps at a time chasing after Cello, but now... he shudders thinking of trying to take a single step alone. That is, until he feels a warm hoof grab him gently.\n\n"Come on, dad. I'll help you." Cello smiles at him. It felt so odd seeing him so tall, so much better-built than he remembered.\n\n"Y-you..." Rokenhar can hardly find the words to describe what he was feeling. It didn't matter - Cello inherited his gregariousness.\n\n"Thought I'd be gone, huh? Don't even worry about it, father. Nobody will mind if I take a day off to be with family. Now, come on - we have a long day ahead of us.""

###DYNAMIC FOCUS LOC KEYS### 
 LSP_personal_1:0 "Maybe he should've done something. Reached out. At least attempted to make contact with his family again. With his lovely Sapphire, and his little Cello. As he wastes away, a lone maid occasionally checking in on him on his deathbed, he wonders what came of them. Hopefully they're okay."
 LSP_personal_2:0 "He tilts his head on his pillow. His mane is grey, and his eyes are sunken, but Sapphire looks as young as ever. Her hoof grips his, tightly. A shared smile is all he needs - it's only such a shame Cello couldn't have come too. She insists he's fine, but he wished he could see him in person, rather than in family photos alone."
 LSP_personal_3:0 "Cello's music fills the chamber as he plays the violin. Both Sapphire and Rokenhar watch, silently, smiling. He's entranced, the white stallion, with his instrument. But occasionally, a tear does fall from his eye mid-song - and when Rokenhar notices, a tear falls from his as well. Tears shed for a past lost - but, hopefully, thanks to his efforts... a future assured."
 LSP_heir_1:0 "Sugarquill allows herself in, another pony trailing right behind her. It's the 'perfect' one for the job, she insists. But just at a cursory glance of his file, Rokenhar knows he just won't last. He may be smiling now, but he won't have the same constitution he, the old stallion, did. But he doesn't have the energy to argue anymore. Maybe it will be as he feared. Las Pegasus will descend into political squabbles with him gone. So many good stories start with the death of an heirless King. Nothing good ever comes of them. But, he only nods to him - and smiles to Sugarquill. Though her efforts are in vain... they were appreciated nonetheless. All of her efforts."
 LSP_heir_2:0 "Sugarquill is nowhere to be seen. She's likely in her office, scrambling over reforms and wondering what to do now that Rokenhar will be gone. She'll have to run the city in his stead, now, but she'll have her hooves full dealing with rivals and ambitious politicians. A washed-up old bureaucrat from his Cabinet allows himself in. The ensuing conversation is sterile and emotionless, a pure formality. He just wishes he could see her one last time, before he goes. But she has too much work to do."
 LSP_heir_3:0 "Sugarquill allows herself in, dressed in a new mayoral uniform. She looks ready for the job - almost enthusiastic, even. He sees in her the same fight and spirit he remembers within himself, on that fateful day when independence was declared. She insisted this was a silly idea, to have her as the mayor. But Independence for Las Pegasus was a silly idea as well, and it turned out alright. Or so he hopes."
 LSP_mil_1:0 "A few other stallions make their way in. Decorated, uniformed generals of Las Pegasus' new army, reformed at Rokenhar's orders. They came to him to bid their farewells in secret and pay their respects privately. Though he fixed most of the military's issues, Rokenhar never handled the most important of them all. The army fights for him, and him alone. Once he's gone, the army will dissolve."
 LSP_mil_2:0 "Several other stallions make their way in. He recognizes few of them - though he trusts each and every one. When he cleaned house in the armed forces and removed every incompetent sympathizer he had to make do with, he made sure to fill these positions with trained, expert officers. And now, they're here to pay their respects. To assure him that, for his actions, they will fight for Las Pegasus to the very end. But can the same be said about the troops?"
 LSP_mil_3:0 "There's a thundering sound outside, almost loud enough to make the windows rattle in their frame. It's uncomfortable, but Rokenhar just about barely ushers himself out of bed to look outside and see what's happening with his own eyes. A military parade, going right by his window, as the army bids their farewell to their mayor. Soldiers wave, officers salute, generals nod respectfully. Las Pegasus will live on."
 LSP_law_1:0 "Whitehorn arrives as well, still dressed in his police uniform. Even as Rokenhar lies on his deathbed, the loyal officer cannot hold back his instincts, and he gives his weekly report. Crime on the streets of Las Pegasus is lowering. It will take a while for it to become acceptable - it will take a lot of stress and hard work. But all is not lost. Though Rokenhar will be gone, Whitehorn will carry on, he assures him."
 LSP_law_2:0 "Whitehorn arrives as well, dressed in a suit more fitting for a politician than an officer. Even as Rokenhar lies on his deathbed, the loyal stallion cannot hold back his instincts, and he gives his weekly report. Crime has already reached an acceptable level, and the police is working to keep it that way. What was once a chaotic nightmare of a nation is now, at last, a safe haven on the west coast of Equestria."
 LSP_law_3:0 "Whitehorn arrives as well, dressed in a slick, black uniform, the badge of the N.A.B. on his chest. Even as Rokenhar lies on his deathbed, the loyal stallion cannot hold back his instincts, and he gives his weekly report. The streets are clean. Government corruption is at a record low, and lowering still. The roads are safe, and nobody is afraid of going out after dark anymore. All thanks to Rokenhar, and his Bureau."
 LSP_ind_1:0 "He's handed a financial report, as well. The economy is recovering, gently. Industry is being rebuilt. Infrastructure is being repaired to accommodate independence. Slowly, but surely, things are returning to normal. The ponies are starting to at last have faith in the economy again. But things could yet be going faster..."
 LSP_ind_2:0 "He's handed a financial report, as well. The economy has made a full recovery since independence. Las Pegasus bustles with activity, with the whirr of industry, the buzz of manufacturing, the rolling sounds of roulette tables in the casinos and the clanks of dice on their poker tables. At last... prosperity."
 LSP_ind_3:0 "As Rokenhar examines the positive outcomes of his industrial reforms and the growing Pegasusian economy, someone else walks in as well - someone the mayor never expected to see. Starry Plough stands tall over him, but not with the aura of a political rival, but of an old warrior, looking at Rokenhar with respect. He doesn't say anything. He only puts a red rose pin on the nightstand and leaves."

 LSP_ask_for_charity_desc:0 "However humiliating it may be, Las Pegasus cannot survive without the help of its neighbours. With rations growing more and more meagre by the day, and with the hungry populace starting to look across the border fence to the giant Equestrian food stores, it's time we sent out emissaries requesting help."
 LSP_high_yield_crops:0 "No More Grapes"
 LSP_high_yield_crops_desc:0 "To survive the food crisis, we must make the best out of our situation, by maximizing the amount of efficiency extracted from our limited soil. Areas like viticulture, fruticulture and pasturing are not at all efficient in relation to the amount of space they take up, so we must refocus on planting high-yield plants like grain and maize."
 LSP_safe_from_famine:0 "Safe From Famine"
 LSP_safe_from_famine_desc:0 "All our efforts are finally paying off. Food yield is in the green - we're producing more than we're consuming. Granted, only barely more than we're consuming, but as time goes on, yield will slowly rise. Yet another crisis has been averted, and for the first time in a long time, ponies of Las Pegasus can enjoy full, unrationed meals."
 LSP_restore_order:0 "The Restoration Of Order"
 LSP_restore_order_desc:0 "Enough mucking about. With the political situation stabilized and the food issue sorted out, it's time Mayor Rokenhar put his hoof down. We've braved the worst of the storm, and we're finally ready to reap the rewards of our determination. Rejoining Equestria is an idea of the past. Las Pegasus can finally stand on its own legs. Order, at last."
 LSP_seize_assets:0 "Punish the Opportunists"
 LSP_seize_assets_desc:0 "In the chaos of secession, several corporations believed the government would collapse and, therefore, they instead decided to support more radical opposition fronts. It's about time we got back at them, and made sure to establish a loyal industrial base. This can also be a great opportunity to seize the assets of some unsavory ponies, such as Pine Chest."
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists:0 "Deal With the Harmonists"
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists_desc:0 "With the thoughts of reunification having left the minds of most citizens, we can finally pinpoint our efforts on stomping out any last, stubborn anti-independence movement. Offer amnesty to those who agree to stand down, and prepare the court for treason charges against those who remain adamantly pro-Equestrian."
 LSP_increased_police_presence:0 "Call the National Guard"
 LSP_increased_police_presence_desc:0 "A cursory look at the streets of Las Pegasus is enough to show that crime is not dying down at pace we had hoped for. The police department is still struggling to cope with the wave of criminals from the days of anarchy, so we must call for backup, in the form of the National Guard, until criminal activities lower."
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus:0 "The Mayor's Las Pegasus"
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus_desc:0 "The last anarchic cells have surrendered. Protests are finally a rarity. The value of the currency is rising, and the amount of "down with the government!" graffiti has declined drastically. Every pressing issue that plagued the city at the onset of independence has been dealt with, and finally, Mayor Rokenhar can have a breath of peace."
 LSP_military_rebuilding:0 "Reorganising the Army"
 LSP_military_rebuilding_desc:0 "It's about time we looked at our armed forces. The army has been largely neglected. It was always a "we'll fix it later" issue - but later is now, and Las Pegasus can wait no longer. We are threatened by Equestria on the daily, and it's about time we established a proper, professional army for our defense."
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence:0 "Integrate the Communists"
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the CLA is still a political party in our government, and it'd be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can't beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the reds, we'll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there's ever a war, at least they'll be the ones to die first." 
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence:0 "Integrate the Fascists"
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the PCA is still a political party in our government, and it'd be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can't beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the fascists, we'll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there's ever a war, at least they'll be the ones to die first."
 LSP_expand_national_guard:0 "Expand the National Guard"
 LSP_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "As the needs of our police force rise steadily with our growing prosperity and our growing criminal underworld, the National Guard has made multiple requests for extra personnel. It's about time we answered those requests and offered our boys some well-deserved help."
 LSP_restore_officer_corp:0 "Restore the Officer Corps"
 LSP_restore_officer_corp_desc:0 "Even after the political chaos that plagued Las Pegasus for so long, there's still a multitude of skilled officers ready to offer their services. A few extra medals and some adequately-oversized cigars later, they almost look the part."
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus:0 "The New Army"
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus_desc:0 "Soldiers, check. Guns, check. Generals, check. A lack of inner strife, check-check. We have all the ingredients to begin proper work on our armed forces. As the sun sets over Equestria, in the bronze light of dusk, the new army of Las Pegasus stands strong, proud, and ready to serve."
 LSP_global_las_pegasus:0 "Global Las Pegasus"
 LSP_global_las_pegasus_desc:0 "We've already established formal relations with other nations through our earlier trade agreements back during the famine, but it's about time we've stepped up our game. It's time to push Las Pegasus out onto the world stage, in all its revitalized, rebuilt glory."
 LSP_staunch_defiance:0 "Staunchly Defiant"
 LSP_staunch_defiance_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't need allies - all of our strength, our might, we've acquired facing all hardships alone. We are ready to finally stand on our own hooves, separate from any other power, ruled by a single will, governed by a single destiny. Las Pegasus stands alone, determined and ready. A rock of stability in a sea of chaos."
 LSP_defensive_mindset:0 "A Defensive Mindset"
 LSP_defensive_mindset_desc:0 "Las Pegasus, though strong, is dwarfed in size and population by its neighbours. We simply do not have the raw ponypower and resources needed to wage offensive warfare. Therefore, we will let our enemies come to us. Dig in. Prepare. Fight. And win. Let their blood fertilize our fields."
 LSP_the_lsp_rangers:0 "The Las Pegasus Rangers"
 LSP_the_lsp_rangers_desc:0 "Some officers of the National Guard and other facets of the military have shown a kind of ferocity, combat-excellence and superiority on the field that could match even Equestria's famed rangers. It's about time we established our own Ranger Corps. "
 LSP_creep_north:0 "Creep North"
 LSP_creep_north_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs room to breathe. Though we arguably have room southwards into Waffleland, the city hugs the northern border uneasily. It's about time we stretched out a little."
 LSP_creep_south:0 "Creep South"
 LSP_creep_south_desc:0 "Much of Waffleland is dominated by agriculture to fuel the main city, but even now, the food situation is unsteady at best. The lands south are vast and fertile, and could provide great opportunities for more food. All we need to do is kick out the communists there, which shouldn't be too much of an issue for us... or for anypony else, for that matter."
 LSP_consolidate_our_grip:0 "Consolidate Our Grip"
 LSP_consolidate_our_grip_desc:0 "It's time to hang up the hatchet. We've carved the territory we need out of our neighbours, now the question is all about integrating it into Las Pegasus proper."
 LSP_house_of_cards:0 "Reinforcing the House of Cards"
 LSP_house_of_cards_desc:0 "Though Las Pegasus is at last strong and stable, Mayor Rokenhar will not live long to see it. All of the chaos, the stress - it's taken a toll on the old pony. The days drag on, harder and harder, and it won't be long before he takes his last breath. Time is short. Las Pegasus was his dream, and he's all that holds the city together. Las Pegasus dies with Mayor Rokenhar. That cannot be allowed."
 LSP_post_military:0 "Ensure a Standing Army"
 LSP_post_military_desc:0 "The foundation of a strong military is set in place, though the troops are still green, and the officer core is still questionable. It's time to clean house - remove the corrupt officers, the incompetent generals, all of the consequences of earlier cronyism. Ensure Las Pegasus has a safe future."
 LSP_root_out_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
 LSP_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Much of Las Pegasus' army is comprised of ponies not particularly skilled, but which Rokenhar could trust at the time of its creation. Now that the threat of conflict is largely gone, we can afford a more diverse, and thus less corrupt, government. It's about time we've performed a general audit of the army's higher-ups - see who stays and who's got to go."
 LSP_dont_fight_for_me:0 "Fight for the City"
 LSP_dont_fight_for_me_desc:0 "We've been left with a strong core of competent, fiercely loyal officers. The only problem is who they are fiercely loyal to - Mayor Rokenhar. Once he leaves, the army will crumble back into corruption and croynism. We need to finally bring something to Las Pegasus - patriotism. Teach the soldiers to fight not for Mr. Rokenhar, but for the city. For the country. For its people. For Las Pegasus."
 LSP_post_industry:0 "Industrial Reform"
 LSP_post_industry_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is already a highly-urbanized and well-industrialized area, but that doesn't mean there's no room for improvement. Ensuring the people and entrepreneurs that the government hasn't forgotten about the economy will help the people have more faith in the market - and will give us more assets to work with, in the long term."
 LSP_fairer_taxation:0 "Fairer Taxation"
 LSP_fairer_taxation_desc:0 "It's about time we handled that issue. Yes, that issue. The big elephant in the room and the even bigger mountain of papers in the Ministry of Finance - taxation. Las Pegasus works on an Equestrian system which is ludicrously, almost comically unsuited for independence. Giving it a good overhaul will lead to overall fairer taxation, and thus a happier populace."
 LSP_reach_out_to_unions:0 "Reach out to the Unions"
 LSP_reach_out_to_unions_desc:0 "Though the communists were defeated, they still have a strong support base with the workers, unsurprisingly. Reaching out to them with promises of better worker conditions and pay could generously bridge the gap between them and the government, and finally disarm the ticking time-bomb attached to the economy that the trade unions have been."
 LSP_post_law:0 "Lay Down the Law"
 LSP_post_law_desc:0 "Though the police has been growing more and more efficient in handling the country's issues lately, it's still following a very crude, decentralized system of laws. Concentrating and assembling an easy-to-follow, strict-yet-fair law code will lift another stone off the country's back."
 LSP_actual_constitution:0 "An Actual Constitution"
 LSP_actual_constitution_desc:0 "Right now, Las Pegasus' "constitution" looks more like a school scrapbook than a government lawbook - full of scratches, footnotes, ink marks, parentheses and contraditions. Reforming it into a more concise book of fundamental laws and obligations for both the government and the population has been long overdue."
 LSP_proper_police:0 "Proper Police"
 LSP_proper_police_desc:0 "The Las Pegasus Metropolitan Police has served us well so far, but their days have finally come to an end. With a new constitution, independence, and a new law-code, it's time to throw out the old and bring out the new. The National Affairs Bureau - NAB. Coined by Rokenhar himself."
 LSP_post_heir:0 "Dark Times Ahead"
 LSP_post_heir_desc:0 "Las Pegasus can be as stable as Rokenhar can bring himself to make it - but if there's nobody to pick up the mantle after his death, all of that progress, that stability, that effort, will go to waste. Las Pegasus must not be allowed to fall into chaos again. In these uncertain times, an election is out of the question. We must find a suitable, competent heir."
 LSP_appoint_heir:0 "Appoint an Heir"
 LSP_appoint_heir_desc:0 "We have a lot of options to choose from. Everyone is eager to wield the reins of power, but there are only a few who are worthy. The more trustworthy civil servants are already combing through files and reports, and every possible candidate for the next mayor position goes through Rokenhar, first. Of course we're not going to call them "heir" - that'd put the monarchists in way too big a tizzy."
 LSP_ensure_smooth_succession:0 "Ensure a Smooth Succession"
 LSP_ensure_smooth_succession_desc:0 "We've found a good heir - loyal, fierce, and ready for the challenges Las Pegasus must face ahead. Now, we just need to make sure the people support them, and that they'll survive in the dog-eat-dog government. Thankfully, Mayor Rokenhar still has favours to cash in, and contacts he can call up, to ensure succession will be smooth, bloodless, and dramaless."
 LSP_post_personal:0 "Loose Ends"
 LSP_post_personal_desc:0 "Mayor Rokenhar has kept a family picture on his nighstand since Las Pegasus gained independence. For so long, the city has been his life. He's tried his best not to forget his family, his wife and son. But he never found time to return to them, with the city matters being so pressing. Now, in the twilight of his life, he can postpone them no longer. This may be his last chance to see them again."
 LSP_visit_family:0 "A Call To the Past"
 LSP_visit_family_desc:0 "He's been sending them letters, hoping for a reply. A message, a sign of life, anything. He's sent a new letter every single day, without a single sign. Until today. 'We miss you.' followed an address. At last, the passage of time seems less dreadful."
 LSP_bucket_list:0 "The Swan Song"
 LSP_bucket_list_desc:0 "There's a lot of things he wanted to try out, at one point. Gardening, for one. Or, well, learning to grow plants. Learning to play golf. Taking a trip to the Pinglands, at one point. The more the days wear on, the longer the list seems. Maybe he should tick off some of the items - make sure he leaves behind a legacy worth more than the city."
 LSP_expand_the_army:0 "Expand the Army"
 LSP_expand_the_army_desc:0 "After a cursory look, it's become very obvious that more ponies are needed to fill the ranks. A hoofful of recruits per trench won't do - we need artillerymen, snipers, shock-troops, riflemen, gunners, tankers. We have a long road ahead - but the journey from Las Pegasus to Canterlot begins with a single step."
 LSP_mayor_sup_fire:0 "Bomb the Tartarus Out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_sup_fire_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower for heroic charges or grand tsunamis of soldiers crashing into enemy lines as seen in action movies. Our soldiers' lives are precious -  shells, however, are cheap. Why fight, when we can just bombard our enemy to smithereens?"
 LSP_shell_assembly_lines:0 "Shell Assembly Lines"
 LSP_shell_assembly_lines_desc:0 "We can't bombard our enemies with spit and rocks - if we want our artillery to do more damage than a light spring rain, we have to make sure we have the shells to fire. Investing in more adquate production lines for artillery pieces will make sure a lack of armament will not be an issue."
 LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion:0 "Bigger Gun, Better Performance"
 LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus' artillery pieces are nothing to turn one's muzzle up at, it's wise to make sure we don't fall behind in the arms race. "Don't fix what ain't broke", as the old saying goes - but nothing stops us from improving our existing artillery."
 LSP_artillery_factories:0 "Artillery Factories"
 LSP_artillery_factories_desc:0 "As the army grows, the need for more artillery pieces to support our soldiers becomes apparent. Rather than putting undue strain on our other production centers, it'd be wiser to dedicate a whole new manufacturing sector for armament production."
 LSP_at_ap:0 "Eyes on the Sky"
 LSP_at_ap_desc:0 "We have big guns, yes - that's very good. But, those big guns are also immobile, and would be very easily targeted and destroyed by bombers or fast-moving tanks. Therefore, we should make sure that we don't leave them exposed by giving some attention to our anti-tank and anti-air capabilities."
 LSP_enhanced_rifles:0 "Improved Rifles"
 LSP_enhanced_rifles_desc:0 "As important as artillery is, it's still important that the soldier is ready and well-equipped. After all, the fire pieces only exist to soften up the enemy that the infantry must then fight - so we should make sure that said infantry only has access to the best weapons."
 LSP_not_one_wasted_life:0 "Not One Wasted Life"
 LSP_not_one_wasted_life_desc:0 "With our limited ponypower, it only makes sense that we make sure none of it goes to waste. Our soldiers should have access to the same care in the field that civilians get in the city, and that means mobile hospitals, field kitchens, intensive care units, better medicine - anything for the fighting pony."
 LSP_mayor_mob_war:0 "Outmaneuver the Tartarus Out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_mob_war_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower to fight a drawn-out war of attrition, to let the days on the calendar drag on. In warfare, time is not on the smaller nation's side. If we are to win, we must make sure victory would be swift, unchallengeable, and uncounterable. We must strike fast, kill fast, and win fast."
 LSP_we_need_tanks:0 "Armoured Spearhead"
 LSP_we_need_tanks_desc:0 "Strength, firepower, and raw armoured might. The tank makes or breaks a mobile army, and we must make sure that our own armour is the best of the best, the strongest of the strongest, if we want to survive. Our tanks will punch a hole into the enemy lines that our infantry will then exploit."
 LSP_motorised_and_mechanised:0 "Motorised Spine"
 LSP_motorised_and_mechanised_desc:0 "If the armour is the tip of the spearhead, the motorized brigades will be the hilt and spine. Once the tanks break a hole in the enemy defenses, our motorized and mechanised divisions will rush through and exploit the defensive gap, and crush our enemies before they even have a chance of fighting back."
 LSP_armor_factories:0 "Armour Factories"
 LSP_armor_factories_desc:0 "Tanks, half-tracks, and trucks are useful, but costly to build. If we want adequate production numbers, we have to make sure a decent portion of our industry focuses on supplying the front lines with the needed equipment."
 LSP_and_planes_too:0 "Strike From the Heavens"
 LSP_and_planes_too_desc:0 "We cannot simply rely on our ground forces for a breakthrough. If we want to rule the battlefield, we must focus on ruling the skies above it, first. Aerial supremacy must not be ignored, and we must make sure our fighters, bombers and CAS are among the best if we don't want the spear to crumble against the defense."
 LSP_you_will_use_mechanised_dammit:0 "Armoured Reliance"
 LSP_you_will_use_mechanised_dammit_desc:0 "The average soldier can only take so many bullets - which is not many at all. Armoured cars, however, are faster, stronger and more defensible than ponies. Introducing them to our field operations will only increase success rate on the battlefield."
 LSP_make_everything_cheaper:0 "Overhauled Production Methods"
 LSP_make_everything_cheaper_desc:0 "The dusty, hard-hooved workers on the manufacturing front have become expert craftsponies in the field of armour-production. Utilizing recent breakthroughs in factory efficiency, combined with new workman-expertise will only mean cheaper, more reliable armoured fighting vehicles for Las Pegasus."
 LSP_mayor_battleplan:0 "Outsmart the Tartarus Out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_battleplan_desc:0 "War is more than a soldier sitting in a foxhole. War is maps, plans, production numbers, lists and logistics. The generals, officers and captains are just as important as the soldiers themselves, and victory will best be achieved not through mindless fighting, but through tactful planning."
 LSP_gbp_path_gotta_have_engineers:0 "The Engineer Corps"
 LSP_gbp_path_gotta_have_engineers_desc:0 "The engineers stand as the new foundation of modern warfare - they dig the trenches the rifleponies wait in, they lay the minefields the rifleponies defend, they set up the artillery that supports the riflemen. They are the cornerstone of every plan, and a weak engineer core means a weak army."
 LSP_spawn_more_horses:0 "A Stronger Guard"
 LSP_spawn_more_horses_desc:0 "The National Guard are some of the most elite units Las Pegasus has to offer - strong, determined, courageous and loyal. Making sure that our army is an elite one should be a top priority, and strengthening the National Guard will, in turn, strengthen our army."
 LSP_cement_factories:0 "Cement Factories"
 LSP_cement_factories_desc:0 "Cement is the material of warfare. Lead builds bullets, steel builds tanks, aluminum builds planes... but cement builds bunkers, trenches, defense strongpoints. If we let our enemies come to us, we should be ready to give them a cold, concrete welcome."
 LSP_elite_weaponry:0 "Elite Weaponry"
 LSP_elite_weaponry_desc:0 "We are ponies - magic flows through our blood, our flesh, our muscles. Our magic is not just a crutch, a novelty, though. It's our biggest, strongest weapon. We must hone our skills with this weapon if we want victory."
 LSP_magic:0 "Magesoldiers"
 Lsp_magic_desc:0 "There is a thin line between warfare and wizardry. Our pegasi can rule the skies in place of planes, our earth ponies can charge forward in place of motorized, our unicorns can blast enemies away with all of the might of artillery. We have all of the ingredients for an army of wizards - we must only combine them."
 LSP_every_family_a_soldier:0 "Every Family a Soldier"
 LSP_every_family_a_soldier_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies. We are surrounded by nations jealous of Las Pegasus' wealth, power, and beauty. We are a lone rock in the churning sea of violence. To survive, we must fight. To survive, all must play their part - and there exists no part to play more honourable than service."
 
 ##ECONOMY FOCUSES##
 LSP_trading_economy:0 "Embracing Globalism"
 LSP_trading_economy_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is a bastion of potential growth. In the wartorn countryside left in the wake of the Equestrian Civil War, we stand tall and unscathed, the industrial machine ready to whirr the life with the force of an awoken tiger. We have everything others could want - why not give it to them? For a price, of course."
 LSP_connect_nation:0 "Connect the Nation"
 LSP_connect_nation_desc:0 "The dusty backroads of the labyrinthine spaghetti of highways across the nation - and especially in Waffleland - will simply not be enough for our plans of a vast, expansive trading economy. We need asphalt, railways, stations... we need to more properly connect Las Pegasus."
 LSP_tax_cut:0 "A Lil' Tax Cut"
 LSP_tax_cut_desc:0 "Money is the universal constant of growth - so Las Pegasus cannot grow if her citizens are spending all of their money on taxes. An itsy-bitsy tax cut will hardly impact our finances, and will in turn leave many entrepeneurs with just the financial surplus to kickstart new companies and industry."
 LSP_waffleland_resettlement_act:0 "Waffleand Resettlement Act"
 LSP_waffleland_resettlement_act_desc:0 "So many of the nation's newcomers head straight for the city and walk right by the sprawling, golden plains of Waffleland. A shame, really - it's a lovely place! New legislation should ensure that it will not end up barren, and that the economic gap between rural Waffleland and highly urbanized Las Pegasus will slowly be bridged."
 LSP_encourage_agriculture:0 "Encourage Agriculture"
 LSP_encourage_agriculture_desc:0 "The threat of famine is one long-conquered by Las Pegasus, and while the food stores are certainly not going to dry up anytime soon, it can never hurt to have a surplus, can it? Encouraging farming and agriculture will not only boost the economy, but also encourage population growth."
 LSP_economic_upswing:0 "Economic Upswing"
 LSP_economic_upswing_desc:0 "It was expected that we'd recover. After all, Las Pegasus is too large and finanfically well-off to be in the economic gutter for too long - but nobody quite expected such a quick and drastic upswing. It's safe to say, now, that the ponies have, at last, regained faith in the economy."
 LSP_expand_industrial_districts:0 "Expand the Industrial Districts"
 LSP_expand_industrial_districts_desc:0 "Unemployment is a thing of the past - now, companies are complaining about a lack of workers! Infrastructure projects to expand the industrial districts and to invite foreign labour will allow Las Pegasus to keep up with the ponypower demands."
 LSP_a_free_newspaper_industry:0 "Free Press"
 LSP_a_free_newspaper_industry_desc:0 "We have outgrown the red scare, or the PCA scare, or the-whatever-scare. Our ponies now have opinions the government doesn't need to be scared of, and we should allow them to speak their mind."
 LSP_arms_dealing:0 "Dealing in Arms"
 LSP_arms_dealing_desc:0 "Industry is more than refrigerators, radios, sports cars and typewriters. To some, it's bullets, machine guns, tanks and bombs. The economy runs on consumers during peace time, but should war come knocking on Las Pegasus' door, we'll have to make sure the enemy doesn't catch us with our pants down."
 LSP_booming_electronics_trade:0 "The Electronics Trade"
 LSP_booming_electronics_trade_desc:0 "As our understanding of electricity and circuits grow, we've come to understand that complex circuitry can have plenty of uses - from military applications in the form of radars and computers, to civilian goods like hairdriers, radios, etcetera. \n\nAnyone want a microwave?"
 LSP_trading_research:0 "Scientific Communities"
 LSP_trading_research_desc:0 "Embracing globalism has allowed Las Pegasus to procure specialized, trained ponies from every field and facet of society. From artists such as painters and musicians, to industrialists specializing in everything from car construction to armament production, and, of course, to scientists ready and eager to make the world a better place."
 ###Navy and Air Focuses##
 LSP_air_begun:0 "Birth of the Las Pegasus Air Force"
 LSP_air_begun_desc:0 "This is the modern world. No armed force can never fight without planes to protect them from aerial bombardment. It's time for Las Pegasus Planes to be equipped for action."
 LSP_repurpose_docks:0 "Converting the Las Pegasus Shipyard"
 LSP_repurpose_docks_desc:0 "We don't need ships, we need planes, and as much as possible! Let's scrap these shipyards and convert as much material as possible into working airplane factories that can get this air force running pronto."
 LSP_build_runways:0 "Expanding the Las Pegasus Airport"
 LSP_build_runways_desc:0 "The Las Pegasus Airport needs an upgrade. We definitely can be putting more fighters to bolster our air force. Let's make more runaways so we can fit more planes to fight in the Las Pegasus skies."
 LSP_our_air_doctrine:0 "A New Doctrine for a New Air Force"
 LSP_our_air_doctrine_desc:0 "A new airforce means a need for new strategies for the air war. We will have all our pilots and air commanders convene to form a new doctrine that defines the actions of our air force."
 LSP_fighters:0 "New Fighters On the Strip"
 LSP_fighters_desc:0 "Without good fighters, the skies will never remain in our hooves. Let's make sure we have the best fighters we can create to outmatch and drive off the air forces of others."
 LSP_bombers:0 "New Bombers On the Strip"
 LSP_bombers_desc:0 "Without good bombers. Our forces will be much weaker against any hostile attacking our ground forces. Let's make sure we have the best bombers to support our ground troops the best they can."
 LSP_aviation_streamlining:0 "More Planes the Better!"
 LSP_aviation_streamlining_desc:0 "We should be able to make our plane production more efficient and cost less with our new streamlined assembly process. We will be able to churn out new planes that can fill up the ranks of our air force faster than ever."
 LSP_navy_begun:0 "Birth of the Las Pegasus Navy"
 LSP_navy_begun_desc:0 "Let's face it. Our new country is dependent on oceanic trade to both survive and prosper. We must strengthen our navy to not only protect our coastlines but to protect our shipping."
 LSP_bigger_naval_base:0 "Enlargening the Las Pegasus Port"
 LSP_bigger_naval_base_desc:0 "With our independence, we cannot rely on inland trade as much anymore. We need to expand the port to accomodate more ships and more convoys for our newly fledgling navy."
 LSP_expand_docks:0 "Expanding the Las Pegasus Shipyard"
 LSP_expand_docks_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs a larger fleet in order to accomodate our new status. We should construct additional shipyards to account for the naval growth we are trying to achieve"
 LSP_our_naval_doctrine:0 "A New Doctrine For a New Navy"
 LSP_our_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "A new fleet means a need for new strategies for the naval war. We will have all our captains and admirals convene to form a new doctrine that defines the actions of our fleet."

 LSP_battleship:0 "A Classic Flagship"

 LSP_jewel_of_equus:0 "Jewel of Equus"
 LSP_jewel_of_equus_desc:0 "Our navy will be the jewel of the Equestrian seas! Our ship productions might soon be able to rival Skyfalls in enough time as we develop our fledging fleet."
