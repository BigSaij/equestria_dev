 ### Empire Events ###
 imperium.1.title:0 "A Shining Beacon"
 imperium.1.desc:0 "There have been multiple reports of power outage at a city in Yale. As yet, the cause of the outage has been claimed to be Yale University but the University itself refuses to publicly comment on the cause of the situation, and will field no questions levied at them. Moderate concern has been growing amongst citizenry in the local area, as ordinary griffs wonder what further disruption may arise from this odd instance. For the time being, however, the majority are continuing on with their daily lives and merely keeping a keen eye out for any weird happenings." #Mara
 imperium.1.a:0 "Peculiar, but science can be strange."

 imperium.2.title:0 "Goldener Thron"
 imperium.2.desc:0 "A call from Yale just reached the imperial palace, and it has sent the court into a frantic scramble. The University of Gamia has just informed us that they have been working on a secretive project that is nearing completion. The project is concerned with offering life support and indeed revitalization for the severely ill. Due to the massive power requirements needed, the project has not managed to finish the clinical stage, and it is only the Emperor's critical condition that has made the researchers offer their aid.\n\nThe suggestion is extraordinary, absurd almost, but they are offering to attempt putting his majesty into the device they have developed and empower it with all the magic that the empire can spare. If their calculations are correct, then his majesty may well recover from his long-standing illness. There is no way of knowing what the the side effects will be - their experiments thus far have been limited to rodents and the like - but as his majesty is fading fast, maybe it should be considered?"
 imperium.2.a:0 "If there is even a sliver of a chance, we must do it!"

 imperium.3.title:0 "Hope is the First Step on the Road to Disappointment."
 imperium.3.desc:0 "When the explosion had rocked the palace and the scream had echoed across the entire city, every eye in Griffenheim had turned to stare towards the center of imperial might. Confusion and shock had been the first response as the thick, billowing fog spewed forth from it to slowly begin to engulf the entire city. Air raid sirens had begun to wail accompanied by the clanging of metal on metal as the sight of the wheezing, blood-choking griffs that stumbled out of it delivered the next response: panic.\n\nChaos followed, and griffs fled in panic away from the deathly mist that had swallowed the palace and threatened to engulf the entire city. Hundreds of thousands ran, tens of thousands died, and as the evening began to fall the entire city was blanketed in gas and death. To make it even worse, attempts to fly over the city has ended in failure as the imperial palace radiates with ominous light - like a great terrible eye in the darkness covering the imperial city.\n\nNocreature knows what is going on, but the imperial hussars are donning protective gear and are desperately trying to re-enter the city. Their gas masks offer only meager protection, but though they choke and die one after one, any attempts to call them off has been ignored or indeed greeted with active hostility from the Diamond Dogs of the guard. Yet for the rest of the empire, there is only chaos as the heart of Griffonia has been torn out, leaving the body to slowly die."
 imperium.3.a:0 "This wasn't supposed to happen!"

 imperium.4.title:0 "The Damnation of Griffenheim."
 imperium.4.desc:0 "The Emperor is dead, choked to death in the deadly fog that now blankets Griffenheim. With him, most of the apparatus of state has scattered or died, and there is chaos across the Herzland. Neither the Emperor nor the Crown Prince appear to have escaped, and there is complete silence from the Imperial government. While it is taking some time for the fact to sink in, the truth is already clear. The Empire is effectively dead..."
 imperium.4.a:0 "And we are left to take charge of our own fate."

 imperium.5.title:0 "The Fracturing"
 imperium.5.desc:0 "With the near complete loss of the imperial government, the empire's constituent parts are breaking away one after another. There is barely even enough of a state left to put up the pretenses of a government, and when the imperial claw no longer provides guidance, the nations of the Herzland has to find it themselves. All that is left is region of Griffenheim itself; a city covered in gas and a countryside flooded with refugees."
 imperium.5.a:0 "Is this the end of the empire?"

 imperium.6.title:0 "Only in Death Does Duty End" #Sweet Chrysalis
 imperium.6.desc:0 "Griffons and Diamond dogs wearing gasmasks enter the city and move towards the palace. Once arrived in the throne room they find that the poison suddenly stops and and see the Emperor awake"
 imperium.6.a:0 ""

 imperium.3000.title:0 "Knowledge Is Power"
 imperium.3000.desc:0 "The throne room in the palace was filled with the resonating boom of a proclaiming, bassy voice as the Emperor finished his latest demands for information. A small troop of functionaries scuttled away in quite the hurry, eager to facilitate the request for knowledge. Sandy Scribes was one of these low level bureaucrats and information-mongers. The griffon darted this way and that, practically diving his way through the palace to find the administration records that were needed to placate his liege lord.\n\n"It must be here, I'm sure of it. Maybe here, or over there?" Sandy muttered, almost seeming possessed with a near-divine thirst to find the knowledge he knew was somewhere in the pile of records in this particular annex. A number of scrolls were nearly thrown out of the way as Sandy scrabbled, driven with a zeal to find that which had been requested. What irked him more was that he knew where the scrolls were, but could he lay a claw on them right at this moment, right at the time when they were needed? Of course not, and that was the infuriating part! Why was it always the case that the things one wanted to find or read were the in the most out of the way place?\n\nFinally, after what felt like a lesser eternity, Sandy saw the coded scroll markers that indicated he'd found the document series he needed. With a small caw of exultation, Sandy snatched at the small bundle of scrolls and peered through one or two in order to confirm these were correct.\n\n Yes, yes. Infrastructure reports, familial histories of the Empire in the recent decades, technical records for standard equipment and even diplomatic records from meetings with the other Reichspakt states. Intriguing. Still, there were all the things the Emperor had demanded. Hurridly, Sandy burst back out of the archives and to the throne room.\n\nPausing for just a moment outside the doors, he pat his head and tried to make himself look a little presentable, and after wiping off a little flopsweat he bowed his head in a supplicatory manner to enter and approach his liege." #Mara

It was meant to magically give the emperor the vitality to return from the brink, yet instead it has created chaos.

 GRI_AF_militarum_desc:0 "The armed forces of the Empire have been unsufficient thus far; a new tact must be taken. Herein, on this date, it is decreed that a new Militarum will be formed. The enemy of griffonkind will never be safe from our air, land or seaborne assaults."
 GRI_AF_next_generation_of_knights:0 "The Next Generation of Knights"
 GRI_AF_next_generation_of_knights_desc:0 "Noble Griffon knights have served the Empire thus far, but now it is time for a new age, a new generation of heavily armed and armoured knights. They shall be a beacon of inspiration to the other troops, a force to be reckoned with in their own right. A new elite for a new Imperium."
 GRI_AF_star_knights_specialization:0 "Star Knight Specialization"
 GRI_AF_star_knights_specialization_desc:0 "The new knight force will be best utilised as an offensive juggernaut, a powered fist which might pierce even the most resolute barrier. Their appearance on the battlefield will be enough to cause the enemy to waver and crumble, if their withering fire and power was not already sufficient."
 GRI_AF_star_knights_generalization:0 "Star Knight Generalization"
 GRI_AF_star_knights_generalization_desc:0 "This new generation of knights will serve as a mighty bulwark, a proud force able to shore up the tightest line and afford inspiration and determination in the Militarum. They will be best suited to holding the line when all others have fled in their duty."
 GRI_AF_extreme_training:0 "Extreme Training"
 GRI_AF_extreme_training_desc:0 "With a solid grounding for our new knights, there must also be a refinement of the training methods used in their creation. They shall be the finest tip of the spear, the great hammer of the Imperium. Whilst this may mean that they take longer to deploy, their effectiveness on the battlefield will leave no doubt as to their superiority."
 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest:0 "Imperium's Finest"
 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest_desc:0 "As our troops and knights have been inducted into a new purpose in the Imperium, so too must their leaders and commanders be given purpose. They shall be a beacon of inspiration, a standard to rally around, the centre of morale for every squad, platoon and company in the Militarum; And They Shall Know No Fear."
 GRI_AF_seize_industry_in_his_name:0 "Seize Industry in His Name"
 GRI_AF_seize_industry_in_his_name_desc:0 "There is no nobler purpose than to serve the Imperium, thus all manufacturing works should be diverted towards His cause. Whatever may have come before, no enterprise will remain private. All shall become used for the state, for the manufacturing of goods and arms to serve The Imperium. Those who do not relinquish their ironmongers and metalworks will be replaced with those who will."
 GRI_AF_fire_from_afar:0 "Fire From Afar"
 GRI_AF_fire_from_afar_desc:0 "Flattening an entrenched enemy position prior to our troops making an assault isn't just smart, it's good planning. Inspiration has struck in the Munitorum and designs are being drawn for new lethal artillery pieces that may accomplish this. They shall be a bane upon our foe, a blade pierced straight to the heart."
 GRI_AF_the_great_archival:0 "The Great Archival"
 GRI_AF_the_great_archival_desc:0 "Despite the changes applied to the Imperial armed forces, the noble griff at the centre is still the same, brave and stalwart. The road to perfection exists within each Imperial citizen and the natural affinity of our kind must be brought to use."
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force:0 "An Unrelenting Force"
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force_desc:0 "The Star Knights have become a force of devastation, a whirling dervish of doom upon their foes. The tip of the spear has been honed, but it must be thrust swiftly to catch the enemy off guard. Tactical assault squads should focus on high speed engagement and 'Shock and Awe' strategic aims. Even if surrounded, this means our Star Knights have plenty of directions to attack in!"
 GRI_AF_an_impenetrable_wall:0 "An Impenetrable Wall"
 GRI_AF_an_impenetrable_wall_desc:0 "Any enemy that engages our Star Knights is bold, but foolish. Their bravery has been shown to wither and crumble upon the great tide of our elite troops, and this should be reflected in their usage. No squad will break under enemy fire, for to break is abandon your duty to the Emperor and this is a crime which can never be forgiven."
 GRI_AF_a_wave_of_fire_and_metal:0 "A Wave of Fire and Metal"
 GRI_AF_a_wave_of_fire_and_metal_desc:0 "Our troops will now dominate both the air and land, our great military might shall never be denied from this moment forth. Any and all who oppose us will feel the true might of the Imperium. Woe betide any who dare."
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_sky:0 "To Cover The Sky"
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_sky_desc:0 "It is decreed that there be a rapid development of aerial assets, by which this mighty Imperium might be protected from the sky. Firstly, this requires aerial craft and the means with which to produce them."
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies:0 "Supremacy Of The Skies"
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies_desc:0 "Our aviators must gain experience and develop their aerial pursuits more - great thought has been put into doctrinal advantages that might increase the edge of our noble, brave griffs. Yet we must decide where to focus efforts - relentless firepower to smash the groundward enemy, or dogged aerial persistence to prevent intrusion in our skies."
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings:0 "Reinforce The Wings"
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings_desc:0 "Sending our new aerial units into battle without sufficient equipment and technology would be a waste of the Munitorum's effort, and waste is tantamount to treason. Ergo, a raft of engineered components will be produced to ensure our technological marvels outshine anything any enemy can produce. Our superiority must be maintained."
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses:0 "Flying Fortresses"
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses_desc:0 "As the noble griff is a powerful yet deftly agile creature, so too must our aircraft be fashioned in such a way as to be keen in the air, yet lethal to foes. Advancements in airframe development will allow us to shatter the spirit of any foe with timely explosive intervention."
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds:0 "The Biggest Birds"
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds_desc:0 "An enterprising designer has theorized that even larger airframes may carry vastly superior payloads. Creating these new heavy, large aerial units will allow us to absolutely flatten the enemy before our ground troops roll in. Whilst they might not be the most agile for air to air combat, their resilience should not be underestimated."
 GRI_AF_unleash_hellfire:0 "Unleash Hellfire!"
 GRI_AF_unleash_hellfire_desc:0 "And so, did the great guns and weapons of griffonkind loose their mighty onslaught upon their foes, and they who denied the Imperium were struck down. The instruments of His Will flew forth, and unleashed many barrels of hellfire."
 GRI_AF_designs_from_the_technocrats:0 "Designs From The Technocrats"
 GRI_AF_designs_from_the_technocrats_desc:0 "Many elightened minds have surfaced and will now be used by the Munitorum for creating and developing great engines and weapons of war. Those who may have been turned aside in the past shall be welcomed for their ingenuity."
 GRI_AF_streamlined_and_subsidized:0 "Streamlined and Subsidized"
 GRI_AF_streamlined_and_subsidized_desc:0 "With the advancements that have been made, refinement and increased iteration has been possible and thus, we can now see how to improve the aerial strategy to bring the Emperor's truth to the rest of the world. Domination of the skies will instantly shift any engagement towards our favour, before the first ground troop fires a rifle."
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_earth:0 "To Blanket The World"
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_earth_desc:0 "The new Militarum requires new weapons, as the old equipment laying around is grossly unsuited to the task. Master smiths and artisans have been levied to lend their strength in designing and manufacturing a new wave of equipment that will suit The Imperium's needs."
 GRI_AF_mobile_battering_rams:0 "Mobile Battering Rams"
 GRI_AF_mobile_battering_rams_desc:0 "Speed without strength is a foolish endeavour, and so the armoured works shall begin construction of new, mobile yet armoured chassis. These will be able to both punch holes in enemy formations, yet remain effective when faced with return fire."
 GRI_AF_crush_them_underneath:0 "Crush Them Underneath"
 GRI_AF_crush_them_underneath_desc:0 "Armoured units have been working well in conjunction with the greater Militarum efforts, however an iteration of the more mobile tanks has been suggested. This has been dubbed 'Project Baneblade' and will see rapid development of a heavier, upgunned tank unit to support our armoured fist. Where this tank rumbles, the enemy shall flee."
 GRI_AF_the_vehicles_of_war:0 "Vehicles of War"
 GRI_AF_the_vehicles_of_war_desc:0 "Some legacies from the Empire may be useful; the Changeling attaches were instrumental in demonstrating that. Now, we must develop a new Imperial warbeast, a fast and rapid threat on the battlefield. Something capable of encircling the slow, daundering infantry and cutting their supply lines."
 GRI_AF_steer_the_armories:0 "Steer The Armories"
 GRI_AF_steer_the_armories_desc:0 "With a great focus now being placed upon arms and armament, we must ensure that every able-bodied griff lends their claws in the manufactorums. Labour is not optional, and a great deal of space can be cleared to make room for new machining mills and smithies."
 GRI_AF_strengthen_the_mechanized_wave:0 "Strengthen The Mechanized Wave"
 GRI_AF_strengthen_the_mechanized_wave_desc:0 "The usage of trucks for logistics purposes is sensible, and good planning. There exists, however, a niche for an ultramobile yet still armoured unit somewhere between a lighter tank and a truck. Something which may exist alongside the infantry. These may make fine troop transports for getting infantry into battle and supporting them in engagements."
 GRI_AF_experiment_to_exterminate:0 "Experiment to Exterminate"
 GRI_AF_experiment_to_exterminate_desc:0 "Strategists have taken a great deal of time to plan and improve the Imperial force. However, unorthodox methodology may be called for. It is necessary that the Militarum adapt to these new ways of waging war, so as to solidify battlefield control. A number of new ideas have been submitted for integration, including new companies to support the troops and tactics for massacring the enemy."
 GRI_AF_cement_the_transformation:0 "Cement The Transformation"
 GRI_AF_cement_the_transformation_desc:0 "Creation of all these new technologies and methodologies is one thing, but cementing their usage on the battlefield is another. However, the Militarum has been nothing if not quick to adapt - a good thing, given that to fail in one's duty is to betray the Emperor."
