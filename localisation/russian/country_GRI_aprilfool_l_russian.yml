 ### Empire Events ###
 imperium.1.title:0 "Сияющий Маяк"
 imperium.1.desc:0 "Поступило множество отчётов о энергических выбросах в Йеле. На текущий момент, в причине выброса подозривается Йельский Университет, но сам Университет отказывается публично комментировать причину сложившейся ситуации и не собирается отвечать на вопросы. Беспокойство растёт среди местных жителей, пока обычное гриффоны думают, какие последствия могут возникнуть после этого странного случая. Однако в настоящее время большинство продолжает заниматься своей повседневной жизнью и просто внимательно следит за любыми странными событиями."
 imperium.1.a:0 "Peculiar, but science can be strange."

 imperium.2.title:0 "Золотой Трон"
 imperium.2.desc:0 "A call from Yale just reached the imperial palace, and it has sent the court into a frantic scramble. The University of Gamia has just informed us that they have been working on a secretive project that is nearing completion. The project is concerned with offering life support and indeed revitalization for the severely ill. Due to the massive power requirements needed, the project has not managed to finish the clinical stage, and it is only the Emperor's critical condition that has made the researchers offer their aid.\n\nThe suggestion is extraordinary, absurd almost, but they are offering to attempt putting his majesty into the device they have developed and empower it with all the magic that the empire can spare. If their calculations are correct, then his majesty may well recover from his long-standing illness. There is no way of knowing what the the side effects will be - their experiments thus far have been limited to rodents and the like - but as his majesty is fading fast, maybe it should be considered?"
 imperium.2.a:0 "If there is even a sliver of a chance, we must do it!"

 imperium.3.title:0 "Hope is the First Step on the Road to Disappointment."
 imperium.3.desc:0 "When the explosion had rocked the palace and the scream had echoed across the entire city, every eye in Griffenheim had turned to stare towards the center of imperial might. Confusion and shock had been the first response as the thick, billowing fog spewed forth from it to slowly begin to engulf the entire city. Air raid sirens had begun to wail accompanied by the clanging of metal on metal as the sight of the wheezing, blood-choking griffs that stumbled out of it delivered the next response: panic.\n\nChaos followed, and griffs fled in panic away from the deathly mist that had swallowed the palace and threatened to engulf the entire city. Hundreds of thousands ran, tens of thousands died, and as the evening began to fall the entire city was blanketed in gas and death. To make it even worse, attempts to fly over the city has ended in failure as the imperial palace radiates with ominous light - like a great terrible eye in the darkness covering the imperial city.\n\nNocreature knows what is going on, but the imperial hussars are donning protective gear and are desperately trying to re-enter the city. Their gas masks offer only meager protection, but though they choke and die one after one, any attempts to call them off has been ignored or indeed greeted with active hostility from the Diamond Dogs of the guard. Yet for the rest of the empire, there is only chaos as the heart of Griffonia has been torn out, leaving the body to slowly die."
 imperium.3.a:0 "This wasn't supposed to happen!"

 imperium.4.title:0 "The Damnation of Griffenheim."
 imperium.4.desc:0 "The Emperor is dead, choked to death in the deadly fog that now blankets Griffenheim. With him, most of the apparatus of state has scattered or died, and there is chaos across the Herzland. Neither the Emperor nor the Crown Prince appear to have escaped, and there is complete silence from the Imperial government. While it is taking some time for the fact to sink in, the truth is already clear. The Empire is effectively dead..."
 imperium.4.a:0 "And we are left to take charge of our own fate."

 imperium.5.title:0 "The Fracturing"
 imperium.5.desc:0 "With the near complete loss of the imperial government, the empire's constituent parts are breaking away one after another. There is barely even enough of a state left to put up the pretenses of a government, and when the imperial claw no longer provides guidance, the nations of the Herzland has to find it themselves. All that is left is region of Griffenheim itself; a city covered in gas and a countryside flooded with refugees."
 imperium.5.a:0 "Is this the end of the empire?"

 imperium.6.title:0 "Only in Death Does Duty End" #Sweet Chrysalis
 imperium.6.desc:0 """Keep moving dogs, we're almost there!" The sergeant yelled, even as he was left coughing hard enough that a metallic taste filled his mouth. The griffons had long since fallen behind, choking to death on the poison, and yet the surviving diamond dogs had kept moving. A trail of death had been left in their wake, soldier after soldier dropping dead, but they didn't care. Every bone in their body, every breath in their burning lungs and every trembling step they took all drove them towards a singular purpose; find the emperor!\n\nThe great doors of the throne room towered in front of them, the twenty still living dogs pushing against them in desperation. Their muscles heaved, adrenaline surged through their bodies and blood seeped from their lips as the doors  slowly were forced open with a groan like the very doors of Tartarus.\n\nAnd suddenly, all was quiet. The poisonous fog receded, and the dogs stepped slowly into the chamber and towards the light. Before them sat the emperor, wreathed in a gloria of golden light. All was quiet, and the dogs stumbled towards him in dazed reverence. Removing his gas mask, the sergeant fell to his knees as tears began to stream down his face. They had done it, they had reached him. Then, the emperor's eyes opened, the light turning blinding as he looked straight at the sergeant.\n\n"LOYALTY IS INDEED THE PURVIEW OF YOUR KIND, DOGS OF BRONZEHILL." The booming voice reverberated through the chamber, loudly enough that the sergeant would have recoiled had he not been frozen in the spot along with his soldiers. A wave of strength filled him, and the golden light reached out to touch him.\n\n"YOU WILL BE VIGILANCE UNENDING. YOU WILL BE DUTY UNSTINTING. YOU WILL BE PUNISHMENT INESCAPABLE. TODAY, YOU BECOME THE BRONZE CUSTODIANS, AND ALL SHALL FEAR YOUR WRATH." The emperor's voice rang in their ears as the glow encased them, stripping away their tattered uniforms and worn gas masks, leaving behind bronzed armor, thicker than any Ironpaw's. When the force holding him  in place vanished, the sergeant gasped, looking down at his paws before he looked up at the emperor again."
 imperium.6.a:0 "BRING MY MINISTERS BEFORE ME, CUSTODIANS, FOR THERE IS MUCH TO DO."

 imperium.61.title:0 "By the Emperor's Will"
 imperium.61.desc:0 "The teeming mass of ministers, generals and nobles stood in silence, watching their emperor where he sat upon the throne. They were in the hundreds, but the twenty massively armored dogs that surrounded them kept them all silent. Where they had gained these armors or the heavy glaives they held nogriff knew, but the looks in their eyes had prevented any expressions of curiosity. Doubly so for the emperor, who though he seemed like a corpse on the throne, was all too clearly alive and present by the bright glow in his eyes and the harsh words coming from him.\n\n"IT TOOK WEEKS, AND IN THE END IT WAS THESE, MY MOST LOYAL SUBJECTS, WHO REACHED ME." The bronze-clad diamond dogs did not react to the praise given, only continuing their silent vigil. "OUT OF AN ENTIRE EMPIRE, THESE WERE THE ONES WHO CAME TO MY SIDE. THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND WORTHY WHEREAS YOU ARE YET TO BE JUDGED. NOW SPEAK TO ME ON THE STATUS OF MY EMPIRE."\n\n"Y-your imperial majesty," it was general Ferdinand Dawnclaw who stepped forth. As confused as everygriff else, he could tell that the political chessboard had been flipped over, and those who wished to place their pieces upon it again would need to move swiftly. "The empire is in disarray. We thought you lost to this fog, and your vassals have started to break away. We have attempted to keep order, but all too many have seized their chance to abandon their oaths."\n\n"HAVE MESSAGES DELIVERED TO EACH OF MY ERRANT VASSALS, REMIND THEM OF THEIR OATHS, AND OF THE PUNISHMENT FOR TREASON." The words came so easily, the implication obvious. Through all his reign, Grover V had never spoken this harshly, and yet nogriff found it in themselvse to doubt him. "BRING THE SCIENTIST WHO CREATED THIS DEVICE BEFORE ME, AND MARSHAL ALL LOYAL FORCES. NEITHER I NOR THIS EMPIRE IS DEAD YET, AND THOSE WHO WOULD HASTEN ITS DEMISE SHALL PAY FOR THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS."" 
 imperium.61.a:0 "The Emperor speaks and we obey."

 imperium.7.title:0 "The Mad Savant of Gamia"
 imperium.7.desc:0 "BELISAR BOLZEN... YOU WERE AWARE OF WHAT WOULD COME TO PASS WHEN I WAS PUT INTO THIS DEVICE, WERE YOU NOT?" The emperor asked the old scientist that kneeled before him. The wild-eyed old griff had been tracked down to the basement in Gamia where he had been hiding and dragged before the emperor, and yet unlike all others who had come before him he was not struck mute, instead only cackling like a madgriff.\n\n"It came to me in a dream! I spent years upon years, stumbling in the dark, and yet insight came to me! The gods granted me insight into the machine, and I saw how to make you what you are today." He stared up at the emperor in manic glee, raising his claws in pleading towards him. "But my emperor, I offer you more than this! Give me only a chance to serve, and I shall make your forces the greatest in Griffonia, nay the world! I will sheathe your warriors in armor unlike any other, and I will arm them with weapons to break all that stand before them! You, the sun of the empire, will have a thousand brightly shining stars surrounding you! Just give me the tools, and I shall conjure everything you can imagine, and make every machine in the Herzland sing your praises!\n\n"SO BE IT. I NAME YOU ARCHRECTOR DOMINUS, AND IN YOUR CLAWS THE EMPIRE'S TECHNOLOGY OF WAR SHALL BE REBORN. RISE, ARCHRECTOR DOMINUS BELISAR BOLZEN, AND TELL ME WHAT YOU need."  
 imperium.7.a:0 "The machines sing the emperor's praise."

 imperium.8.title:0 "The Star Knights"
 imperium.8.desc:0 "A thousand chosen knights, nobles and heroes who had proved themselves loyal even in this time of crisis, had been summoned. They had undergone every experiment that the Archrector Dominus could subject them to. The Archrector had defied every convention, violated every firmly held belief in both metallurgy and enchantment, and his acts upon the bodies of these chosen warriors had left them unrecognizeable. In the wake of the experiments, the new weapons and the emperor's blessing stood something more than what had been before.\n\nThey would be the emperor's finest warriors, these griffs who gave of themselves to him. Like clay they had been moulded and in the furnace of war they would be forged. They were iron will and steely sinew. In great armour they were clad and with the mightiest weapons they were armed. They would be untouched by plague or disease; no sickness would blight them. They had such tactics, strategies and machines that no foe would best them in battle. They would be the empire's bulwark against the Terror. They were the Defenders of Griffonkind. They were the emperor's Star Knights..."" 
 imperium.8.a:0 "...and they would know no fear."

 imperium.9.title:0 "Nothing as Wretched or as Hated as a Traitor"
 imperium.9.desc:0 ""What is your purpose here, general?" The Archrector asked as Ferdinand Dawnclaw came striding into the great laboratory. Preoccupied with his experiments, he nevertheless noticed the general in the corner of his eye.\n\nYou're proving yourself day by day, Archrector," Ferdinand told him. "From a dinghy basement in Gamia where they were hiding you away because you had tenure, but had managed to alienate everyone else, to this. The Gods really favours the bold, do they not?"\n\n"There is only one god, and he sits atop the gilded throne. I did my part. You should be out there doing yours. Why are you here?"\n\n"Only one god, is there?" Dawnclaw asked as he approached slowly, dragging his claws along the table. "A brave statement. His power is not that absolute yet, is it? And he only is it because of your technology. Did you make a god did you?"\n\n"What are you-ack!" Belisar was stopped from replying when Dawnclaw's talons wrapped around his neck. The frail old griff grabbed his assailant's claws, trying to pry them away to no avail.\n\n"I spent decades of my life serving that wretch, only to have him reanimated by your sorcery!" Dawnclaw hissed. "And now he has the gall to deny me your enhancements!" Belisar croaked, desperately pulling at Dawnclaw's wrists. "I'm done dancing to that corpse's tune. If there is to be only one god, it'll be one of my choosing!"\n\nIn the end, Belisar's limp body hit the ground, and Dawnclaw turned to the table to begin rummaging around it. It all lay scattered in piles around the lab, and yet the Archrector had been fastidious about his notes. Lifting the documents from the table, Dawnclaw chuckled darkly to himself. Turning around, he passed by the Star Knights that had been waiting outside." 
 imperium.9.a:0 "We're heading to Cloudbury."

 imperium.10.title:0 "Let Griffonia Burn"
 imperium.10.desc:0 "The halls of power ran red with blood. In one fell strike, the revolution was undone and its leaders massacred. A single figure stood in the middle of the carnage, looking down at his blood-drenched gauntlets as he slowly laughed.\n\n"So this is what you were hiding from me, you old corpse?" Ferdinand Dawnclaw cackled as he slowly flexed his talons. The slow, gurgling sound caught his attention and he, without even looking, stomped hard down on the griff next to him, crushing his skull like nothing before walking out of the room. Outside, the hallway as well ran red with blood, and those who had not already been killed by his renegade Star Knights were being rounded up and brought out into the courtyard before him.\n\n"Do not fear, my fellow revolutionaries," Dawnclaw towered high above then as he addressed the crowd, feeling the violent changes he had gone through still aching in his body... it was a good pain! "Those fools you called leaders would only have led you to the grave. You have heard what has awakened in the Herzland, how that corpse of the dead emperor has refused to stay dead! What could your leaders possibly have offered against that?\n\nBy right of force, the force you wielded to try to unseat the emperor, I claim the revolution! Not against merely an empire or an emperor, but against he who claims to be a god! If he seeks to supplant the Three, then we shall become his Maar! We shall greet his claims to lordship with hatred, we shall defile his vaunted purity and turn the order he tries to bring to chaos! You have seen what this technology can do, and unlike him, I will share it willingly with whomsoever swears fealthy. A false god nests in Griffenheim, and his eyes will soon turn on you. When it does, blood is your destiny, but my gifts can make it his instead of yours. Do now cower, my fellow revolutionaries, for the continent will burn before us."" 
 imperium.10.a:0 "Death to the Corpse Emperor!"

 imperium.11.title:0 "(needs loc) This event is gives the player the change to switch to Chaos or continue playing the Imperium"
 imperium.11.desc:0 ""
 imperium.11.a:0 "Faith is purest when it is unquestioning."
 imperium.11.b:0 "Sanity is for the weak!"

 imperium.3000.title:0 "Knowledge Is Power"
 imperium.3000.desc:0 "The throne room in the palace was filled with the resonating boom of a proclaiming, bassy voice as the Emperor finished his latest demands for information. A small troop of functionaries scuttled away in quite the hurry, eager to facilitate the request for knowledge. Albrecht Deftplume was one of these low level bureaucrats and information-mongers. The griffon darted this way and that, practically diving his way through the palace to find the administration records that were needed to placate his liege lord.\n\n"It must be here, I'm sure of it. Maybe here, or over there?" Albrecht muttered, almost seeming possessed with a near-divine thirst to find the knowledge he knew was somewhere in the pile of records in this particular annex. A number of scrolls were nearly thrown out of the way as Albrecht scrabbled, driven with a zeal to find that which had been requested. What irked him more was that he knew where the scrolls were, but could he lay a claw on them right at this moment, right at the time when they were needed? Of course not, and that was the infuriating part! Why was it always the case that the things one wanted to find or read were the in the most out of the way place?\n\nFinally, after what felt like a lesser eternity, Albrecht saw the coded scroll markers that indicated he'd found the document series he needed. With a small caw of exultation, he snatched at the small bundle of scrolls and peered through one or two in order to confirm these were correct.\n\n Yes, yes. Infrastructure reports, familial histories of the Empire in the recent decades, technical records for standard equipment and even diplomatic records from meetings with the other Reichspakt states. Intriguing. Still, there were all the things the Emperor had demanded. Hurridly, the griff burst back out of the archives and to the throne room.\n\nPausing for just a moment outside the doors, he pat his head and tried to make himself look a little presentable, and after wiping off a little flopsweat he bowed his head in a supplicatory manner to enter and approach his liege." #Mara

 GRI_AF_militarum_desc:0 "The armed forces of the Empire have been unsufficient thus far; a new tact must be taken. Herein, on this date, it is decreed that a new Militarum will be formed. The enemy of griffonkind will never be safe from our air, land or seaborne assaults."
 GRI_AF_next_generation_of_knights:0 "The Next Generation of Knights"
 GRI_AF_next_generation_of_knights_desc:0 "Noble Griffon knights have served the Empire thus far, but now it is time for a new age, a new generation of heavily armed and armoured knights. They shall be a beacon of inspiration to the other troops, a force to be reckoned with in their own right. A new elite for a new Imperium."
 GRI_AF_star_knights_specialization:0 "Star Knight Specialization"
 GRI_AF_star_knights_specialization_desc:0 "The new knight force will be best utilised as an offensive juggernaut, a powered fist which might pierce even the most resolute barrier. Their appearance on the battlefield will be enough to cause the enemy to waver and crumble, if their withering fire and power was not already sufficient."
 GRI_AF_star_knights_generalization:0 "Star Knight Generalization"
 GRI_AF_star_knights_generalization_desc:0 "This new generation of knights will serve as a mighty bulwark, a proud force able to shore up the tightest line and afford inspiration and determination in the Militarum. They will be best suited to holding the line when all others have fled in their duty."
 GRI_AF_extreme_training:0 "Extreme Training"
 GRI_AF_extreme_training_desc:0 "With a solid grounding for our new knights, there must also be a refinement of the training methods used in their creation. They shall be the finest tip of the spear, the great hammer of the Imperium. Whilst this may mean that they take longer to deploy, their effectiveness on the battlefield will leave no doubt as to their superiority."
 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest:0 "Imperium's Finest"
 GRI_AF_imperiums_finest_desc:0 "As our troops and knights have been inducted into a new purpose in the Imperium, so too must their leaders and commanders be given purpose.

 GRI_AF_seize_industry_in_his_name:0 "Seize Industry in His Name"
 GRI_AF_seize_industry_in_his_name_desc:0 "There is no nobler purpose than to serve the Imperium, thus all manufacturing works should be diverted towards His cause. Whatever may have come before, no enterprise will remain private. All shall become used for the state, for the manufacturing of goods and arms to serve The Imperium. Those who do not relinquish their ironmongers and metalworks will be replaced with those who will."
 GRI_AF_fire_from_afar:0 "Fire From Afar"
 GRI_AF_fire_from_afar_desc:0 "Flattening an entrenched enemy position prior to our troops making an assault isn't just smart, it's good planning. Inspiration has struck in the Munitorum and designs are being drawn for new lethal artillery pieces that may accomplish this. They shall be a bane upon our foe, a blade pierced straight to the heart."
 GRI_AF_the_great_archival:0 "The Great Archival"
 GRI_AF_the_great_archival_desc:0 "Despite the changes applied to the Imperial armed forces, the noble griff at the centre is still the same, brave and stalwart. The road to perfection exists within each Imperial citizen and the natural affinity of our kind must be brought to use."
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force:0 "An Unrelenting Force"
 GRI_AF_an_unrelenting_force_desc:0 "The Star Knights have become a force of devastation, a whirling dervish of doom upon their foes. The tip of the spear has been honed, but it must be thrust swiftly to catch the enemy off guard. Tactical assault squads should focus on high speed engagement and 'Shock and Awe' strategic aims. Even if surrounded, this means our Star Knights have plenty of directions to attack in!"
 GRI_AF_an_impenetrable_wall:0 "An Impenetrable Wall"
 GRI_AF_an_impenetrable_wall_desc:0 "Any enemy that engages our Star Knights is bold, but foolish. Their bravery has been shown to wither and crumble upon the great tide of our elite troops, and this should be reflected in their usage. No squad will break under enemy fire, for to break is abandon your duty to the Emperor and this is a crime which can never be forgiven."

 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_sky:0 "To Cover The Sky"
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_sky_desc:0 "It is decreed that there be a rapid development of aerial assets, by which this mighty Imperium might be protected from the sky. Firstly, this requires aerial craft and the means with which to produce them."
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies:0 "Supremacy Of The Skies"
 GRI_AF_supremacy_of_the_skies_desc:0 "Our aviators must gain experience and develop their aerial pursuits more - great thought has been put into doctrinal advantages that might increase the edge of our noble, brave griffs. Yet we must decide where to focus efforts - relentless firepower to smash the groundward enemy, or dogged aerial persistence to prevent intrusion in our skies."
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings:0 "Reinforce The Wings"
 GRI_AF_reinforce_the_second_wings_desc:0 "Sending our new aerial units into battle without sufficient equipment and technology would be a waste of the Munitorum's effort, and waste is tantamount to treason. Ergo, a raft of engineered components will be produced to ensure our technological marvels outshine anything any enemy can produce. Our superiority must be maintained."
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses:0 "Flying Fortresses"
 GRI_AF_flying_fortresses_desc:0 "As the noble griff is a powerful yet deftly agile creature, so too must our aircraft be fashioned in such a way as to be keen in the air, yet lethal to foes. Advancements in airframe development will allow us to shatter the spirit of any foe with timely explosive intervention."
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds:0 "The Biggest Birds"
 GRI_AF_the_biggest_birds_desc:0 "An enterprising designer has theorized that even larger airframes may carry vastly superior payloads. Creating these new heavy, large aerial units will allow us to absolutely flatten the enemy before our ground troops roll in. Whilst they might not be the most agile for air to air combat, their resilience should not be underestimated."
 GRI_AF_unleash_hellfire:0 "Unleash Hellfire!"
 GRI_AF_unleash_hellfire_desc:0 "And so, did the great guns and weapons of griffonkind loose their mighty onslaught upon their foes, and they who denied the Imperium were struck down. The instruments of His Will flew forth, and unleashed many barrels of hellfire."

 GRI_AF_designs_from_the_technocrats_desc:0 "Many elightened minds have surfaced and will now be used by the Munitorum for creating and developing great engines and weapons of war. Those who may have been turned aside in the past shall be welcomed for their ingenuity."
 GRI_AF_streamlined_and_subsidized:0 "Streamlined and Subsidized"
 GRI_AF_streamlined_and_subsidized_desc:0 "With the advancements that have been made, refinement and increased iteration has been possible and thus, we can now see how to improve the aerial strategy to bring the Emperor's truth to the rest of the world. Domination of the skies will instantly shift any engagement towards our favour, before the first ground troop fires a rifle."
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_earth:0 "To Blanket The World"
 GRI_AF_to_cover_the_earth_desc:0 "The new Militarum requires new weapons, as the old equipment laying around is grossly unsuited to the task. Master smiths and artisans have been levied to lend their strength in designing and manufacturing a new wave of equipment that will suit The Imperium's needs."
 GRI_AF_mobile_battering_rams:0 "Mobile Battering Rams"
 GRI_AF_mobile_battering_rams_desc:0 "Speed without strength is a foolish endeavour, and so the armoured works shall begin construction of new, mobile yet armoured chassis. These will be able to both punch holes in enemy formations, yet remain effective when faced with return fire."
 GRI_AF_crush_them_underneath:0 "Crush Them Underneath"
 GRI_AF_crush_them_underneath_desc:0 "Armoured units have been working well in conjunction with the greater Militarum efforts, however an iteration of the more mobile tanks has been suggested. This has been dubbed 'Project Baneblade' and will see rapid development of a heavier, upgunned tank unit to support our armoured fist. Where this tank rumbles, the enemy shall flee."
 GRI_AF_the_vehicles_of_war:0 "Vehicles of War"
 GRI_AF_the_vehicles_of_war_desc:0 "Some legacies from the Empire may be useful; the Changeling attaches were instrumental in demonstrating that. Now, we must develop a new Imperial warbeast, a fast and rapid threat on the battlefield. Something capable of encircling the slow, daundering infantry and cutting their supply lines."
 GRI_AF_steer_the_armories:0 "Steer The Armories"
 GRI_AF_steer_the_armories_desc:0 "With a great focus now being placed upon arms and armament, we must ensure that every able-bodied griff lends their claws in the manufactorums. Labour is not optional, and a great deal of space can be cleared to make room for new machining mills and smithies."
 GRI_AF_strengthen_the_mechanized_wave:0 "Strengthen The Mechanized Wave"
 GRI_AF_strengthen_the_mechanized_wave_desc:0 "The usage of trucks for logistics purposes is sensible, and good planning. There exists, however, a niche for an ultramobile yet still armoured unit somewhere between a lighter tank and a truck. Something which may exist alongside the infantry. These may make fine troop transports for getting infantry into battle and supporting them in engagements."
 GRI_AF_experiment_to_exterminate:0 "Experiment to Exterminate"
 GRI_AF_experiment_to_exterminate_desc:0 "Strategists have taken a great deal of time to plan and improve the Imperial force. However, unorthodox methodology may be called for. It is necessary that the Militarum adapt to these new ways of waging war, so as to solidify battlefield control. A number of new ideas have been submitted for integration, including new companies to support the troops and tactics for massacring the enemy."
 GRI_AF_cement_the_transformation:0 "Cement The Transformation"
 GRI_AF_cement_the_transformation_desc:0 "Creation of all these new technologies and methodologies is one thing, but cementing their usage on the battlefield is another. However, the Militarum has been nothing if not quick to adapt - a good thing, given that to fail in one's duty is to betray the Emperor."
