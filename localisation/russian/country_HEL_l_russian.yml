HEL_reassure_the_anarchists:0 "Convince the Woodists"
HEL_reassure_the_anarchists_desc:0 "The anarchists have always been the ones most opposed to any central reform. If we can show them that democracy gives them a chance to express their views, maybe they can get on our side?"

HEL_the_fliger_air_corps_desc:0 "The Fliger Air Corps, founded some time ago in 981 ALB, are a band of Feathisian pilots exiled for smuggling resources on the Flowenan black market. For profit, curiosity, or pity, they have decided to stay in Adelart as the country's only real aerial prescence, which means to control any Adelartian airspace, one must deal with the Fligers and their immense extended family."

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine:0 "A Real Air Doctrine"
HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in investing in airfields or airplanes if we do not know how to use them. Thus with airfields built and the first Adelart planes in production, we have to establish an Adelartian aerial doctrine."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control.

#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Integrate The Sisters Of Eyr"
#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_merrimane_column_desc:0 "The Merrimane Column, a collection of international socialist revolutionaries from Equestria and left-wing veterans of the First Aquileian Revolution, settled in Adelart at the time of their own revolution in 987 ALB.

HEL_what_makes_us_griffons_desc:0 "It will do us no good to mindlessly import tactics of the West or South without any care for the races they are prescribed to.

#Democratic Decentralization Path

HEL_switzerland:0 "The Federal Council of Adelart"
HEL_switzerland_desc:0 "While direct democracy does provide our populace the most fair and equal way of participating in the governance of the state, certain examples of direct democracy across Griffonia have shown the problems such a system causes it's relied upon too much.

HEL_gun_rights:0 "A Gun For Every Griffon"
HEL_gun_rights_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising.

HEL_decentralized_education:0 "Autonomy For the Teachers"
HEL_decentralized_education_desc:0 "For a democratic, especially directly democratic, system to work, the populace needs to be knowledgeable enough to realize what is best for them.

HEL_a_centralized_democracy:0 "End Decentralization"
HEL_a_centralized_democracy_desc:0 "Direct deomcracy worked twenty years ago, but it has shown its constraints over the last two decades.

HEL_a_powerful_executive:0 "No Longer Just A Figurehead"
HEL_a_powerful_executive_desc:0 "The office of the Speaker has never been more then a way to honor our country's father in Merlock Wood.

HEL_polizei:0 "De Geheimdéngscht"
HEL_polizei_desc:0 "Our citizens deserve the right to a local security force, but across our territories we need a fair entity to enforce our nation's laws that is not limited by county lines.

HEL_centralize_the_church:0 "Religious Centralization"
HEL_centralize_the_church_desc:0 "There are many different congregations of Eyr in our lands. It is the idea of a madgriffon to simply let each have their own special permissions within Adelart.

HEL_agrarianism_focus_desc:0 "The majority of our population may reside in urban centers, but the true heart of Adelart is found outside of the cities.

HEL_social_funds:0 "A Social Fund"

HEL_a_better_figurehead_desc:0 "Merlock Wood is a hero to our people, despite his connections to the socialists. While we cannot persecute him for his political escapades, we can recall him from service and grant him a hero's retirement; effectively removing him from any real power."

Now that vanguardists control every apparatus of the Free Territory, it is time to do away with Merlock Wood, and begin Adelart's dawn as a true nation of the peasants and workers."

Our government was made to carry out the wishes of the peasants and people of Adelart, and every township has a voice at the national level. This decentralization has led to unprecented stability as each town feels like they have a say, but unfortunately, it has also caused political turmoil as major economic and political initiatives cannot be passed through many communities. This has led to the creation of many outright hostile communities that halt our political efforts by vetoing any processes to bring revolutionary ideology into their territory."

Further complicating these relations are his distributist economic policies, which have been met with harsh criticism by foreign and internal capitalists, who view Adelart more and more as a wayward province, taken over by idealistic bandits."

adelart.1.t:0 "20-й съезд народа и крестьян"
adelart.1.d:0 "— Приходите на великий народный съезд! Там будут услышаны все голоса и никого не проигнорируют! Ибо наша нация построена на великих обещаниях того, что все будут признаны и что все будут иметь право голоса!\n\nЭти слова открыли очередной, 20-й по счёту, съезд. Грифоны из всех уголков страны собрались, чтобы высказать свое мнение, и каждому было о чём поговорить. Но во всех вопросах - от простых споров до национальной политики - доминировала дискуссия о будущем нации и её управлении. Этот вопрос витал в воздухе уже некоторое время, и Мерлок Вуд пытался найти решение. И похоже, что теперь, на 20-м году своего правления, он, наконец, заставит все фракции съезда высказать свои аргументы.\n\nПервыми выступили анархисты - его старые товарищи и братья. Они считают, что нация не должна сворачивать со своего текущего курса. За исключением нескольких реформ и изменений, конечно. И они по-прежнему тверды в том, что нельзя ни в коем случае отказываться от традиционных свобод и вольностей нашего народа.\n\nВторыми высказались либералы. Они говорили о великих истинах республики и указывали на очевидные и явные недостатки нынешней анархической системы. — Вас уже никто больше не слушает! — с великим неодобрением заявили они, прежде чем Мерлок поднял свои когти. Либералы очень ясно донесли свою точку зрения до делегатов съезда.\n\nИ, наконец, слово взяли социалисты. Эти одетые в костюмы военных или промышленников грифоны говорят о мире за лесами и о мифических государствах вроде Сталлионграда, которые строят великие утопии для рабочих. И что наша нация должна объединиться и централизоваться под управлением рабочего правительства, если мы все хотим выжить.\n\nНо, как и в любом предыдущем съезде, заключительное слово всегда остаётся за защитником нации. Кого поддержит Мерлок?"
adelart.1.a:0 "Съезд решил сохранить традиции анархистов."
adelart.1.b:0 "Съезд решил реформироваться в либеральную демократию."
adelart.1.c:0 "Съезд решил централизоваться в партию коммунистического авангарда."

adelart.2.t:0 "Лесная демократия"
adelart.2.d:0 "Мерлок Вуд сидел на краешке деревянного кресла-качалки в своей лесной обители, что располагалась очень далеко от остатков правительства. И он обдумывал вопрос о том, что же теперь ему делать. Он знал, что его идеальная модель не выживет. Чистый анархизм не мог больше быть путём в будущее.\n\nНо как же права и свободы, за защиту которых он так долго боролся? Что делать с маленькими грифонами, которые хотели иметь свой собственный голос?\n\nЧто будет с их свободой? Он сидел, размышляя и обдумывая все свои потенциальные выборы, а потом наступил момент просветления...\n\nНичего. Ничего не случится с их свободой. Он мог бы построить настоящую республику. Но не такую, как те, что были скованы чудовищными бюрократическими путами. А такую, что действительно работает на народ. Где нация и граждане будут едины."
adelart.2.a:0 "Свобода и демократия!"

adelart.3.t:0 "Встреча в глубинах леса"
adelart.3.d:0 "Мерлок Вуд недовольно сидел в ветхом старом доме в глубине сельской местности.\n\n— Церковники... — пробормотал он. — Почему мне нужно работать с ними?\n\nМерлок отнюдь не был благочестивым грифоном. Он прислушивался к богам, как и любой другой религиозный грифон. Просто его всегда раздражал баланс власти духовенства в его землях... а сейчас он решил централизовать государство в республику, что очень не нравилось многим представителям духовенства, пожелавшим сохранить своё право на самоуправление.\n\nА самым неприятным было то, что Мерлок не знал, с кем он встречается. Это мог быть кто угодно. Он достаточно доверял духовенству, чтобы не подозревать их в том, что они пытались устроить на него покушение или что-то в этом духе. Но это был не первый раз, когда кто-то пытался устроить нечто подобное и терпел неудачу. Мерлок знал, что этот вопрос должен быть решен раз и навсегда, иначе его страна никогда не сможет стать достойной демократией.\n\nСтук в дверь? Кто же пришёл?\n\nНо когда Мерлок открыл дверь и увидел гостя, то он заулыбался. Перед ним стоял священник по имени Лука Лиссейский.\n\nОн может работать с этим грифоном."
adelart.3.a:0 "Рад снова видеть тебя, Лука."

adelart.4.t:0 "Rallying The Democrats"
adelart.4.d:0 "The first thing Wood did after his decision for democracy was to begin to call in the various elements he knew he would need to court to build stability for his nation.\n\n First of these were those Liberals who all spoke at the council. He would make them aware of his intentions and try to rally them to assist him in his new efforts to reform the nation.\n\nMessangers ran out across the country from Eagleton and far beyond to gather as many members of the Liberal communities as possible to try to form up a new proto-government, to prepare for the day when elections will be held properly."
adelart.4.a:0 "Democracy will come to Adelart!"

adelart.5.t:0 "Securing The Forest Brothers"
adelart.5.d:0 "When Merlock Wood assumed full leadership over Adelhart, he abdicated leadership of his mercenary group the "Forest Brothers" to a trusted friend nicknamed Lil Bron.\n\nThey remained in a low profile to hide from those forces that would root out their tendency to cause a little thing called "Liberty".\n\nSo Merlock ventured out alone to the deepest parts of the forest to put up their ancient signal. He knew not how they would find him and return to Adelart, but he knew they would. As he took the black powder and threw it over the ancient spruce while carving the sigil of the Brothers into the trunk, he thought about how he wanted to see them all again, and how much he could use their help. To finish the call, he took out the burning twig of a mulberry bush and tossed it onto the tree, producing a deep purple smoke for all of his brothers to see.\n\nA rustling in the trees?! Merlock grabbed his rifle, ready to defend himself one last time, but before he could draw fully, an arrow struck the pouch out of his hand. And a figure emerged from the treeline...\n\n"Hey Merlock." The enormous griffon spoke with a comforting tone, "I knew you would need us back eventually." "
adelart.5.a:0 "Damn it Bron, you almost gave me a heart attack..."

adelart.6.t:0 "Convincing The Anarchists"
adelart.6.d:0 "With the Liberals and his old friends behind him, Merlock now had to embark on his greatest quest of all. Getting the anarchists to be... well less anarchist. They would hold a great convention in the old Sherif's building, a symbolic home of the revolution in Adelart and hammer out the policy. The presence of the Liberal politicians and the great heroes of the revolution really took some pressure off of Merlock's shoulders. As he could simply let them all talk, so he didn't have to speak down to his comrades. He knew what needed to be done. Now they just had to be convinced."
adelart.6.a:0 "See! Representative democracy is good!"

adelart.7.t:0 "The Dawn Of True Democracy"
adelart.7.d:0 "With the Liberals, the Clergy, and the Anarchists all general on board with the whole "normal democracy" thing, we can now finally come together for elections in our nation.\n\nAs soon as Merlock got everyone to Eagleton, the most experienced among them had to explain the concept of a "political party" to some of the delegates in attendance. But once that initial hurdle had been crossed, three parties emerged for the voters of Adelart to pick from. First, the Anarchists and far left Liberals banded together to form the Socialist party, campaigning to keep up with the modern labor standards of the nation and to keep much of the traditional attitudes of decentralized power. They have a strong base of support primarily in the 20 years of the revolutionary history of the nation.\n\nMany of the Liberals have also come together under the Adelartian Democratic Party to put forward a more traditional republican government for the country. They promise more centralization and have support mainly from the new middle class and griffons not so enthused with the revolution twenty years prior.\n\nLastly are the Borean conservatives. A party backed by many religious parties in the nation and promising to put the Gods first in national policy. With that comes many things but the primary support for the party comes from the backing of Luca vun Lissay.\n\nThe Clergy and Anarchists have expressed a desire to see Wood and Lissay lead the nation, but the Adelartian Democrats are less convinced.\n\nWho shall win the elections?"
adelart.7.a:0 "The Socialist Coalition!"
adelart.7.b:0 "The Adelartian Democrats!"
adelart.7.c:0 "The Eyrist Conservatives!"
adelart.7.e:0 "Jaume de Conard?"

adelart.8.t:0 "A Peaceful Resolution?"
adelart.8.d:0 "Merlock wood sat in his bedroom, tapping at his desk with a pen, he was trying to think of how to go forward from here. A plan of action was needed to usher the Free Territory into the new future of anarchism.\n\nOr perhaps... a plan of inaction? For twenty years he had led the nation by taking action when it was needed, and sitting back and doing near nothing when it wasn't required. What if he could apply this same idea to his situation in the present day? Gentle pushes here and there, but generally allowing the towns to do as they need to fix their own issues.\n\nHuh, nothing never sounded so good."
adelart.8.a:0 "All we need is peace, love, and cooperation, right?"

adelart.9.t:0 "Mobilizing The Militias"
adelart.9.d:0 ""
adelart.9.a:0 "Time to root out these enemies of freedom."

adelart.10.t:0 "On The Matters Of The Sheriff"
adelart.10.d:0 "A specter stalks Adelhard... it is the dark memory of the sheriff's reign over the land, and how he suppressed all the freedoms of the people. And yet many still support his return, mainly based on that crazy concept called "monarchy".\n\nLately our policy of not interfering with many of the communities in the nation has brought to the front some of those who do support this return. And now we must decide our path of action...\n\nWe could easily send in some troops to try to disperse these communities, though this does go against much of what we believe.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to convince them of our benefits by investing in their regions to show our good grace to them as citizens. Though they could turn this aginst us...\n\nOr... we could do nothing. Let the fools burn themselves out, or burn us up...\n\nWhat to choose?"
adelart.10.a:0 "It would be undemocratic to take direct or indirect action."
adelart.10.b:0 "Perhaps some local development will bring them back to the cause?"
adelart.10.c:0 "Are we mad? Send in the troops to these disloyal communities!"

adelart.11.t:0 "An Industrial Grant"
adelart.11.d:0 "We have made our decision to invest in the rebel regions and so see where that gets us with their loyalty. Now the only choice is what we should do. A simple thing would be to build more roads to carry ideas and, if needed, troops to the region, which will connect them to Adelart as a whole. Though, many of the areas loyal to the Sheriff are religious communities, if we were to build a new temple, they might be easily swayed to our side."
adelart.11.a:0 "Build a couple of new roads."
adelart.11.b:0 "Build a new temple to the three Gods."

adelart.12.t:0 "Pro-Greifwald Activity Increases"
adelart.12.d:0 "Mixed reports are coming in... but it seems our efforts have backfired. Activities in support of the sheriff's return have increased in our nation. We must be careful of how we proceed from this point onwards..."
adelart.12.a:0 "Oops."

adelart.13.t:0 "Making Our Move"
adelart.13.d:0 "The choice has been made that we shall send in armed forces to remove the supporters of the sheriff from their communities and restore order. Now we must decide how we go about this. An easy and straightforward way to go through with the plan would be to hire a passing group of mercenaries to get the dirty work done for us, and to ensure none of our citizens fall in the effort. The downside being well... they are mercenaries. The alternative is our own citizen soldiers, though deaths in this operation could cause great pain to our prestige."
adelart.13.a:0 "Hire a cheap mercenary band to root them out."
adelart.13.b:0 "Raise a popular militia brigade to bring them to justice."

adelart.14.t:0 "Our Mercenaries Defect!"
adelart.14.d:0 "Terrible news! It appears the Sheriff himself has been found... but in the worst way. It seems he had a large reserve of cash lying around and has bribed our mercenaries to serve with him instead of taking down his rebellious communities. They are now emboldened against our government. We must be cautious..."
adelart.14.a:0 "Why did we trust them??!!"

adelart.15.t:0 "Decrease In Pro-Sheriff Activity"
adelart.15.d:0 "Our efforts have borne fruit. It appears efforts to support the sheriff have taken a steep decline recently. We may now sleep a bit safer.\n\nAnd maybe without guns under our pillows."
adelart.15.a:0 "Excellent."

adelart.16.t:0 "The Issue Of Decentralization"
adelart.16.d:0 "With our non-involvement policy we must now decide to what degree that shall go. We already have prolific decentralization throughout our nation, and only some of the most far flung, miniscule, and unimportant communities do not yet have a full role in teh coices of the nation. We could easily rectify this, but do we really want to spread our control that thin? We could easily keep the current system as well. Which would keep our citizens content."
adelart.16.a:0 "I think our current level is just fine..."
adelart.16.b:0 "Some townships STILL don't have a voice!"

adelart.17.t:0 "Ending Temple Autonomy"
adelart.17.d:0 "The temple, while an essential part of our nation, hold too much power in our society. Powerful figures are able to rally people to violence that could be directed against our government at any time. And so the conclusion is brought we must revoke the majority of temple lands and bring them in line with the rest of the nation. Though this is bound to cause hostility on their part. A simpler alternative is to simply stop funding themselves and setting them out to survive on their own. Which, while not granting us the full benefits of their wealth; would keep them at least placated."
adelart.17.a:0 "Seize their land and slash their autonomy!"
adelart.17.b:0 "Only stop giving the temple reperations."

adelart.18.t:0 "The Sheriff Strikes"
adelart.18.d:0 ""
adelart.18.a:0 "Order, justice, and stability for Adelart."
adelart.18.b:0 "Excellent, but our place is not with Greifwald."

adelart.19.t:0 "A Bright Day in Adelart"
adelart.19.d:0 "The day was peaceful, and the forest birds sang as the sun rose on the law's victory. The Sherif of Adelart sat content. Thumbing through some paperwork, he saw reports of Woodests all across the land being culled by this restoration. The violent tendencies of revolutionaries would be wiped away, and peace would come to the forests. Now began the work of administration, and all shall return to as it was before that Anarchist Wood ever tainted this land.\n\nThen, a knock came upon the Sheriff's door. Putting down his quill and parchment, Nottemagne opened the door. A nervous page sat waiting for him outside the door, "Sherif, sir, you have a priest here to see you." he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "But it's not just that..."\n\nNottemagne laughed and pushed the page to the side, "Ah, yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, "And I am sure whatever surprise they have waiting for me will surely be a great one!" The Sherif was happy. He had always been faithful to Boreas above, removing the godless communists and doing his service to the rightful prelate of Griefwald. Now all his hard work was coming back to repay him.\n\nMoving down the hallways of his office in Eagleton, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way, he noticed most of the usual staff did not seem to be there. It must be Saturday he presumed, and moved along. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside, a rhythmic droning that rattled his skull and shook his mind. Pushing through, he exited the building and suddenly stopped, digging his talons into the floor, he tried to stammer out words but could not. In front of him stood rows and rows of griffons in the robes of peasants and religious orders lined up with various relics and tomes in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the Archons in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most frightening of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon the most, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power and your life! The true believers shall have a home once more in these sacred forests! For Boreas, who leads us, Eyr, who feeds us, and Arcturus, who sends you to damnation!"\n\nWith this, the Sherif felt a sharpness on his back. Turning around, he saw Sister Selena, leader of the sisters of Eyr, with a blade on the back of his neck. "By the will of the gods, you are dethroned Sherif."\n\n"Because Eyr has come to Adelart.""

adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called “Vanguardists” cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as “betrayal of the socialist ideal” and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."
adelart.29.a:0 "A commendable move."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and the rare government minister who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs,at one point in history asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

Worship of the forest deity, questioned revelers claim, was a centuries old tradition among the isolated peasants, which many claim predated the establishment of the Trinitarian faith all together. Effigies of Fichtl, a tree with a Griffonian face upon it, have been found all across the forest towns, hand-crafted, woven, and stuffed by local artisans, while local bards sing the songs of the faith to adoring crowds.\n\nOutraged Old Believer authorities have labeled the movement heresy and idolatry, and a local priest noted that the effigies of the god were "unsettling to the point where I thought a Maarite spirit had brought such disgust and rancor upon my soul". The local council leader claims that the festivals were all "in good fun" and that mobs of Old Believer followers were making a fuss over a centuries-old tradition. Fichtlites interviewed merely claimed the festivals were a way to "appreciate the bounty of Fichtl and call attention to the lovely environment we all share, and which is being destroyed by the march of industry", and that the childish effigies were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nWith the Old Believers and community leaders at odds, it falls to [Root.Getleader] to determine the fate of this obscure festival. The question is - could these festivals be merely be cover stories for heresy?"

Striving for "a reformation of the Griffonian faith", the Prophet of Eyr, as his supporters call him, has developed a dangerous movement - one that might see more and more griffons come under its sway."

###LEADERS###

jacob_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 974 in Conard\n\n§YBiography§!: Jaume de Conard was 6 when the Adelartian Revolution broke out, and the bonds that tied them to the ancient monarchy of Greifwald were forever broken. But to think that Jaume ever stayed in Adelart with its new collectivist government in power would be wildly incorrect. His family, mostly capitalists loyal to the County of Greifwald, moved to Flowena, at that point suffering from its own declaration of independence from Pomovarra. De Conard, a quick learner and ruthless capitalist, soon rose through the ranks of Flowena's school system, graduating with a degree in economics.\n\nAfter his brief stint in Flowena, De Conard soon moved to Conard, in Adelart, his old home, where he campaigned for the end of the "peasant's government" of Merlock Wood and the fall of "tyrannical collectivism". Soon, De Conard helped to found the Conard Academy Of Arts And Sciences, and took a brief job as a designer for the Adelartian army, creating budget versions of Imperial tanks, but none of his jobs truly spoke to him.\n\nIn 1003, blessed with a unique opportunity, De Conard began talks with the Flowenan government about a possible takeover in Adelart - to ensure that the vast oil reserves of the Lissay were entrusted to loyal and hard-working griffons. While Flowena pulled the strings behind Adelart's new democratic reforms, unbeknownst to even the government, De Conard watched and waited until his time to strike - and now, Adelart is his.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean de Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the church, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place. As long as he is in charge, the nobles shall once more flee in terror, and the faithless shall do nothing more but bow their heads to the Gods above.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
luca_archon_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Archon Venia III, prophet of Eyr and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Venia III was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Arhconate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is perhaps most odd, then, than the griffon who was so fanatically against the Archonate, would become one himself, the Archon of Eyr and leader of the faithful of Griffonia. However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power. No longer shall Venia III's Archons be chosen by oligarchy and nobility - they shall be chosen from and by the truly faithful, wherever they may be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
selena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 961 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: Selena Krafsherr has been fighting for the faith her entire life. Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

sheriff_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of November, 951 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: No one is quite sure how the Sheriff of Adelart is still alive, with all the vitriol and hatred levied against him, nor how he has continued to be a sizable thorn in the side of the Adelartian government. 20 years ago, Jean de Nottemagne pursued the bandit Merlock Wood and his allies in the Old Believer faith, raiding towns, demanding taxes and levies from peasants who might have hoarded him and his rebel allies. Now, however, the tables have turned. Merlock Wood is the leader of a free territory for griffons of all stripes, while Nottemagne has been forced from town to town with a small army of loyal griffs and armed tax collectors.\n\nNottemagne, however, has emulated Wood's elusive spirit, and is never found at the same town twice. While mercenaries and Forest Brothers alike pursue him, the Sheriff of Adelart always stays one step ahead, raiding villages for taxes to fill his war chest and griffons to join his roving army. When Forest Brothers catch him, the Sheriff's forces fight like rabid beasts, the Sheriff front and center at the vanguard. He may have lost an eye and all of his dignity in the guerilla war against his former domain, but his perserverance has not wavered.\n\nAdelart will be cleansed from banditry, and the Sheriff will regain his rightful seat!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

wood_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YAllegiance§!: §RWoodist Communities§!\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nAlthough Wood's skills have soured in recent years, he is still an incredibly competent commander, and hero to Adelart's people.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
trouillard_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of July, 965 in Vilistel\n\n§YAllegiance§!: §gSheriff of Adelart§!\n\n§YBiography§!: Nobody is entirely sure why Jacques Trouillard is still fighting on the side of Merlock Wood. A notable monarchist who does not even try to hide his distaste for the free territory's unique democracy, Trouillard fought in the revolution against Greifwald for Adelartian patriotism, not for Wood's values.\n\nEventually, Trouillard would leave Wood's Forest Brothers, and although he continued to serve in the armed forces, his loyalty toward Wood's government quickly faded. Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"
