### ALL THE FOCUSES OF ADELART ###

### National Focuses - Opening Tree ###

# The opening tree reacts to the balance of power that Merlock Wood has to initiate as the leader of Adelart and its communities - everything is so decentralized that the initial disparate band of revolutionaries has now formed factions vying for power - Merlock here can make certain options that will move Adelart in vastly different directions

HEL_merlocks_twentieth_year:0 "Двадцать лет свободы!"
HEL_merlocks_twentieth_year_desc:0 "Хотя времена сейчас тяжелые и шериф всё ещё пытается вернуть себе власть, которой он когда-то обладал, Аделарт остаётся свободным от тирании. В эту счастливую годовщину мы все вместе отпразднуем нашу независимость; конечно, если ничто не испортит праздник."

HEL_descieuxs_petition:0 "Петиция эмигрантов"
HEL_descieuxs_petition_desc:0 "Эмигрантам есть что сказать о том, как управляется наше маленькое государство, и они редко с любовью отзываются о Вуде. Они признают, что его лидерство было необходимо для начала революции, но они также считают, что Мерлок принимает неправильные решения. Возможно, после столь заслуженного празднования он действительно прислушается к этой группе грифонов."

HEL_advance_the_revolution:0 "Улучшить революцию"
HEL_advance_the_revolution_desc:0 "К всеобщему удивлению, Вуд согласился поддержать социалистов и сотрудничать с Дескье по большинству вопросов, касающихся создания государства. Впрочем, неясно, почему он принял именно такое решение - может быть Мерлок наконец ознакомиться с идеями левых теорией, а может он просто думает, что коммунисты - его лучшие союзники, по крайней мере на данный момент."

HEL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Объявить осадное положение"
HEL_declare_state_of_siege_desc:0 "Хотя они еще не пытались вернуть себе владения шерифа, Грайфвальд остаётся постоянной угрозой как нашей независимости, так и зарождающейся революции. Мы должны немедленно начать готовиться к неизбежному столкновению между нами и нашими старыми хозяевами."

HEL_revolutionary_central_command:0 "Хорошо организованные революционеры"
HEL_revolutionary_central_command_desc:0 "Несмотря на все споры, практика показывает, что армия, как правило, хорошо показывает себя когда она хорошо организована. Нам давно пора собрать множество парамилитаристов, по сути состоящие из кучи бандитов, контроль над которыми Вуд предоставил Дескье."

HEL_evolve_the_bandit_territory:0 "Эволюция бандитской территории"
HEL_evolve_the_bandit_territory_desc:0 "‘Бандитские организации" - это своего рода оксюморон, особенно в нашей стране. Хотя некоторый уровень оперативной свободы на низком уровне необходим для эффективных атак, суть в том, что Аделарту нужно преобразовать систему во что-то более надёжное; это должно более чем удовлетворить эмигрантов."

HEL_the_outlaw_in_chief:0 "Eint Veralt ènd' alt Veur Eint"
HEL_the_outlaw_in_chief_desc:0 "Позволить эмигрантам делать всё, что они захотят, было бы ошибкой. Хотя ему и не нравится это признавать, Вуд был грифоном, объединившим Аделарт против его врагов, и отсутствие централизованного руководства привело бы только к хаосу. Он сохранит свои полномочия, и напомнит каждому существу о своей власти."

HEL_the_merrygriffs_shall_fly_eternal:0 "Вечная свобода"
HEL_the_merrygriffs_shall_fly_eternal_desc:0 "Авангардисты - это просто шерифы в красном. Их идеал централизованного государства - это именно то, что создало нынешние условия в Аделарте, и таким нелепым представлениям здесь не место. Мы полностью отклонили петицию Дескье и не намерены прислушиваться к её опасному авторитарному идеализму."

HEL_free_armies_of_a_free_territory:0 "Свободные армии для свободной территории"
HEL_free_armies_of_a_free_territory_desc:0 "Хотя, возможно, каждый житель Аделарта имеет право объединиться в ополчение, если он того пожелает, авангардисты оказались проблемой. Конечно, они не будут наказаны за свои убеждения, просто вместо этого мы предложим им выбор: покинуть свои организации или вступить в наши бандитские бригады, где их политические пристрастия будут сведены на нет."

HEL_the_flowenan_petition:0 "Петиция фловенца"
HEL_the_flowenan_petition_desc:0 "Жауме де Конар - любопытный персонаж. Он, пожалуй, единственный фловенец, заинтересованный в Аделарте, и всё же он кажется не более диковинным, чем обычный бизнесмен из этого печального города банков. Он и его инвесторы довольно странные грифоны; но если де Конар может принести пользу нашему маленькому государству, то, возможно, Вуду стоит его выслушать."

HEL_of_bankers_and_bandits:0 "О банкирах и бандитах"
HEL_of_bankers_and_bandits_desc:0 "Мы не промышленники и, по правде говоря, не очень хорошо разбираемся в механизмах в целом. Поэтому неудивительно, что - каким бы странным ни было их предложение - де Конару и его партнерам было разрешено руководить экономическим развитием Аделартом. Вуд, конечно же, выделил несколько бандитских формирований для защиты активов Жаума, а также для того, чтобы следит за фловенцем."

HEL_grovel_for_loans:0 "Новые кредиты"
HEL_grovel_for_loans_desc:0 "До самого недавнего времени Фловена довольно неохотно одалживала нашему отсталому государству какую-либо значительную сумму денег. Приезд Де Конара сюда закономерно вызвал новый интерес со стороны тамошних банков. Скорее всего они просто знают, что в Аделарте теперь есть надёжный грифон, которому они могут довериться и вложить свои средства."

HEL_sell_the_collectives:0 "Сладкие, сладкие нефтедоллары"
HEL_sell_the_collectives_desc:0 "И вот всё готово. Ну, мы не то чтобы пытались это скрыть, но большинство в Аделарте даже не знают, насколько ценна нефть на самом деле. Тем не менее, Вуд не удивлён - иначе зачем бы чрезвычайно богатому промышленнику из Фловены интересоваться таким захолустьем, как Аделарт, если бы там не было возможности получить прибыль? Так что пусть нефть течёт рекой!"

HEL_good_ol_gun_running:0 "Старая добрая торговля оружием"
HEL_good_ol_gun_running_desc:0 "Некоторые неодобрительно относятся к торговле оружием, но на самом деле подобным занимается большинство стран на континенте. Хитрость в том, чтобы убедиться, что монополия принадлежит именно вам, чтобы оружие не попало в лапы ваших врагов. В конце концов, преступность вредна для бизнеса. Только если вы не босс банды, конечно же."

HEL_crack_open_revolutionary_stores:0 "Открыть революционные магазины"
HEL_crack_open_revolutionary_stores_desc:0 "Хотя к настоящему времени они сильно запылились и устарели, некоторые реликвии войны за независимость всё ещё лежат на складах или в стратегически расположенных тайниках по всей стране. Это плохие пушки, но сейчас они будут служить нам так же хорошо, как лет десять назад. Если, конечно, мы будем держать их в хорошем состоянии; хотя у бандитов с этим будут проблемы."

HEL_community_armouries:0 "Общественные арсеналы"
HEL_community_armouries_desc:0 "Хотя эти оружейные и не самые чистые или эффективные производственные мощности, важно то, что они принадлежат нам и что они работают. Нам не нужны высокомерные банкиры из Фловены, и, клянусь Бореем, они будут держать свои жадные когти подальше от нашей постепенно формирующейся индустрии!"

HEL_keep_the_foundations_strong:0 "О революционных основах"
HEL_keep_the_foundations_strong_desc:0 "Очевидно, что банкиры замышляют что-то недоброе. Фловенцы никогда не покидают свой позолоченный город, если не хотят что-то скупить, и Вуд был прав, отклонив их петицию. Скатертью дорога де Конару, и пусть его богатство иссякнет за попытку захватить власть в нашей стране."

HEL_disarm_dispossess_distribute:0 "Экономика преступников"
HEL_disarm_dispossess_distribute_desc:0 "Хотя мы, жители Аделарта, благородный народ, нам не привыкать брать то, что нужно, силой. Именно Вуд популяризировал практику брать у богатых и раздавать бедным, а наши соседи, честно говоря, действительно очень зажиточные. Мы уверены, что они простят нам эти набеги... рано или поздно."

HEL_reprise_individuelle:0 "Исправить несправедливость"
HEL_reprise_individuelle_desc:0 "Рейдерство - фундаментальная часть нашей философии. Это может причинить боль некоторым существам, но те, у кого мы отнимаем, заслуживают того, чтобы их имущество было захвачено. В конечном счёте, наша деятельность призвана приносить моральные и экономические блага бедным, вот почему мы должны продолжать делать то, что делаем. Позвольте нам освободить вас от ваших чрезмерных излишеств!"

HEL_the_prelates_petition:0 "Просьба прелата"
HEL_the_prelates_petition_desc:0 "Самозваный прелат Аделарта довольно эгоцентричен, но, тем не менее, у него есть значительное количество последователей, с которыми шутки плохи. Они непоколебимы в своих убеждениях - по крайней мере, на данный момент, - и нам было бы неплохо услышать, что скажет Лука Лиссейский, даже если в его прошении содержится огромное количество претенциозной болтовни."

HEL_revoke_the_privileges:0 "Приостановить их привилегии"
HEL_revoke_the_privileges_desc:0 "Церковь - как и любой институт централизованной власти - это не более чем катастрофа, ожидающая своего часа. Мы не будем наказывать приверженцев веры, поскольку для этого нет причин, но мы не станем исполнять требования Луки Лиссейского и лишим его власти. Влияние этого грифона представляет опасность для его последователей и для любого другого существа в Аделарте."

HEL_revolutionary_pilgrimage:0 "На встречу народу"
HEL_revolutionary_pilgrimage_desc:0 "Хотя прелат был смещён со своего поста, его последователи по-прежнему представляют угрозу и нуждаются в нейтрализации. Не силой, конечно, а альтернативными формами обращения в свою веру. Социалисты, возможно, имеют в своих рядах больше опасных сторонников, но они не так ненавидят Вуда, как последователи Луки. Так что пусть авангардисты повеселятся."

HEL_voice_for_all_malice_toward_none:0 "Услышим всех, и никого не обидим"
HEL_voice_for_all_malice_toward_none_desc:0 "Хотя некоторые предложения Луки Лиссейского просто заходят слишком далеко, его петиция в целом приемлема, а его цели, по-видимому, достойны восхищения. Вуд заключил с ним соглашение, и мы будем стремиться внедрить предложенную конфедеративную систему в качестве альтернативы сильному централизованному правительству, чего, откровенно говоря, никто не хочет видеть в Аделарте."

HEL_loyal_leagues_of_green:0 "Лояльные Лиги Зелёных"
HEL_loyal_leagues_of_green_desc:0 "Хотя это может и расстроить леворадикальные группировки ополченцев, формальная мобилизация религиозных групп даст нам избыток готовых добровольцев для будущих конфликтов. Это не идеальное решение проблем с грифонскими ресурсами, но оно, безусловно, сработает в качестве временной меры."

HEL_the_free_territory_endures:0 "Mir Wëlle Bleiwe Wat mir Sinn!"
HEL_the_free_territory_endures_desc:0 "Настоящее единство среди всех жителей Аделарта появляется при вторжении очередного автократа. Захватчики пытались сделать это и раньше, и иногда им это удавалось, но никогда больше мы не будем праздно жить в подчинении у другого тирана. Мы останемся теми, кто мы есть: независимыми, сплочёнными и сильными как народ с общей историей вытеснения тех, кто стремится похоронить нашу идентичность."

HEL_bandits_priests_people:0 "Бандиты, священники, народ"
HEL_bandits_priests_people_desc:0 "Хотя пока не совсем ясно почему, Вуд решил согласиться со всеми требованиями прелата. Скоро будет сформировано правительство Луки Лиссейского, а коммунисты будут навсегда изгнаны из Аделарта и отправлены обратно на промозглые улицы Аквилеи, где им и место."

HEL_embrace_the_old_prelature:0 "Законное место прелата"
HEL_embrace_the_old_prelature_desc:0 "Хотя для многих это стало разочарованием, стало ясно, что Лука Лиссейский вынужден стать союзником Вуда и управлять Аделартом вместе с ним. Без сомнения, некоторые будут протестовать против такого значительного увеличения власти церкви, но это необходимо для блага верующих и Аделарта в целом."

HEL_head_of_the_snake:0 "Голова змеи"
HEL_head_of_the_snake_desc:0 "Когда мы завоевали независимость от Грайфвальда, нам так и не удалось найти шерифа. Ему удалось ускользнуть от нас, и скорее всего, он будет пытаться вернуть власть, как только предоставится нужный момент. На этот раз ему не сбежать. Теперь мы будем охотиться до тех пор, пока его башка не будет торчать на копье за все непростительные преступления."

### THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARMY TREE ###

HEL_the_six_companies:0 "Шесть вольных армий"
HEL_the_six_companies_desc:0 "Шесть вольных армий, различные банды наёмников, частные военные компании, священные ордена и организации революционеров, основанные на различных этапах истории Аделарта, составляют костяк всех контингентов, не находящихся под непосредственным руководством персональной армии лидера страны. Чтобы вернуть воорйжённым силам страны надлежащее положение, мы должны разобраться с ними и выяснить, кого из них стоит поддержать... а кто слишком ненадёжен."

HEL_the_fliger_air_corps:0 "Семейный авиационный корпус Алоиса и Джоанны Флигер"
HEL_the_fliger_air_corps_desc:0 "Воздушный корпус Флигеров, основанный в 981 году П.И.Л., представляет собой группу пилотов Фетизии, изгнанных из страны за контрабанду на чёрном рынке Фловены. Ради выгоды, любопытства или от беспомощности они решили остаться в Аделарте, и являются единственными местными ВВС, а это значит, что для контроля своего воздушного пространства нам нужно договориться с их огромной семьей."

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine:0 "Настоящая воздушная доктрина"
HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "Нет смысла заниматься аэродромами или самолётами, если мы не знаем, как их использовать. Таким образом, построив необходимую инфраструктуру и запустив в производство первые подобия летательных аппаратов в Аделарте, мы также сразу установим воздушную доктрину своих ВВС."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Поглотить ополченцев"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "Хотя наша армия так и будет децентрализованной, мы всё же должны обеспечить контроль армии над всеми ополченцами Аделарта. Поэтому будет начата новая кампания по интеграции местных группировок парамилитаристов. Разумеется, мы сохраним большую часть их автономии."

#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Интегрировать сестёр Эйр"
#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "Сестры Эйр - довольно... эксцентричная группа. Разъезжая по Аделарту на своих железных чудовищах, они исполняют волю богов на земле. Мы должны приложить усилия, чтобы попытаться интегрировать их в свою армию, и использовать их божественную силу в своих интересах."

HEL_the_merrimane_column:0 "Колонна Мерримана"
HEL_the_merrimane_column_desc:0 "Колонна Мерримана, собрание интернациональных социалистов-революционеров из Эквестрии и ветеранов левого крыла Первой Аквелийской Революции, обосновалась в Аделарте во время местной революции в 987 году П.И.Л. С тех пор они завоевали репутацию центра воинствующих левых и базы, где волонтеры со всего мира помогают строить новый Аделарт."

HEL_haven_of_socialism:0 "Пристанище глобального социализма"
HEL_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "В то время как большинство отвергло бы идею предоставления безопасного проезда и жилья социалистам-революционерам со всего мира, у нас нет причин бояться этих единомышленников. [HEL.GetNameDefCap] будет надёжным убежищем и центром операций для наших красных друзей по всему континенту и за его пределами!"

HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models:0 "Сталлионградские модели танков"
HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models_desc:0 "Революционеры Сталлионграда были первыми, кто разработал эффективные танки, и уже много лет экспортируют свои разработки в социалистические страны. Нам было бы неплохо перенять эти знания и изучить эти чертежи самим, чтобы диверсифицировать свои вооружённые силы и оказывать бронетанковую поддержку как нашим ополченцам, так и основной армии."

HEL_army_of_aggression:0 "Армия агрессии"
HEL_army_of_aggression_desc:0 "Есть древний анекдот, относящийся к эпохе Гровера II, в котором этот грифон утверждает, что нападение - лучшая защита, а затем погибает в безрассудной атаке на хорошо подготовленного врага. Однако в словах бедняги был смысл. Правильное применение наступательной тактики и высокий уровень автономии среди командиров часто приводят к стратегическому успеху."

HEL_adelartian_international_brigades:0 "Сформировать новые интернациональные бригады"
HEL_adelartian_international_brigades_desc:0 "Помимо того, что так мы приобретём военный опыт и обучим свои вооружённые силы без обширных и дорогостоящих тренировок, огромная сеть иностранных добровольцев даст ещё одно преимущество. Когда мы пойдём в поход на Аделарт, страна также получит множество существ готовых взяться за оружие, чтобы защитить свой любимый центр революции."

HEL_to_the_barricades:0 "Chantons la Liberté, Défendons la Cite"
HEL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "Поскольку многие революционеры - горожане, умевшие читать с юных лет, неудивительно, что они лучше ориентируются в городах, чем большинство призывников. На первый взгляд эта особенность может показаться несущественной, но детальное знание местности способствует лучшему позиционированию и превосходному ведению городских боёв, которые могут оказаться жизненно важными для нашей победы."

HEL_the_jade_company:0 "Нефритовая компания Ромау"
HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 ""Нефритовая компания", появившаяся в 911 году ПИЛ, во главе которой стоял сенатор-диссидент из Ромау, не имеет по-настоящему централизованного управления после смерти старого грифона, основавшего её, но это компенсируется фанатичной преданностью делу республиканцев. У неё много солдат и большое влияние, и хотя они слишком жестоки в своей борьбе с монархистами, если мы заручимся поддержкой этих наёмников, они будут нам абсолютно преданы."

HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires:0 "Упорство легионеров"
HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires_desc:0 "Рыцари Ромау славятся не зря. Они могут отстаивать принципы, которые в значительной степени чужды нам, но, тем не менее, их способность воевать замечательна. Нам было бы неплохо скопировать их традиции широкого военного планирования на стратегическом уровне в сочетании со строгой подготовкой отдельных солдат и командиров."

HEL_renew_and_revive:0 "Обновлять, возрождать, пополнять"
HEL_renew_and_revive_desc:0 "Сами по себе грифоны - не единственная часть армии, которую нужно готовить к войне. Оборудование, будь оно сложным или простым, в равной степени требует технического обслуживания и улучшений. Поддержание нашего оружия в рабочем состоянии окажет большую помощь нашему военному производству в долгосрочной перспективе, даже если отремонтированное вооружение в конечном итоге устареет.

# FIRST PATH - the VANGUARD #

### Alexandra Desiceux and her emigres, vanguardists, and pro-Aquileian communist bloc has taken control of Adelart, and essentially done a 180 on revolutionary development, transforming a state of bandit anarchy under an uneasy confederation into a would-be worker's republic. Fiercely critical of the old bandits and militias, the faith, and reactionaries, the Vanguardists are very much patronising of the average Adelartian, who they view as needing a lot of uplifting from a primitive nationalist philosophy and the opiate of religion. Still, there is much potential here for true class consciousness, and there is an element of idealism and visionary politics among the emigre's experiments in Adelart.

HEL_defenders_of_the_revolution:0 "Gardes Rouges de la Forêt"
HEL_defenders_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Originating as an intelligence outcropping of Wood’s bandit operations, the Gardes Rouges de la Forêt have long since pledged their allegiance to our cause. Their skills have evolved over the years from simple woodland espionage into a full-blown intelligence organisation, one that we can now attach to the state in an official capacity."

HEL_eradicate_the_old_believers:0 "Eradicate the Old Believers"
HEL_eradicate_the_old_believers_desc:0 "Though they claim their intentions to be noble, the Old Believers are a threat to the proliferation of the revolution and Desiceux’s authority.

HEL_begin_the_anti_anarchist_platform_desc:0 "What some in Adelart do not know, it seems, is the basic principles on which this world governs and upon which revolutionary policy is ought to have been based on.

HEL_bolster_the_intellectuals:0 "A Revolutionary Intelligentsia"
HEL_bolster_the_intellectuals_desc:0 "Whilst some socialists may turn up their beaks at the idea that an intelligentsia can or even should exist within a marksist society, the reality of our situation necessitates some irregularities in doctrine.

HEL_urban_economics_start:0 "Adelart and the Future"
HEL_urban_economics_start_desc:0 "Rapid economic development is tricky when your population lacks a significantly sized middle class that can invest in new technologies, but it is not impossible.

HEL_expand_public_schooling_desc:0 "State schooling is such a necessity in the modern era that many non-communist regimes have already adopted the practice to varying extents.

HEL_a_unique_advantage:0 "A Unique Advantage"
HEL_a_unique_advantage_desc:0 "Adelart sits upon one of the largest inland oil deposits in Griffonia, granting us access to an economically and strategically valuable resource that many of our neighbours sorely lack.

HEL_nationalized_oil:0 "Take Control of the Reserves"
HEL_nationalized_oil_desc:0 "With our resource-rich land fully developed, we can now cement our loose claw-hold over the industries.

Our reserves shall fuel the revolution and never line the pockets of paper pushers!"

HEL_fuel_our_future:0 "Fuel Our Future"
HEL_fuel_our_future_desc:0 "A modern war is ultimately a war of resources.

HEL_cut_a_swathe_through_the_forests_desc:0 "Though it is a shame to sully Adelart’s stunning natural beauty, the immense woodlands of the region ultimately limit the available space for industrial development.

HEL_a_five_year_plan:0 "Hyper-industrialization"
HEL_a_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Given the state of poor old Adelart, anyone could be forgiven for assuming our industrial project would fail miserably; but we have turned the country into an economic powerhouse in spite of the many problems that we faced. Descieux has succeeded in her project of rapid yet well-regulated industrial expansion to a degree never before seen, exceeding even the example set by Stalliongrad."

###SECOND POLITICAL PATH - ANARCHISTS###

### Having succeeded in establishing complete primacy over Adelart for him and his bandit confederation, Merlock Wood has embraced the logical conclusions of the principles of the confederation, of autonomy, of decentralization, and of liberty for all griffons - anarchy. Transforming Adelart's anarchy from circumstance into ideology, Wood will seek to promote free association under a autonomous military apparatus that will guide Adelart to the future, and commit a bit too much violence on reactionaries, the temples, foreign powers, and perhaps even some of its own populace. Launching insurrectionary campaigns to take from the rich and give to the poor, this path largely retains the "Robin Hood" vibe.

### THIRD PATH - THE PRELATURE OF ADELART ###

### The Prelate and his steel-plated tractors and steel-plated knights have taken control of the country, pledging to restore the true practices of the Old Believers and reject any sort of hierarchical religion. Fiercely independent and quite militaristic despite a pacifistic, communitarian, and cooperative ethos, the Prelate's supporters have essentially declared war on the Archonate and the false kings and dukes of Griffonia who claim divine right. The only person with divine right, they say, is the Prophet of Eyr - a mysterious griffon from the Adelartian forests known simply as Luca vun Lissay. Soft-spoken yet with deep reservoirs of passionate sermons, Luca and his militias have a clear ethos - but may follow some cult-like practices in their desire to restore some pretty chill and courageous religious values.

HEL_social_conservatives:0 "The Prelate Leads the Coalition"
HEL_social_conservatives_desc:0 "The Conservative Eyrite backed faction has won out in the elections. Still believing in many of the liberal republican ideas of the other factions, they will go about their policy with the religious undertones of the old believers."

HEL_a_better_figurehead:0 "Recall Merlock Wood"
HEL_a_better_figurehead_desc:0 "Merlock Wood is a hero to our people, despite his connections to the socialists. While we cannot persecute him for his political escapades, we can recall him from service and grant him a hero's retirement; effectively removing him from any real power."

HEL_social_funds:0 "A Social Fund"
HEL_social_funds_desc:0 "The church's charity can only go so far. A Social Fund must be set up for our poorer communities that are suffering in this time of change. Well-timed and modest grants will empower local entities to solve their own problems effectively at the ground level."

HEL_eyrian_charity:0 "Bread, Rice, and Idols"
HEL_eyrian_charity_desc:0 "We cannot afford to forget our most destitute in these trying times. The church shall use its vast influence in Adelart to provide charity to those in need, all of which will be subsidized and supported by the current administration."

HEL_encourage_large_families:0 "Eyrite Family Laws"
HEL_encourage_large_families_desc:0 "It is only in recent years that Adelart has passed a million griffons in its territory. As our standard of living inscreases, our birthrate goes down. Therefore, we must make it appealing and beneficial to have a large family by offering subsidies and tax cuts."

HEL_agrarianism_focus:0 "Safeguard Rural Traditionalism"
HEL_agrarianism_focus_desc:0 "The majority of our population may reside in urban centers, but the true heart of Adelart is found outside of the cities. We must appeal to these rural masses for support. By changing the way that votes are weighed by county we can grant them a louder voice in government."

HEL_subsidize_the_farms:0 "Peasants into Farmers"
HEL_subsidize_the_farms_desc:0 "It is time that we return to our roots, quite literally.

We must modernize our farms and give our farmers the tools to grow past their peasant pastures."

HEL_eyrite_values:0 "Temperance, Diligence, Community"
HEL_eyrite_values_desc:0 "In an effort to curb poverty and properly commit to our promises of direct democracy, our government shall make initiatives to form local citizen's councils.

### Confederation Foreign Policy ####

HEL_confederal_foreign_policy:0 "The Aquileian Confederation of Cantons"
HEL_confederal_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Though it was not our intention, much of Aquileia has come under our direct control as a consequence of their attempted invasion. Rather than establish a puppet government, it has been decided that the system of cantons shall be expanded to include all Aquiliea; giving our fellow griffs another chance to experience democracy and freedom."

HEL_move_against_greifwald:0 "Liberate the Vassals"
HEL_move_against_greifwald_desc:0 "For most of history, Vinovia, Rila and Westkeep have been subject to the wants and needs of the presiding government in Aquila with little say over their own affairs. Once their currently ruling regimes are put to rest, their people will welcome the canton system with open foreclaws."

HEL_alliance_with_pomovarra:0 "Alliance with Pomovarra"
HEL_alliance_with_pomovarra_desc:0 "Pomovarra remains one of the last remnants of regional republican democracy in the Periphery and indeed, all of Griffonia. [POM.GetLeader] has forged democracy from the ashes of the Aquileian collapse, just as we have. We must ally with them and eventually pursue unification under a common language and culture, or both of our nations will enter the dustbin of history."

HEL_invite_avian:0 "Avian in the Pact"
HEL_invite_avian_desc:0 "Avian has endured a history of rule from Griffenheim and - unsurprisingly - does not wish to now be ruled from Aquila. We do believe that they would be interested in an alliance however, and as such we shall offer them a position in the pact for strategic defence against the enemies of peace on Griffonia."

HEL_invite_flowena:0 "Protection for Flowena"
HEL_invite_flowena_desc:0 "Though Flowena is wealthy, its practices of hiring mercenaries to defend itself are not sufficient protection in the modern age of immense militaries and even larger industries. Without help, the city would be put to siege and obliterated by any foe willing to wait. In the hopes of avoiding such a situation, we will offer them a position in the pact."

HEL_propose_pomovarran_unification:0 "Propose Pomovarran Unification"
HEL_propose_pomovarran_unification_desc:0 "Adelart and Pomovarra have long held cultural ties to one another, ties that have only grown stronger as time passes. Now that we have inherited the role of the region’s largest political entity, it is only sensical that we offer Pomovarra cantonhood within our confederation; retaining autonomy and joining their brothers in arms."

HEL_unified_democratic_government:0 "The Plea for Legitimacy"
HEL_unified_democratic_government_desc:0 "Though we have militarily conquered Aquileia, our new government lacks the recognition that their centuries-old political order did. To ensure that we maintain a beneficial amount of international legitimacy in the years to come, we must make an effort to place ourselves as the rightful successor of the now defunct Aquileian state."

HEL_curtail_estates:0 "Crush the Estates"
HEL_curtail_estates_desc:0 "Landowners have held immense sway over the functioning of Aquileian governments for centuries, causing immense discontent amongst the less privileged.

HEL_expand_self_management:0 "Expand Self-Management"
HEL_expand_self_management_desc:0 "Unions exist in a unique situation, simultaneously without direct representation in the government and yet able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of griffons in protest when necessary. In order to smooth over negotiations and increase productivity, we will grant official unions the right to organise their own workplaces within the bounds of other regulatory statutes."

HEL_union_political_machine:0 "Unionized, Urban Political Machines"
HEL_union_political_machine_desc:0 "Though unions are commonplace, the government still has the ability to ignore their demands if they consider it absolutely necessary. Whilst in times of war this may be acceptable, in all other circumstances it is disgraceful. The canton’s creatures are to be heard and the city unions will make sure the government listens."

HEL_democratic_cult_of_personality:0 "Hero Of Our New Democracy"
HEL_democratic_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Though he doesn’t like to admit it, Merlock Wood was the first amongst us to recognise the need for socialist progress in moderation. From the rich to the poor, the voices of the many before the voices of the few. His ideals are responsible for the construction of the cantons in all and - make a fuss of being hailed as a hero as he may - it is a well deserved title."

HEL_recognize_prelate_ebonwing:0 "Recognize Prelate Ebonwing"
HEL_recognize_prelate_ebonwing_desc:0 "Luca vun Lissay and his puppets in the communities controlled Adelart for twenty years. Now that we control all of Greifwald's core territory, we can finally remove Luca vun Lissay without large-scale protest, and recognize Prelate Ebonwing as rightful religious leader of Greifwald, even if we continue to support secular policies on all levels of government."

HEL_expand_nationalization_programs:0 "Unified Nationalisation Progamme"
HEL_expand_nationalization_programs_desc:0 "There are many industries and elements of infrastructure that are of such importance that financing them out of the state’s budget is the best way to guarantee their longevity. Though it may frustrate those who previously owned said industries, it is the best course of action for the prosperity of the cantons."

HEL_expand_eyrite_social_programs:0 "Expand Eyrite Social Programs"
HEL_expand_eyrite_social_programs_desc:0 "Whilst our cultural roots lend us a naturally charitable outlook upon those less fortunate, current institutions provide less than we would ideally like. It is time we enshrined charity in law to create a truly social state out of our preexisting preferences."

HEL_rally_the_youth:0 "Pro-Democracy Youth Leagues"
HEL_rally_the_youth_desc:0 "In most contexts, militaristic youth groups are typically both radical and dangerous; but there are certainly ways to make them useful. If the state provides the means for such groups to operate, the groups will naturally favour the state and will struggle to survive without it. With this in mind the cantons can easily create and maintain, pro-democracy and pro-reform youth groups."

HEL_reject_distributism:0 "Remembering Boreas' Prosperity"
HEL_reject_distributism_desc:0 "Though our communal roots have not been entirely translated into the modern realities of governance and capitalism, we still provide for the less fortunate. Humane capitalism is necessary for the safe and stable growth of canton economies and is a reminder to even the lowliest griff that there is always hope."

HEL_a_democratic_periphery:0 "Peace in the Périphérie"
HEL_a_democratic_periphery_desc:0 "At last it is done. Though there are still foreign enemies that would see our state crumble into dust, the cantons and our allies have achieved what the empire and Aquileia never could: Peace and prosperity in the Périphérie and beyond."

HEL_strike_avi:0 "Free Avian"
HEL_strike_avi_desc:0 "The remains of the Duchy of Verenia are squabbled over by oppresive nobility like carrion over a dying cow!

HEL_strike_pyt:0 "Attack Greifenmarschen"
HEL_strike_pyt_desc:0 "The Griffon Empire weakens with each passing day and our Herzlandish brothers to the our north are shackled by the shadow of that Empire. The "Peasant Republic" must be liberated so that we can be united together in a true democracy! For Freedom! For Adelart!"

HEL_core_pyt:0 "Integrate Greifenmarschen"
HEL_core_pyt_desc:0 "We have been successful in annexing Greifenmarschen, but we must take the time to enlighten our brothers and sisters to the true path to freedom. We will nuture the moderate parties within the former Imperial territory, while condeming the radicial facists and communists that fester there in order to bring about political unity."

HEL_strike_pom:0 "Topple the Pomovarran Plutocracy"
HEL_strike_pom_desc:0 "Our brothers and sisters in Pomovarra are not in dire straits, for they live under their enlightened oligarchs! What use is their oligarchy though? They have good rulers now, but in a few years they might turn into despots! We will strike now to give the people of Pomovarra a choice in who rules them with the power of the ballot!"

HEL_strike_flo:0 "The Vaults of Flowena"
HEL_strike_flo_desc:0 "Our business connections in Flowena have helped us nurture our young economy, but it does not take a seer to understand what Flowena does with its gold. Their oligrachs horde it away from their people, stealing it from all of Griffonia! We will liberate that city of gold and use its funds to help build our more perfect union, Eyr help us!"

HEL_agrarian_economics_start_desc:0 "The sole purpose of an economy is not for profit and modernization - it is for self-actualization and common purpose.

HEL_limited_urbanization:0 "Limited Urbanization"
HEL_limited_urbanization_desc:0 "We must carefully encourage excess agrarian workers to migrate to the cities, but we cannot blindly bring them in enmasse!

HEL_electricity_for_the_forests:0 "Electricity For The Forests"
HEL_electricity_for_the_forests_desc:0 "As we expand the electrical grid of Adelart from our cities, we must also not neglect our brothers and sisters in the forest.

HEL_gradual_industrialization:0 "Gradual Industrialization"
HEL_gradual_industrialization_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization almost always seems to lead to suffering, but it is not something to scorn either. We will take a more moderate path.

HEL_support_rural_schooling:0 "Support Rural Schooling"
HEL_support_rural_schooling_desc:0 "A child has as much to learn in the schoolhouse as they do on the farm. We will offer better pay for rural teachers and grant more supplies to their schools in hopes of improving the academic standards outside of the cities."

HEL_continue_land_reform:0 "Continue Land Reform"
HEL_continue_land_reform_desc:0 "To think that land reform itself will bring about an equitable system? That is misguided. To deny the power of reform though? That is foolish.

HEL_encourage_arts_and_theatre:0 "Promote The Arts"
HEL_encourage_arts_and_theatre_desc:0 "A society's culture is its voice and its legacy, so we will ensure that our arts will be supported with copious grants dedicated to them. Adelart, in a few years, will be known as a rich center of the arts with its own unique culture!"

HEL_support_workers_self_management:0 "A Say For Every Worker"

HEL_oil_agrarian:0 "Dig Shallow And Carefully"

We listen to our scientists, oil is a finite resource. We will extract it at a measured pace to bolster our economy, but not make our economy reliant upon it."


### FIFTH POLITICAL PATH - OIL REPUBLIC ###

### The Oil Republic is led by Jaume de Conard, yet the Flowenan-backed industrialist and all-around slimy, charismatic personality can come to power through two ways, and must carefully balance both of them. First is democratic legitimacy, needed to placate the people - his government after all, is technically a republic of the people, the fulfilling of Adelart's true mission of democracy and self-determination, to be led away from these socialist bandits and toward a new reppublican era. The Second is loyalty to his benefactors, the Flowenans, and the maintenance of their interests - control of Adelart's oil fields, friends in government, and proper industrialization. From this, the Oil Republic - a oligarchic apparatus dedicated to profit and power, yet with a shred of proper democracy and state-building regardless ( perhaps the most stable democracy out of any path ), is born.

HEL_de_conards_republic:0 "The Oil Republic"
HEL_de_conards_republic_desc:0 "Whether by trickery or legitimate democratic means, Jaume de Conard has found himself at the helm of a new Adelartian Republic.

HEL_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Let the World Know Our Name"

HEL_the_flowenan_group:0 "Full Control for de Conard"
HEL_the_flowenan_group_desc:0 "Contrary to the beliefs of some, a republic is not precluded from enjoying the benefits of authoritarianism.

HEL_oil_attack_greifwald_desc:0 "Despite our veiled intentions with this republican project, it is important that we maintain some semblance of ideological consistency for the sake of our national legitimacy.

HEL_drive_out_the_bandits:0 "Tanks Through the Forests"
HEL_drive_out_the_bandits_desc:0 "To be frank, nogriff knows what’s going on in Griefwald. We dealt with them and made sure that we were the preeminent authority in the region, even borrowing their name for a little while; but in the end very few creatures actually made investments there and truly cleaned up the place. It’s high time we cleaned out those forests for good."

HEL_oil_oil_and_more_oil_desc:0 "The great thing about oil is that everyone wants it, and that we’re the ones who can give it to them; for a price of course.

So it is in economics, so it shall be in wider Aquileian society."

HEL_the_preemptive_strike:0 "The Preemptive Strike"
HEL_the_preemptive_strike_desc:0 "Pomovarra is everything we claim to be, yet are not. Their social democracy is a threat to our facade, however thick the veil we use may be. They will need to be dealt with. Market competitors are one thing, but an ideological threat that undermines the legitimacy of our establishments? Well, that simply won't do."

HEL_full_alliance_with_flowena_desc:0 "Whilst international economic agreements rarely extend so far as to warrant military cooperation, there are situations in which financial interests coincide with defensive ones.

HEL_a_republic_in_avian:0 "A Republic in Avian"
HEL_a_republic_in_avian_desc:0 "Much like the Périphérie, Avian is a hotbed of violence and is - to be blunt - an economic black hole in every respect. The region may be marginally more developed than Adelart once was, but it is no less chaotic. The republic - true to its moral duties in ensuring peace and stability - shall make a significant military investment in the region."

Not only do they threaten our financial existence, but their open approach to the way their state is run has led to many griffs questioning our finances and de Conard’s personal wealth. Their end is nigh."

HEL_integrate_greifwalder_institutions:0 "The Pan-Aquileian Parliament"

HEL_align_republic:0 "The True Aquileian Republic"
HEL_align_republic_desc:0 "The previous attempts at republican revolution were marred and eventually entirely halted by their aggressive anti-monarchy tendencies.

HEL_the_sheriffs_adelart_desc:0 "For two decades Adelart has languished in the claws of bandits and traitors, but no longer. The old order reigns once more and it has no ears for the enemies of the sheriff; let us remind the locals what happens to those that oppose Griefwald and its paramount interests."

HEL_resume_the_anti_banditry_campaign:0 "Resume the Crackdowns"
HEL_resume_the_anti_banditry_campaign_desc:0 "The sheriff once more assuming control over Adelart has not been taken lightly by the locals and many resist his rightful rule. What those fools fail to realise is that fighting back gives us an opportunity to put them in their place. We shall not rest until every single traitor is captured or killed, no exceptions."

HEL_anarchists_are_bandits:0 "Anarchists Are Bandits"
HEL_anarchists_are_bandits_desc:0 "The anarchists are just that, the enemies of order and progress. Not only did they assist in overthrowing the sheriff in 987, but they have aligned themselves with wood and a fundamentally dangerous ideology. They are little more than an enemy to be crushed, and crushed these bandits shall be."

HEL_liberals_are_bandits:0 "Liberals Are Bandits"
HEL_liberals_are_bandits_desc:0 "De Conard and the confederalists - though not aligned - are deplorable for similar reasons. Both resent the idea of monarchy, both seek money above all else and both will cause Adelart’s untimely demise if left unattended for much longer. They too shall be hunted down like the bandit scum that they pretend to be above."

HEL_old_believers_are_bandits:0 "Old Believers Are Bandits"
HEL_old_believers_are_bandits_desc:0 "The old believers are little more than a cult and an affront to both the sheriff and the primary tenets of tritheism. Eyr may be a god, but Boreas is the first amongst them; what shameless reprobates would dare to claim otherwise? If they are so keen to abandon the true teachings of the gods, then we shall send these bandits to them post-haste."

HEL_none_of_you_are_free_from_banditry:0 "None of You Are Free From Banditry"
HEL_none_of_you_are_free_from_banditry_desc:0 "Part of the banditry problem lies within the populace. Like it or not, they enabled the revolt against the sheriff to succeed in 987 either through inaction or directly supporting the bandits. That makes them no better than Wood and his despicable cronies. We shall make an example of those that try to shelter the traitors, and then there will be peace."

HEL_rally_the_monarchists:0 "Rally the Diaspora"
HEL_rally_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Despite their claims to fight for the good of Adelart, the bandit takeover forced many an administrator and rightly concerned Adelartian citizen to flee into Griefwald. Whilst they did not expect to return, the possibility of returning to a life they thought lost is very persuasive to many. Let us lay a place at the table for our old allies."

HEL_invite_the_count:0 "Invite the Count"
HEL_invite_the_count_desc:0 "The sheriff’s position is below the count and - as it is our charge - the count shall lead our nation in all of his wisdom. That is to say nothing about how much control over policy he will have, of course. We have not forgotten the lack of aid provided by the Griefwaldians and the count, so his position shall be restored in name only; as is deserving of one that fails his subjects."

HEL_avenge_the_count:0 "Avenge the Count"
HEL_avenge_the_count_desc:0 "Despite his many failings, particularly regarding the 987 revolution and the lack of resources that were provided to prevent it, the count was nevertheless our leader. He was taken from us - like Adelart - by bandits, thieves and anarchists. We shall avenge the heartless killing of the count and make examples of the griffons that dare oppose the sheriff."

HEL_hire_monarchist_mercenaries:0 "Стражи Грайфвальда"
HEL_hire_monarchist_mercenaries_desc:0 "Much like the previously present administrators from Griefwald, there are many officers and elite troops that were forced out of the province when Wood’s revolution regrettably succeeded. It is high time they returned to fulfil their vows to the count and to the sheriff, to reclaim Adelart from the clutches of degenerate banditry."

HEL_war_of_liberation:0 "No More Bandits in Greifwald!"
HEL_war_of_liberation_desc:0 "Ah... Sweet victory. It took two almost three decades, but the bandits and their malignant supporters have finally been rooted out and destroyed; never again to sully our model province. Peace, stability and the rule of law have returned to the Périphérie in earnest; albeit at a cost."

HEL_reopen_our_economy:0 "Our Resources for the World" 
HEL_reopen_our_economy_desc:0 "Although there are many abroad who would wish to see Adelart back under banditry, we must not shut ourselves in. There are those who simply wish to buy what we drag from the ground, and why shouldn’t we sell it to them? Idols make the world go round, after all."

HEL_our_resources_for_ourselves:0 "Our Resources for Ourselves" 
HEL_our_resources_for_ourselves_desc:0 "Our lands may be rich but they remain relatively untouched due to mismanagement, beliefs and fear. With the Sheriff back in charge we should be able to start making use of the rich patches of land we’ve left alone for so long."

HEL_profits_from_the_churches:0 "A Fortune In Black Gold" 
HEL_profits_from_the_churches_desc:0 "What Griefwald lacks in stability, friends and idols it more than makes up for with vast amounts of oil. To ensure our continued survival we need to extract as much from our fields as possible and research how to produce oil synthetically to vastly expand production for our customers."

HEL_a_capitalist_education:0 "Teach the Rabble Their Place" 
HEL_a_capitalist_education_desc:0 "If there’s one thing to be learned from Merlock’s antics its that the masses are easily sold on petty ideals and false promises.

HEL_urbanize_the_backwaters:0 "Bring Civilization to the Peasants" 
HEL_urbanize_the_backwaters_desc:0 "There is no denying the impressive advances of those around us, their cities are lined with the efforts of thousands and their inhabitants move efficiently enough to prove it.

HEL_scientific_development:0 "Greifwaldian Scholars, Adelartian Systems" 
HEL_scientific_development_desc:0 "Many within Griefwald showed a keen interest in scientific development but were unable to attempt their ideas given the limiting systems in place. With a more experimental system in place, alongside some good words from the Sheriff they may be of great use to us."

HEL_the_loyalist:0 "A New Feudalism" 
HEL_the_loyalist_desc:0 "Griffonia has moved away from it’s core tenets far too much. There was once a natural order that this new age of Republicanism and Socialism has so clearly violated. We shall strive to achieve this natural order once more, by shunning the luxuries of the present and returning once more to how Griffonia must be."

HEL_oaths_of_loyalty:0 "Take Over the Communes" 
HEL_oaths_of_loyalty_desc:0 "How polite of the communists to collect vital industry and the griffons to run it together for us before we had a chance to deal with them. I’m sure they won’t mind us ‘repurposing’ them for future use given they can’t complain anymore..."

HEL_appoint_new_nobility:0 "Reward the Old Nobility" 
HEL_appoint_new_nobility_desc:0 "There are those who, despite all the odds, still stood strong in Adelart throughout the chaos of the last two decades. Such tenacity is to be applauded and rewarded with a place in our new government to help prevent such anarchy from befalling us once more."

HEL_focus_on_urbanization:0 "Cut A Swath Through the Green Glades" 
HEL_focus_on_urbanization_desc:0 "Though our forests are beautiful they have given us nothing but problems, from preventing industrialisation to keeping bandits sheltered from us. If Greifwald is to live on it must do so with far less forests and far more factories to facilitate our growth and progress."

HEL_hike_the_taxes:0 "Arm the Tax Collectors" 
HEL_hike_the_taxes_desc:0 "To expect the populace to understand our demands peacefully is a fool's errand, such is a lesson we’ve learned too many times. The best language they know is force so we need to know how to speak it when they begin squawking. Ensuring our tax collectors are armed would be a simple way to ensure our demands are met."

HEL_consolidate_the_land:0 "A Careful "Redistribution"" 
HEL_consolidate_the_land_desc:0 "Those who have managed our limited industry and infrastructure up until now have been judged and found wanting. By sending a few threats and convincing them to ‘willingly’ give up their lands to the Sheriff we shall have far more control over what we produce and where, given that the right griffons are now in charge."

HEL_economic_rebirth:0 "Oiling the Gears of the Shrievalty" 
HEL_economic_rebirth_desc:0 "With the new inventions around us oil has become second only to idols in fueling greed all across Griffonia. Luckily we’ve found that the oil fields we believed to be moderately sized were far larger than we initially thought. With a few pretty smiles and modern equipment we can begin selling the excess far and wide."

HEL_blood_sweat_and_results:0 "The Very Structures of Serfdom" 
HEL_blood_sweat_and_results_desc:0 "Finally our efforts have borne fruit. We have managed to achieve so much more than simply turning back the clock, I daresay we’ve even surpassed what the empires of yore were able to achieve with their serfs in terms of efficiency. It's the perfect synthesis of old and new as our toilers break their backs, our cities shine clean and our factories churn out more than we could dream of!"

adelart.1.t:0 "Двадцать дней празднования" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.1.d:0 "Двадцать лет свободы требовали двадцати дней празднования для свободных весёлых грифонов Аделарта. Все недоверчивые планировщики такого грандиозного события были быстро успокоены очаровательным национальным героем Аделарта – единственным и неповторимым Мерлоком Вудом! – и вскоре улицы и площади Бергелуна наполнились празднеством. Грифонам по всей стране не терпелось присоединиться к этим грандиозным празднествам, и двадцать дней подряд столица была переполнена развевающимися партийными знаменами, вкусной едой, прекрасными мелодиями менестрелей, радостными возгласами и напитками повсюду. Для крестьян, местных героев и всех остальных двадцать лет свободы от тирании Грайфвальда были самым величайшим событием в жизни.\n\nОднако среди множества празднующих было столько же общественных лидеров, приехавших в город со всей страны, прибывших сюда не столько ради празднований, сколько представления своих сообществ в ассамблее конгресса Аделарта. За дверями открытого для всех импровизированного зала, ранее использовавшегося в качестве суда несправедливости Грайфвальда, политики и представители весьма необычных фракций собирались в течение 20 дней, чтобы обсудить будущее свободной территории.\n\nКаждый житель Аделарта знал, что напряженность в отношениях с западным соседом достигла небывало высокого уровня и будет только расти, независимо от того, как сильно веселились местные. Необходимо было как можно скорее готовиться к войне, но окончательное решение оставалось за Мерлоком Вудом: живой легендой, давшей Аделарту свободу. Или, по крайней мере, так считало большинство. За последние годы со всей Грифонии сюда стеклось множество интересных личностей, и многие из них собрали делегатов или их было немного на ассамблее этого года.\n\nВсе были уверяны, что именно сегодня будет избрано будущее для Аделарта.\n\nМерлок Вуд лениво сидел, прислушиваясь к повсеместной болтовне. Поправив на голове свой зелёный байкет, живая легенда потянулся за своей пинтой и сделал глоток."

Wood, understanding either faction would give him the power to pass orders against the other, decides to assemble the delegates together for a moeeting - and fast."
adelart.2.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?!?!?"

adelart.3.t:0 "Полемика Дескье"
adelart.3.d:0 "Причудливые встречи по расписанию были не в стиле Мерлока, но ещё больше его удивили распахнувшая двери свита одетых в красное и хвастающихся винтовками партизан Мерримана. Мерлок сжал свой пистолет. — А ты очень смелая, если решилась свергнуть меня, Александра.\n\n— Мы здесь как раз для того, чтобы остановить государственный переворот, — пронзительно закричала на чистом аквилейском Дескье. В костюме, при галстуке и в строгих очках, она явно выделялась из толпы своих телохранителей. — Этот заговор зрел против тебя все эти двадцать лет — продолжила она. — Вы и ваши друзья посеяли в такую плодородную почву классовое сознание, но как только семена начали прорастать, вы решили задушить революцию, пытаясь убить их сотрудничеством с капиталистами и священниками!\n\n— Ну, что я могу сказать? — самодовольно сказал он. — Если они на мой стороне, то они на стороне Аделарта.\n\n— Они могут и обманывать тебя, — ответила социалистка. — Вы говорите о свободе для всех, но в то же время ваше молодое "я" стремилось ограничить "свободы" шерифа и его грайфвальдских лордов. Твои новообретённые "друзья" подвергли бы тебя молодого - твою более правильную версию - в шок. — она положила папку на стол Вуда. — Вот наши требования. Три пункта: во-первых, превратить сообщества Аделарта в руководимую авангардом рабочую республику; во-вторых, запретить бандитам и наёмникам пребывать в республике, поскольку они только грабят наших рабочих; и в-третьих, осуществить политику коллективизации сельского хозяйства, а также начать массовую  индустриализацию.\n\nМерлок моргнул, когда взял документ и бегло просмотрел его целиком. По крайней мере, Дескье была довольна тем, что Вуд снова проявил интерес к их видению. Однако вскоре, когда революционерке вернули бумаги, она получила ответ:"
adelart.3.a:0 "— Ну, я точно могу пообещать дальнейшую централизацию."
adelart.3.b:0 "— Вы всё это получите только в том случае, если командовать буду я."
adelart.3.c:0 "— Все эти приказы делают из тебя шерифа в красном. Выметайся."


adelart.4.t:0 "Признание прелата" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.4.d:0 "— Кажется, я был прав насчет того, что ты стареешь.\n\nМерлок оторвал взгляд от своей тарелки и увидел очень пожилого грифона, сгорбившегося перед ним, одетого в простую мантию и держащего посох для ходьбы. Любому иностранцу этот невероятно древний жрец Эйр показался бы достаточно хрупким, чтобы его можно было сбить с ног простым тычком, но все жители Аделарта очень хорошо знали легенды, окружающие Луку.\n\nМерлок улыбнулся, вспомнив, насколько правдивы были рассказы о тех, кому посчастливилось стать жертвой его посоха. — Да брось, Лука, — поприветствовал своего друга Вуд, — С возрастом я становлюсь только лучше.\n\nПрелат Лука Лиссейский усмехнулся, согласившись, — Только веря ты сможешь прожить столько же, сколько и я.\n\nМерлок усмехнулся, — Определённо, верой, а не стоя на пути твоих танков-тракторов. — Два соотечественника вспоминали старые времена, которые они провели вместе, и ещё множество приключений, кульминацией которых стала независимость Аделарта. Они говорили о своём общем прошлом, и только когда солнце уже село и все остальные грифоны разошлись, прелат, наконец, затронул тему, о которой хотел поговорить.\n\n— Мерлок, многие верующие напуганы "хождение к грифонам". Я видел, как агенты социалистов в Аделарте пытались разжечь антиклерикальные настроения, и как коммунисты планируют заговор в тени. Конечно ты считаешь, что это хорошо, когда каждого грифона можно услышать, но это не демократия: это популизм, манипуляция, чтобы лишить наших храмов независимости и подорвать государственный институт Аделарта, за который мы боролись. Нужно что-то делать, Мерлок, и как можно скорее."
adelart.4.a:0 "Прикажите изгнанникам прекратить операции в сельской местности."

adelart.5.t:0 "An Unexpected Petitioner" #Endbeats
adelart.5.d:0 "Wood sighed once he reached the back of the congress building. He nearly collapsed against the wall stained with years of misuse and reuse. It was like Maar himself possessed the griffons in the hall the moment they walked through the threshold.\n\n"Merlock Wood, the legend," a smooth, devilish voice spoke from behind. Wood spun around at the sound and put one of his claws on his flintlock. Before him stood a clean-cut, handsome griffon with a dark grey suit so clean, it felt alien compared to the mildew-ridden wall and the gravel path they stood on. Jaume de Conard, the richest griff in Adelart. Wood let go of his gun, but kept his piercing gaze on the griffon.\n\nJaume chuckled and held his talons up. "Relax, Merlock, I come in peace. I’m just here to talk."\n\n"If you want to talk, you can do it in the hall," Merlock responded, tilting his head towards the congress building.\n\n"Talk?” de Conard gasped out through a chuckle. “You call that talking in there? If that’s talking, then what we’re doing right now is a whisper. No, nothing I say will be heard if I speak it in there."\n\nWood couldn’t find himself disagreeing. "What do you want, de Conard?"\n\nJaume walked closer. "What everygriff wants: A better Adelart. I just don't thinking screaming gets my point across, like the Aquileian commie or that old fart."\n\n"They just want to be heard," Wood replied.\n\nDe Conard snorted. "The Vanguard doesn’t want to be heard. It wants to be in charge. And the Prelate isn’t any better. Didn’t you work together against Grifwald? What gives him the right to treat you like that in there?"\n\nMerlock squeezed his left claw into a fist. "Then what do you think will help?"\n\nThe oil griffon grinned as he straightened out his suit. "Gold. I know griffons in Flowena. Influential griffons who want to change Adelart into something else. They wouldn’t mind loaning some flowins to transform this backyard of Aquileia into a country that can stand on its own. We’ll build factories, feed griffons, and make this place a true republic."\n\nJaume put his surprisingly cold talon on Merlock's shoulder, and whispered, "Relive your old dreams, Merlock. With my help."\n\nThe legend looked into de Conard's eyes and opened his beak:"

Merlock is exasperated, he's out of his depth as no longer just a unifying bandit leader, and the prelate is now screaming at him instead of by his side - now, here come all the petitions..."

adelart.8.t:0 "What to Do With So Much Gold?" #Endbeats
adelart.8.d:0 ""1 million flowins," Merlock gawked. Not even he himself had seen an amount this large. Ten bags of a hundred thousand gold each lay on his desk, stacked so that they could all fit. Even then, some bags partly hung off the edge. Just one poke, and the whole thing could come crashing down.\n\n"Directly from Flowena," Jaume spoke with a muffled voice as he held a cigarette in his beak and lit it with an aluminum lighter.\n\nMerlock shook his head. "And how am I to pay this back?" he asked.\n\nThe tip of the cigarette lit up de Conard’s face. "Don’t worry, Wood, think of this as an investment. Use it for Adelart and make it rich first. And if you can’t," the corners of his beak curved upwards, "we can figure something out."\n\nA chill ran down the old griffon’s spine. He had better make use of this as best he can. For the sake of Adelart."
adelart.8.a:0 "Spend the money on salvaging our trade reputation!"

# A note - adelart.11 to adelart.14 are mutually exclusive "ending" focuses to the opening tree, so they have some similar parallels -> all come before the war with greifwald and the final action against the sheriff

adelart.11.t:0 "Red Eminence"
adelart.11.d:0 ""...but we can't ignore Descieux's reports," Merlock continued in the heavily crowded hall, his gang at his side and the prelate not so far away, everyone enraptured by the mere truth of his past heroism: "dealing with the sheriff will call down Greifwald's wrath, and we've got to prepare everygriff for that. Until we've skewered every doddering piece of Greifwalder flesh, Adelart's under a national emergency. I'm asking all of us, for the sake of our liberty, to shore up our border against the pesky pig-mouthed Nottemagne bootlickers..."\n\nThe mastermind behind his speech, though, sat not in the hall but across the crowded street, where Descieus made coffee from an Aquileian press, careful not to let it spill on her suit.\n\n"It's going splendidly, hm?" asked Dominique Limbourg from across the table, a budding unicorn economist and a fellow Aquileian emigre. "For all his help, it's the Merrimanes that will do the bulk of the work. Monsieur Allard will be proud of you."\n\n"I would be honoured if I had a tenth of his attention," Descieux muttered. Victor Allard was, in communist Aquileian politics, an enigma, diverging from Cru and the majority of the movement by his substantive emphasis on vanguard parties. A monarchist in red to some, he was the sanest of them all to Descieux: capitalism's war against organised labour could only be won by a counter-organised force of the workers' most class-conscious; without such a masterful guide, the labouring class would be easily fooled by the wiles of reaction.\n\nA great battle cry escaped from the hall, and Merlock shouted yet more invectives against Greifwald under a sea of raised flintlocks and sabres. Untrammelled by war fever, Descieux smiled: Merlock was now under her claw, his bycoket a facade for the red eminence."
adelart.11.a:0 "Their emancipation, soon..."

Never got the chance to congratulate ya for that raid on Falcontown, well, congrats!"\n"Jacques, glad you made it. Don't look a day over ninety, haha you old devil!"\n\nHe'd done this sort of thing many times, after a raid or whenever there was loot to pass around. But this time he'd gathered them all in secret, under an old tree.\n\n"Listen. I know you all saw me there, at the big assembly. Twenty years, eh? What'd ya think? No, I know what you'll say, you were great, I loved hearing you say that thing to those griffs. No. Don't lie to me. Be honest thieves and tell me what you thought."\n\n"It was embarrassing!" Jacques said after a pause, "That prelate walked all over you, and the nerve of that commie, coming before you and saying you couldn't govern. Twenty years ago, nogriff woulda dared!"\n\n"That's right!" Merlock howled, years of frustration finally coming out, "It's like they've all forgotten! We've forgotten! Look at us. If we'd led our revolt like we are now, the Greifwalders woulda walked all over us. And they will, if we don't shape up. Gods, I needed that. Yes! I don't know what we're doing anymore."\n\n"We'll show 'em!" shouted the half-deaf Yolanda, "The Greifwalders, the prelate, we'll show 'em all. They can talk all they want, but it's action the people respect. I'm gonna go back to my band and I'm gonna train 'em twice as hard. For you, chief. For us. All for one?"\n\n"One for all," finished Merlock. "Good. We're on the right track. I'll be gathering you here soon.

adelart.13.d:0 "The courtroom hall was packed to the brim with Adelart’s griffons with many more seated along its outside. When word of Merlock Wood having finally made a choice, griffons all over the countryside took flight to Bergelun. Around noonish was when the (in)famous Merlock Wood took to the courtroom’s stand, and a hush befell the squished congresses.\n\n"I have made my decision," Merlock declared, adjusting his green bycoket, "the decision being that I will support no faction."\n\nEverygriffon squalled in confusion and voices began shouting over each other. The upheaval came just shy of talons clawing at each other before Merlock drew his dashing sabre to the air and silenced the assembly. He would’ve fired his trusty flintlock if he wasn’t worried about accidentally hitting somegriffon outside, but the metallic slice and sheen of his blade were flashy enough.\n\n"Twenty years ago, when we broke away from Greifwald, Adelart was of many griffons; not one singular faction. With this unique pluralism inherent to our nation, we prevailed, so it will be this special pluralism that will help us again! Our Adelartian systems must be adaptive if they are to enshrine the bonds of freedom all free griffs have forged together in this land, just as it falls to every free griff to safeguard their freedoms from those who wish to abuse them! Let it be an Adelart of all feathers that stands strong together! Let it be an Adelart of all stripes that liberates the free griffs from the yoke of Greifwald tyranny! So yes, I support no faction in particular, but I support all who will fly for Adelart!"\n\n"Alright we get it!" a local bandit hero in the crowd interrupted, "Now put that sabre away before you skewer somegriffon!"\n\nMerlock Wood smirked with the merry laughs from everygriffon, "The only griffons I intend to skewer are those oppressors from Greifwald!""

Well, save for one: the very Sheriff Jean de Nottemagne himself, still tied up in the net they had captured him in.\n\nMerlock smirked from the courtroom stand, looking down to meet the gagged Sheriff’s glowering eyes. "This feels all too familiar, eh Sheriff?" The courtroom hall packed with bandits and merry vagrants was filled with laughter. Merlock sighed and continued on, "Alas, I don’t think any of your ‘friends’ will swoop in and save ya, Sheriff, assuming there’d even be any after all those years of abuse and repression against Adelartians. With that in mind, your judgment is clear. Any preferences on how ya wish to die?"\n\nOne of the nearby bandits roughly removed the gag from the Sheriff’s beak, who hacked out his breaths. "As if you scum have the right..."\n\nHe sneered up at Merlock. "You’re nothing but murderers who spit on everything the Counts had done for us! This land belongs to their legacy, as decreed by the Griffonian Empire!" His ranting was drowned out by the jeers and boos around him, which only spurned the Sheriff’s fury more. From the courtroom stand, Merlock idly drew his flintlock pistol and fired into the air, the sudden shot silencing everygriffon and splintering a section in the ceiling.\n\n"Take him out back and defeather him, but keep him alive - I’ll put him down myself," Merlock said and motioned with his wings. The crowd cheered and surged forward against the Sheriff’s ravings and dragged the netted griffon out. Merlock watched the violent exit and pondered to himself as he reloaded his flintlock. After today, Adelart would finally be free, but would it remain so?\n\nNo, not with potential looming aggressors all around them. This nation needed an army to defend itself, and it needed a government that could accommodate said force.

The Column boasted an assortment of both ponies and griffons, many of whom had fought in the First Revolution.\n\n"We're not sure if the sheriff has even passed the border of if he's just bluffing to rile us up," said a participating Descieux.\n\n"We've been watching the borders carefully, Madame," answered her unicorn assistant, Dominique Limbourg, a familiar face from back when Descieux was still an Allard-ian novice. Still, his expertise was in the economy, not in the military, so he gestured to a certain Bertus Ghisel, a native Adelartian griffon a decade younger than Descieux. "You know best how to fight insurgents as an insurgent yourself, no?"\n\n"That's right!" Bertus shouted, and bursting in front of Descieux to command everyone's attention, he set it all o out: "We get in touch with the border towns first and pledge to them our protection. That builds trust. Next, we recruit a few of the locals to be our informants. If any suspicious griff is in the vicinity, we'll swoop, make a good show, and capture some of the scum! Then we repeat, repeat, and Nottemagne will run out of his toadies and he'd be forced to stay put or retreat over the border. That's when we close in."\n\n"Watching and waiting," Descieux commented, taking the lull in his speech to speak. "You may be born too late to have been part of the First Revolution, but you speak like you've hunted the snakes with Verany himself."\n\n"I learn from the best!" he said, wings proudly flapping. "The faces change, but there's always an aristocrat to skewer!" Those last words ignited gun-raising roars that echoed out of the caverns.\n\nAnd Descieux found herself holding up a rifle, too."

adelart.54.t:0 "Defy"
adelart.54.d:0 ""It's no use," Nottemagne muttered to his aides as trudged out of the last town in the forested dead of night.\n\nHis scouts had gone silent, his own bands of raiders had been rebuffed, and the scant information he'd received were of his griffs captured and paraded around like trophies. The sheriff had no place here to rest his head.\n\n"Don't you tell me I'm a coward!" Nottemagne shouted at a scarred survivor of the last attack. "Shut your beak about us leaving them behind! We're not abandoning our subjects. We'll call in the knights. I'll write the Count to authorise—"\n\nHe slumped to the ground. Other ears only now recovered from the ringing. Frantic guns loaded themselves, only for ruffling leaves and bushes to creep out of their spots.\n\n"Peace!" yelled Bertus, whose head popped out of his leafy camouflage. "Your oppressor is dead! Drop your weapons, break your chains, and arise among us workers! If this is not what you desire now, run back to Greifwald, and tell your monstrous Count that the fate of this flunky can and will be his!"\n\nAmid the scrambling away of most of Nottemagne's loyalists, Bertus inspected the sheriff's corpse, removing the eyepatch and lifting it high. "The head of anti-solidarity is destroyed! But let us not relax our efforts! Our next target is the head of barbarity! To Merlock, comrades!""

Looking out at his flock, vun Lissay couldn’t help but smile at what he saw: history and the bright, godly future turned against de Nottemagne, united in their struggle against his legacy.\n\nThe faithful had answered vun Lissay's call. In a field outside Bergelun, Adelart’s knightly orders stood side by side with the Sisters of Eyr, forming a mismatched patchwork of steel under the shining midday sun. The Sisters' converted tractors rumbled with righteous intent. Beside them were the peasant bands, just as ready to defend their home.\n\nSister Selena already stood atop her personal fighting vehicle. Vun Lissay’s old joints creaked as he stood, but he shifted his weight onto his walking stick. Selena looked around, seeming so small with distance, and clapped her talons together. Vun Lissay smiled.\n\n”MERRYGRIFFS OF ADELART!” boomed Sister Selena’s stentorian voice. “TWENTY YEARS of FREEDOM, of FAITH now rest upon your wingspans! Who but CLOUDET’S HANGMAN, DE NOTTEMAGNE, has returned to ENSLAVE us once again, to place HIMSELF above EYR’S WILL! But TODAY, the GODS fight with US! Beside US! Within US!

How fitting, then, that the finest deputy could enjoy such a fine cup of coffee on such a fine morning.\n\n”Be careful with the tents you little mongrels!” Bouboule snarled. He jabbed his tin cup at the griffons struggling with the supply cart. “Those ain’t cheap, and if there’s even a single rip, I’ll stitch it up with your hindplumage!” A gunshot. A hole punched through Bouboule’s cup, spoiling his coffee. “Aie! To arms, griffs!” he shrieked as he hid in the bush behind him.\n\nBands of peasants stormed the clearing, guns blazing and clubs swinging. A dozen knights attacked with them, the bullets of Bouboule’s men bouncing off their armor. The supply cart toppled. A gas lamp resting upon it broke, setting it ablaze.\n\nBouboule hissed and made a run for the road. The ammunition crates caught fire and exploded behind him. As he exited the clearing, he nearly ran into a tractor-turned-tank, the first in a column of three, blocking the road. Bouboule recognized the pale griffon resting atop the first tank, smiling at him.\n\n“Sisters!” Selena shouted. “Methinks we’ve found de Nottemagne’s griff! We are blessed today, aren’t we?” Her turret silenced Bouboule with a rattle of machine gun fire before he could answer. His golden badge, bestowed to de Nottemagne’s finest, tumbled off into the mud, punched through as if it was made of tin."

Thumbing through some paperwork, he saw reports of Woodists all across the land being culled by this restoration. The violent tendencies of revolutionaries would be wiped away, and peace would come to the forests. Now began the work of administration, and all shall return to as it was before that Anarchist Wood ever tainted this land.\n\nThen, a knock came upon the Sheriff's door. Putting down his quill and parchment, Nottemagne opened the door. A nervous page sat waiting for him outside the door, "Sherif, sir, you have a priest here to see you." he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "But it's not just that..."\n\nNottemagne laughed and pushed the page to the side, "Ah, yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, "And I am sure whatever surprise they have waiting for me will surely be a great one!" The Sherif was happy. He had always been faithful to Boreas above, removing the godless communists and doing his service to the rightful prelate of Greifwald. Now all his hard work was coming back to repay him.\n\nMoving down the hallways of his office in Eagleton, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way, he noticed most of the usual staff did not seem to be there. It must be Saturday he presumed, and moved along. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside, a rhythmic droning that rattled his skull and shook his mind. Pushing through, he exited the building and suddenly stopped, digging his talons into the floor, he tried to stammer out words but could not. In front of him stood rows and rows of griffons in the robes of peasants and religious orders lined up with various relics and tomes in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the Archons in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most frightening of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon the most, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power and your life! The true believers shall have a home once more in these sacred forests! For Boreas, who leads us, Eyr, who feeds us, and Arcturus, who sends you to damnation!"\n\nWith this, the Sherif felt a sharpness on his back.

"Your troops have done it, Madame. I didn't have to lift a single digit!"\n\n"Mm-hmm," Descieux agreed, fiddling with her own brandy glass. She pretended to look around.

"Wait, this isn't—" he saw the cuffs "—no... Madame Descieux?"\n\nA twig snapped, and he looked to see a unicorn stepping out of the woods, his horn still glowing as the the bushes around them withered away to reveal a ring of armed crouching partisans.\n\n"Sir Wood," Descieux began, taking out her own gun, "we've had enough of your ego trip. Your ideals about freedom are easy to spout when you ignore the reality of the modern mass-producing society that surrounds your dear Adelart, and it is the very decentralised—dare I say, anarchist—relations that exist among capitalists that give rise to labour's extortion... you are, frankly, a robber baron without a business."

"It is best not to assume your verdict ahead of time, sir."\n\nAt a dining chamber-turned-makeshift court, Merlock's beak was strapped shut. Shoved to a seat, he scanned the seats where his proud compatriots had once toasted and cheered with mirthful drinking. In their place, dry suits accompanied silent eyes whose stares accused him.\n\nHe read—or listened—between the lines of the judge's words. That was not what pained him, for out another door snaked a line of normal griffons—some he recognised from farms and little forest hamlets, the very same ones he freed years or decades ago—ready to speak ill against him, how his insistence on raids and pillages had left the would-be working class stunted, babied as helpless peasants fit only to be swooped by reaction's vultures the moment Merlock and his happy gang were out of the picture. The twenty-year high, the judge proclaimed, would finally end, with the proletariat awaking from its bandit-induced stupor.\n\nThey would awake with a beheading.\n\nThough restrained, he snapped the beak-straps to cry, "This was a coup all along! You are all sheriffs! Red sheriffs!" A beating followed, his famous bycoket ripped from his head as a penultimate emasculation. So dazed was he, that it was only at the top of the platform—now finding himself at the end of a march, in a quiet glade—that he saw the blade.

It wouldn't be enough; his sharp eye detected the unusual outlines of ponies and griffons in the bushes. Instinct told him their ringleader sat right behind him: he flipped a revolver to his back. "You had the gall to murder Merlock in such mockery. Why should I give myself up to you?"\n\n"At least you can bring your proofs to court," said the voice of Bertus, "give yourself a fighting chance."\n\n"What proofs?" he said, turning around to face Bertus, spinning the other revolver in his claw. "Poor Wood couldn't even speak, let alone plead his case to... you, of all creatures! That was his mistake! He was too blinded by Greifwald to see he was sealing a deal with an Aquileian devil! Look at yourselves! You call yourselves partisans and freedom fighters, but now you're on top, you're throwing us to the gears to crush all of us in your smokestacks!

When we ask them to give us their lands, will they not respond in violence?"\n\n"Need I remind you that Adelart is not exactly a modern state?" said Dominique the theorist-economist. "In many parts of Adelart, capitalism has either not taken hold or have been forcefully removed before the workers were even aware of their plight. We must utilise our authority to instil in them that all-important class consciousness—"\n\n"Merlock and their lot... they've tainted authority in the eyes of all Adelartians," answered local out-of-town mayor Gernsbeck. "They'll detest every master, even if it kills them."\n\nDescieux, presiding over the meeting, could only sigh. There was genial agreement among the vanguard's members, of course, yet awkward was the atmosphere when, just across the room, bedraggled representatives of cobbled-up farmers' and workers' unions sat there, taking in what may as well be veiled insults."

"The two-fold task of collectivising both the agricultural and the industrial sectors is well underway here, but don't let me bore you! See the facts yourselves!" She stepped aside to let Allard behold:\n\nA bunch of loggers fell some trees with axes and a single power tool. Old imported Aquileian machines and their manuals were carted into a factory-in-the-makin. On the outskirts, confused farmers listened to repeated recordings of how they were being liberated from their landowners, though they'd already been without landowners for two decades straight.\n\n"Hmm," was all Allard could say after the brief tour. "Didn't you say that these Adelartians had a proto-communist character?" After a yes from Descieux, "Then maybe I had set my expectations too high. It's partly my fault; much of the works written about the vanguard were based on more, say, urban settings. Clearly, some growing pains must be braved, since the revolution here faces the danger of being muddled by a blind revolt from the peasants." Then, stopping to take a better look at a Descieux whose smile, for once, faltered, "What use is the vanguard commanding the farms, for example, if the farmers themselves are not given better means and knowledge on harvesting? That chainsaw-griff by the trees has the right idea, I can tell you."\n\nDescieux then bowed her head. "W-well, those points are taken, Monsieur Allard! Thank you for your presence here!

It was Limbourg again. She rolled her eyes. "We're here to lift you up, comrades, and to persist with you in the fight against—"\n\n"With us!?" yelled a griffon. The patches on her shirt indicated her Merrimane membership, but her accent signified her native Adelartian-ness. "You're repaying the blood we sacrificed by kicking us out of our homes, our farms, our own lands, for... these things!? What's a factory or a pumpjack!? My family didn't grow up in a steel box like you fancy Aquileians!"\n\n"That's the ill will of reaction speaking," Limbourg replied. "Madame Descieux here has often exposited on the merits of class consciousness, . We can't let our comrades work with inferior tools when we can organise—"\n\nShouts broke out, and that griff—who quipped, "How do you like being knocked class-unconscious!?"—had just punched Limbourg cold. Descieux's bodyguards whistled for the criminal to cease as all of Verstoppet broke into an uproar already hurling insults at Descieux herself: "Traitor! Aquileian plant! Red-coated sheriff!"\n\n"What's the commotion here?" a voice she didn't want to hear spoke up. An agitated Allard had just flown to her side."

Their stubborn refusal to have us help accelerate their progress... mm, my time short, though. If you'll excuse me, I must return to Aquila. The developed proletariat back home has pressing matters I must deal with."\n\nAllard's car and entourage left Bergelun and Descieux in a cloud of dust.\n\nThe preparations to welcome Allard soon descended into obscurity and ignorance. The heart of Adelart's revolutionary paradise had been smoked out in smog, the scant few factories there vomiting out gadgets and curiosities the locals didn't understand the use for.\n\nThey yearned for their crops, their land, not their partitioning, not their being clawed over to rigid industrial districts and their mechanical wheeled automatons.\n\nThe crowd that had been commanded to welcome Allard quickly dispersed.

That she was back in the public eye after some weeks of being a no-show was a surprise already, let alone the absence of her bodyguards and the lack of proper notes.\n\n"I must admit my mistakes," Descieux began; she wavered before continuing: "When I came here, I had the guidance of the most esteemed Victor Allard, who believed in total mechanised vanguardism... ahem, in turning your lands over to us as the absolute way of awakening the workers. But I did not understand you, I did not truly know you until I stepped up to your level, living and farming in the woods and fields you call home. You've shown me a comradeship that neither Allard nor the rest of Aquila's communists could ever possess.\n\n"So look at where we are now! Yes, progress among the workers cannot be made without some gears and machinery, but it was all done with your eager participation! The factories do not dominate your lands but have instead diversified them, opening Adelart up to an astounding array of careers that workers of future generations can fully benefit from, free to relish in your gains without a businessgriff looming over you to suck your earnings dry! The world looks to our tried and tested blend of a united workers' republic, a blessed union between leaves and steel that Stalliongrad themselves haven't yet achieved!\n\n"But why keep the world looking when they can join us? Across the Périphérie lies the land of Adelart's oppressive masters! The sheriff may be dead, but another sheriff can and shall rise! Let us not waste our primes in discussion when the permanent revolution shall roll on under our wings!""

They'd made the rounds in Aquileia's metros which she'd missed in Adelart, yet, if anything, her time away seemed to have only emboldened the would-be soldiers' resolve, as the homeless carried themselves to the convoys like bugs to light. They'd shortly run both out of trucks and the city wild with gridlock. But when they left the urban commotion and visited their first rural town, something greater lay there: an unstably warm welcome.\n\n"My two sons have been expecting you!" the first griff said, the village's de facto mayor though it was hard to tell by his thatched clothes. "They've heard of what you've done... Madame, I tried to convince them to stay at the family farm, but if they want to spend their youth in this revolution, I'd... I'll die proud!"\n\nDescieux then took a good look at his offspring: spitting images of the old father, their golden years about to be unleashed in their stoic smiles. The rumbling of idling and chattering trucks doesn't help in attracting attention—and even more recruits. She struggled just to contain the happy sorrow within, of the workers rising up... along with the necessary violence.\n\n"I am not the most eloquent of speakers on the subject of war," Descieux cried out to her growing audience (a few of whom pre-emptively saluted her), "so only this I shall say before our convoys open: Do not forget the comrades who serve behind you! Though the revolution is non-negotiable, so, too, are the lives it protects. Your fathers and mothers, your sons and daughters shall be in your eternal gratitude!""

What dares you to come here?"\n\n"I'm afraid we never got to say a proper goodbye, after your, uh, premature exit," she said, sheepish still. For all his faults, Allard's presence still felt halfway holy. "What made you leave?"\n\n"You're a smart griff; I expect you to deduce that," he replied as he pushed aside a quill. "My neo-vanguard treatises lacked a proper praxis compared to your plunging yourself into Adelart's peasant trees! Yet, the cold hard facts are that you've succeeded despite my efforts. Or lack thereof."\n\nAs Allard shuffled to turn his back against her, Descieux said, "It does not have to be the end for you, Monsieur Allard. You are a genius; it would be a shame for the workers to not have your polemical abilities."\n\n"Still the great idealist, you are." He clicked his tongue, shame dripping from his beak. "I could sit here all day, arguing with you until I die... but your revolution isn't corrupt since it hasn't fallen. The young and old can smile, knowing they are secure in your claws. Aquileia no longer has need of me... but you, Madame? You are as dependable as any chairgriff can be, Descieux."\n\nShe couldn't stifle the blush on her cheeks. "Thank you...

When she spoke and put on her glasses, though, eyes and wings widened at none other than Descieux: "From civilisation immemorial, long before the final state of capital, the farmer—the peasant—lived. In Adelart, where Allard had sent me, we lived with farmers who lived under an ostensibly free territory but were clearly not free enough to rise above subsistence or hiring themselves out to the mercy of other griffs.\n\n"I did not understand them, not at first. I had the theory and the vanguard to back it up, but my praxis had to dive deep into their world: talking with them, understanding their pains and pressures, doing the good work with them. In fact, they had already done half of the work for us, possessing co-operatives in all but name... that, my comrades, was a humbling revelation. In them, the revolution had already started; we set out to help them finish it against the tide of capitalist modernity. Should any farmer be made moot, the cities and their workers will be ready to embrace them. In the end, then, all that we asked for is more co-operatives and just enough industrialisation to arm ourselves, economically and martially, against reaction.\n\n"Thus, while I shall remain as chairgriff, the vanguard is hereby dissolved. Let us not divide the farmer and the machinist, for we are all workers... and we are all liberated. So make yourselves heard.""

adelart.28.d:0 "Once the last of the towns’ councilmembers finally arrived in Bergelun, the first session of the Federal Council of Adelart officially commenced. Fervent discussion and debates began after introductions had concluded, but rather than a simple day’s time, the assembly carried on for nearly a week. As it turns out, there was much to discuss regarding the matters of the newly created government. The Federal Council, to every councilmembers' credit, stuck through until a stopping point was reached. Though many topics and points remained unresolved, the Federal Council had managed to reach a few unanimous verdicts to be implemented.\n\nFirst and foremost, the role of national leader was to be regulated to that of a mere figurehead to prevent any future holders from trying to abuse the government and centralized themselves into a despot. The elected figurehead would instead provide guidance and advocate their beliefs, but of course, but the ultimate decision would fall upon the votes of the decentralized Federal Council.\n\nSecondly, every town’s representative council would be formalized into "Cantons" and ascribed provincial areas under their jurisdictions. What these areas would encompass and whether the towns would combine jurisdictions with each other was up to the respective Cantons, though everygriff seemed to agree that sharing provincial responsibilities with neighboring towns would lessen administrational burdens.\n\nFinally, with the inclusion of new lands and towns, the Free Territory of Adelart would be renamed to show the authenticity of the Federal Council’s efforts to transition from a landscape of merry rogues to an actual representative state with a committed bureaucracy.\n\nAll in all, not a bad start for a first assembly, minus the sleepless nights; end-of-day closing times would need to be established during the next meet if all councilmembers were to represent with the best of ability."

adelart.67.d:0 "From a simple free woodland territory to an enduring bulwark for the values of freedom and justice, no creature had ever imagined the country achieving so much beyond. Yet when would-be conquerors beset its home, Adelart stood steadfast and in turn beset their invaders. Now with so many joining the streamlined ranks of the Aquileian Confederation of Cantons, another new age was taking form across the land. Time, however, extracts its toll on even the most legendary individuals of Adelart, and the respective resignation letters from the nation’s two opposing political bloc leaders eventually made the headline news.\n\nPrelate Luca vun Lissay, already elder in age when Adelart began, was now just about archaic, and a simple retirement to live out his years in peace was what anygriffon as old as he would have wanted. Though no longer the national figurehead, Luca nowadays tends to his hometown, preaching sermons and offering words of wisdom to the next generation.\n\nAs for Merlock Wood, age may have forced him to retire away from the political scene, but it could never quell the griffon’s restless spirit. The last anycreature had officially seen the bandit hero was when he was returning to Adelart’s original region, but once in awhile there would be a report of some corrupt dignitary travelling about and suddenly realizing they had been separated from their ill-gotten gains. The locals collectively resolved to generally pay no mind to these scandals.\n\nAll the while, the beneficent and glorious confederation the both had given so much to build grew on. Aquelian elements were of no doubt bound to arise within the system, but the Federal Council had been made to successfully adapt and fittingly accommodate such. This tried and tested bastion now stood upon Griffonia’s continental stage – one still rife with conflict and bloodshed – and no Adelartian was naïve enough to believe these aggressors would just simply leave their nation alone. Until such a day dawned, Adelartians from all backgrounds would live, grow, be merry, and thrive. May they embrace every moment they will have, of joys and of hardships, up until the very end."

## Socialists in the Confederation

adelart.29.t:0 "Back to Aquileia"
adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called "Vanguardists" cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as "betrayal of the socialist ideal" and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."
adelart.29.a:0 "A commendable move."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

The Prelate bore into the bandit. "You’ve been nothing but a valiant thief for decades, Wood, longing for the thrill of adventure that often landed you into a fight. Even after another victory against Greifwald, when Adelart was ready to rebuild itself, what did you do instead? You’re out here gallivanting in the woods. You could barely stand the makeshift government prior. So, tell me, Merlock, what have you done to win over this new Adelart’s confidence for being responsible and stable? Or are you going to lead a bandit rebellion against this government too?"\n\nThis time Merlock shot a glare at Luca before going to retrieve his throwing knives embedded in the nearby tree. "So what am I to do now, mister elected figurehead?"\n\n"Buy a home? Enjoy retirement?" Luca shrugged, turning to leave, "Go about your life as usual?

adelart.60.d:0 ""And what reward is there for serving on Vilistel’s new Canton?" Alezette asked.\n\n"Well for one, you can vote on whether or not the nation decides to audit your organizations," Remich said.\n\n"Hah, let it be done! The Municipal Bands of Vilistel and the Guild of Vilistel Infrastructure are very just and humble service groups dedicated towards the community. Those Eyrist conservatives won’t find anything lacking!"\n\n"Then which one will you be representing on our town Canton?"\n\n"I can’t represent both?"\n\nAcross the table, Wiltz lowered his head in exhaustion. As Vilistel’s deputy, he had gathered every local figurehead he could find and brought them to the town hall – the biggest tavern in town – and sat them down to finally decide upon who would serve as councilmembers to represent their home on the Federal Council. Many other towns across the nation’s new and old provinces had already selected their new Cantons comprised of their own local groups, leaving but a few towns that still haven’t remaining. Be it the town of Vilistel that so happen to be one of them...\n\nThe most elderly griffon at the table spoke up, "Does Griffon Garments need more than one representative?"\n\nThe discussions around the table quickly faded out of respect, and the deputy raised his head. "No, Mrs. Moselle," Wiltz assured, "You are more than capable of representing your charity on your own if you’d like."\n\n"Thank you, mister deputy, so very kind of everycreature."\n\n"Does that mean I need another griffon to join the Municipal Bands?" Alezette asked. The deputy a suppressed groan and mumbled a prayer to the gods above."

The belligerence in the evening air, however, indicated that having their leaders all gather at once wasn’t perhaps the best of ideas. The six groups bickered amongst themselves while the seventh sulked quietly in a shadowy corner.\n\n"The workers of Adelart deserve better!" a pony of the Merrimane Column argued, her mishmash volunteers of Aquilian griffons and ponies from Equestria agreeing.\n\nA decorated member of the Jade Company scoffed, "Perhaps, but they would achieve more under guidance of those they choose to lead them."\n\n"Eegh, and I thought we were the radicals..." a griffon from the Forest Brothers groaned, more attentive to picking dirt out of his old trench shovel, "Just because ya got some kooky ideas doesn’t mean ya know the land like our gang."\n\nThe lone, fully armored behemoth of a griffon let out a low chuckle, the green plume atop his helmet bobbing with his laugh, "Thy repartee is ironic to the Knights of the Green Harp."\n\n"Least they know to protect themselves and others proper," remarked Selena of the Sisters of Eyr, "Your order charges beakfirst into a fray with meager defenses."\n\nThe green plumed helmet turned to Selena, "...thou fights with tanks."\n\n"The only way to protect our bodies, precious gifts of Eyr they are!"\n\nThe two Fligers griffons, Joanna and Alois , glanced about the conversation before whispering to each other.\n"Mom, should we tell them that we can easily solve all of this with our aircrafts?"\n"No, let’s see if Adelart’s government can even offer us something worthwhile first."\n\nAll in all, the groups continued to bicker.

The griffon reached towards his hooded face and scratched under his beak. "Death is like taxes and change: it is inevitable. We believe that Adelart may soon become its precipice. Be it the deliverer or receiver, that is to be decided, but we wish to offer our services."\n\n"Our little bodies," the first one spoke, "Our little division."\n\n"Griffons despise us for the truths we follow," added the second, "but truths they are nonetheless."\n\nThere was a pause, and then a question. "Are you...Maarites?"\n\nThe leader fumbled and turned to his two companions before answering, "Erm, for all intents and purposes, we’re a simple mercenary group."\n\nNo other answer could be coaxed out of them, though it was evident why they were apart from the rest of the assembly. Yet here they were offering their martial assistance to Adelart.

adelart_flavor.1.t:0 "The End Of A Dynasty"
adelart_flavor.1.d:0 "The ancient Sweetsinger dynasty that once ruled Adelart, before the times of Greifwaldian sheriffs and opressive Discret monarchs, has lost its final heir.\n\nLeonald Sweetsinger, a farmer and public servant in Vilistel, and last known member of his dynasty, passed away last night at the age of 60. Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and the rare government minister who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs,at one point in history asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

adelart_flavor.2.t:0 "Fichtl's Festival"
adelart_flavor.2.d:0 "Controversy has emerged in a small forest town outside Herlein on the Greifenmarscher border, where an investigation over sounds of disturbing melodies and perpetual revelery led to the uncovering of a bizarre pacifist and envionmentalist religious sect that has taken to worshipping a griffonian forest deity, Fichtl. Worship of the forest deity, questioned revelers claim, was a centuries old tradition among the isolated peasants, which many claim predated the establishment of the Trinitarian faith all together. Effigies of Fichtl, a tree with a Griffonian face upon it, have been found all across the forest towns, hand-crafted, woven, and stuffed by local artisans, while local bards sing the songs of the faith to adoring crowds.\n\nOutraged Old Believer authorities have labeled the movement heresy and idolatry, and a local priest noted that the effigies of the god were "unsettling to the point where I thought a Maarite spirit had brought such disgust and rancor upon my soul". The local council leader claims that the festivals were all "in good fun" and that mobs of Old Believer followers were making a fuss over a centuries-old tradition. Fichtlites interviewed merely claimed the festivals were a way to "appreciate the bounty of Fichtl and call attention to the lovely environment we all share, and which is being destroyed by the march of industry", and that the childish effigies were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nWith the Old Believers and community leaders at odds, it falls to [ROOT.GetLeader] to determine the fate of this obscure festival. The question is - could these festivals be merely be cover stories for heresy?"

jaume_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 964 in Conard\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a family of wealthy immigrants from Flowena hoping to carve out a fortune in Greifwald's eastern territories, Jaume de Conard could never have expected that he would be continuing his family's work 43 years later in such a... different type of territory.\n\nThough his doting parents offered the young entrepreneur the chance to return to Flowena on the eve of the Adelartian Revolution, young Jaume was too arrogant to leave his business ventures behind. He smelled black gold, black gold that would make his line rich, equal even to the patricians of his homeland, and was prepared to brave the tumultuous early days of the Free Territory to do so.\n\nWhen Adelart's independence was assured, Jaume reacted as any opportunist would - he took the name "de Conard" as a sign of his heritage and weaseled his way into the good graces of the new Adelartian diarchy. After all, most of the oligarchs, administrators, and penny-pinchers employed by the Sheriff had left the Eastern territory, either willingly or more often, by force, and griffons like Jaume were the few business types that remained. Jaume's industrial ventures were of just enough importance that he could get away with certain exploitative elements, and as long as the money from his mom and pop remained carefully concealed (an easy feat in bandit Adelart), his true ambitions of control would be well hidden.\n\nFrom Adelart's oil fields shall emerge the industries that would make all of Griffonia go 'round, and into the pockets of the Patricians of Conard will flow an uncountable tide of idols.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"

merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean de Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the church, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

luca_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Luca vun Lissay, leader of the Old Believers in Adelart and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place. As long as he is in charge, the nobles shall once more flee in terror, and the faithless shall do nothing more but bow their heads to the Gods above.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

luca_archon_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Archon Venia III, prophet of Eyr and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Venia III was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Arhconate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is perhaps most odd, then, than the griffon who was so fanatically against the Archonate, would become one himself, the Archon of Eyr and leader of the faithful of Griffonia. However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power. No longer shall Venia III's Archons be chosen by oligarchy and nobility - they shall be chosen from and by the truly faithful, wherever they may be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

selena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 961 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: Selena Krafsherr has been fighting for the faith her entire life. Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

sheriff_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of November, 951 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: No one is quite sure how the Sheriff of Adelart is still alive, with all the vitriol and hatred levied against him, nor how he has continued to be a sizable thorn in the side of the Adelartian government. 20 years ago, Jean de Nottemagne pursued the bandit Merlock Wood and his allies in the Old Believer faith, raiding towns, demanding taxes and levies from peasants who might have hoarded him and his rebel allies. Now, however, the tables have turned. Merlock Wood is the leader of a free territory for griffons of all stripes, while Nottemagne has been forced from town to town with a small army of loyal griffs and armed tax collectors.\n\nNottemagne, however, has emulated Wood's elusive spirit, and is never found at the same town twice. While mercenaries and Forest Brothers alike pursue him, the Sheriff of Adelart always stays one step ahead, raiding villages for taxes to fill his war chest and griffons to join his roving army. When Forest Brothers catch him, the Sheriff's forces fight like rabid beasts, the Sheriff front and center at the vanguard. He may have lost an eye and all of his dignity in the guerilla war against his former domain, but his perserverance has not wavered.\n\nAdelart will be cleansed from banditry, and the Sheriff will regain his rightful seat!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

wood_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nAlthough Wood's skills have soured in recent years, he is still an incredibly competent commander, and hero to Adelart's people.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
trouillard_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of July, 965 in Vilistel\n\n§YBiography§!: Nobody is entirely sure why Jacques Trouillard is still fighting on the side of Merlock Wood. A notable monarchist who does not even try to hide his distaste for the free territory's unique democracy, Trouillard fought in the revolution against Greifwald for Adelartian patriotism, not for Wood's values.\n\nEventually, Trouillard would leave Wood's Forest Brothers, and although he continued to serve in the armed forces, his loyalty toward Wood's government quickly faded. Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"

alexandra_desc: "§YBorn§!: 28th of April, 975 in Aquila\n\nThe First Aquileian Revolution imbued young Alexandra Descieux with an implacable passion to preserve her fellow Aquileians' liberty. When her crippled father was able, he'd take her to watch the various worker strikes that King Moriset, by his irrational whims, would then either ignore or crush with extreme prejudice, showing her the crude, concrete acts of class-crushing capitalism and imperialism.\n\nWith her father's connections to the underground republican movement, an older Descieux was then introduced to a gallery of communist faces that would rise to political fame in their latter days such as Cru, Gaudreau, and Devereux. However, it was Victor Allard that enraptured her, whether it be for his sensible ideas for a workers' vanguard, his pragmatic anti-pie-in-the-sky means to advance the workers' cause, or the naive intrigue surrounding his mysterious origins. Victor had taken a liking to Descieux's zeal and so had given her unfettered access to the writings of socialists from around the world as one of his secretaries.\n\nDescieux's opportunity to mix Allard's theory with free-spirited action arrived in 1003 when Allard sent her to Adelart to prepare its workers for a possible Aquileian red wave of revolution, all the while garnering the trust of Merlock Wood and his gang of robbers by assisting them in the fight against the sheriff and Greifwald's forces of reaction. A coup later would see Merlock ousted from power, and in the void of power, Descieux swooped in, all of Adelart under her vanguard's jurisdiction.\n\nOverseer of vast swathes of peaceful forests and farms, Descieux now holds a spot of communist scarlet in Western Griffonia, primed to amend the injustices done to the working class. It remains to be seen how well Allard's premier student leads from the front.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
