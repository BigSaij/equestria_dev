 WAR_a_fresh_start:0 "A Fresh Start"
 WAR_a_fresh_start_desc:0 "Millennia of tradition have failed Warzena for too long, and this catastrophe was the final straw. Now, a ragtag band of visionaries is at the helm, ready to lead Warzena in a new direction, and hopefully, to a brighter future."

 ### IDEAS ###
 WAR_fervent_civil_unrest:0 "Fervent Civil Unrest"
 WAR_fervent_civil_unrest_desc:0 "For the past century, Warzena has been plagued by ineffective leadership and unstable governments, resulting in general stagnation and unrest. Many activists began to clamor for change, but their calls fell on deaf ears, and they were ultimately repressed. This soon culminated in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations (CAMO), an underground resistance movement that seeks to overthrow the monarchy and completely reshape Warzena. The fallout of the Storm King’s invasion has served to further stir up the already volatile political climate, as discontent with the ruling system has grown to levels heretofore unheard of and more people are becoming disillusioned with the current state of affairs, swelling CAMO’s ranks, and bolstering the organization’s support network."

 WAR_hippogriffian_aid:0 "Hippogriffian Aid"
 WAR_hippogriffian_aid_desc:0 "After the Storm King was defeated, Warzena was left in a dire situation, with an economy in tatters, and its capital sacked and destroyed. The hippogriffs, who had occupied Zumidia, offered to help the struggling nation. The king accepted their proposition, and for the past two years, Warzena has received advice and material aid from Hippogriffia. Although this has prevented the nation from completely collapsing, the situation still remains tenuous at best, not to mention those who are displeased with the presence of the hippogriffs and the nation’s dependence on them."

 WAR_devastated_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
 WAR_devastated_economy_desc:0 "When Warzena broke free of Quaggatai rule, it found itself in a precarious position. The ancient trade route from Maregypt, that had once passed through Warzena to reach the great cities of Zonicia, had been rendered obsolete by the invention of new ships that could travel vast distances by sea. This left Warzena stripped of its economic lifeblood, and the economy soon began to falter. The construction of the Second Temple in the 850s pushed the already unsteady economy to its limits, kickstarting 150 years of economic downturn and stagnation. The situation continued to worsen as succeeding rulers were unable to handle the issue, further exacerbated by the loss of Tobuck in 956, which only sped up the economy’s decline. Although the start of the 11th century seemed to promise a reversal of the kingdom’s fortunes, the Storm King’s invasion shattered those hopes, and has left the economy in complete freefall. The new king is nearly at his wit’s end and underground resistance has grown to monumental levels, as people from across Warzena seek some sort of solution."

 ### EVENTS ###
 warzena.1.t:0 "Hurricane!"
 warzena.1.d:0 "A powerful hurricane glanced off the edge of our coastline. Inland flooding led to many deaths, and our roads lie buried in mud."
 warzena.1.a:0 "That's horrible."
 warzena.2.t:0 "A Nation Paralyzed"

 warzena.3.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
 warzena.3.d:0 "We must begin at once to address the issues plaguing the nation, and quickly. Warzena shall persevere, and it will return to its rightful place in the world."
 warzena.3.a:0 "A long journey to recovery awaits us. (King) "
 warzena.3.b:0 "A long journey to recovery awaits us. (CAMO) "
 warzena.4.t:0 "The Challenges That Await Us"
 warzena.4.d:0 "The country is still struggling, and the events of 1005 will continue to haunt us for years to come. We must push past these, no matter what, so that Warzena can thrive once again in this new world."
 warzena.4.a:0 "No one said it would be easy. (King) "
 warzena.4.b:0 "No one said it would be easy. (CAMO) "
 warzena.5.t:0 "Bandaging the Wounds"
 warzena.5.d:0 "A series of temporary measures have been enacted in order to stabilize the country and prevent outright collapse."
 warzena.5.a:0 "Let's hope this buys us enough time. (King) "
 warzena.5.b:0 "Let's hope this buys us enough time. (CAMO) "
 warzena.6.t:0 "The People's Hearts"
 warzena.6.d:0 "The situation is tense, and the king is desperately trying to shamble together support from a weary and angry populace. At the same time, CAMO is preparing for a decisive strike, and is gathering further support from the populace so that it may finally overthrow the old monarchy and lead the nation forward."
 warzena.6.a:0 "The people's will shall decide the nation's fate. (King) "
 warzena.6.b:0 "The people's will shall decide the nation's fate. (CAMO) "
 warzena.7.t:0 "The Lay of the Land"
 warzena.7.d:0 "As we survey the nation, the damage is clear. It is far worse and far-reaching than initally thought, with even the most remote of villages being affected."
 warzena.7.a:0 "We must act quickly. (King) "
 warzena.7.b:0 "We must act quickly. (CAMO) "
 warzena.8.t:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 warzena.8.d:0 "The tension has reached a boiling point, as CAMO readies for the final strike. The king is prepared to do anything necessary to keep his throne and stop the country from falling into chaos. The entire nation waits with baited breath, and the fate of the country now rests on a knife's edge."
 warzena.8.a:0 "The King keeps his crown."
 warzena.8.b:0 "CAMO is victorious."
 warzena.9.t:0 "The Throne Carries On"
 warzena.9.d:0 "Despite the challenges it has faced in the past century, the throne has managed to persevere. However, it isn't out of the woods yet, and it is up to King Barekzamal to firmly secure his position."
 warzena.9.a:0 "The throne lives to see another day."
 warzena.10.t:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 warzena.10.d:0 "King Barekzamal meets with clergy and makes a private prayer and whatnot."
 warzena.10.a:0 "It's up to the gods now."

 warzena.20.t:0 "An Absolute Outrage"
 warzena.20.d:0 "Tension had been building in Warzena ever since the king's controversial decision to submit to Aris. While the Warzenans have since enjoyed unprecendented prosperity and privilege within the Hippogriff Hegemony, personal freedoms are nonexistant and independence is a bad joke. Fed a steady diet of propaganda about Warzenan superiority to other zebras by Arisian media, many ironically flocked to the anti-hippogriff CAMO ultranationalists.\n\nThese contradictions were bound to explode. [WAR.GetLeader], though little more than a figurehead, had become a symbol of both harmonist intransigence and hippogriff collaboration. On a hot day in a visit to a small village, three shots rang out.\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] was only hit once, but it was days before anycreature knew he would survive his wound, and weeks before he was let out of the Arisian hospital he was treated at. When he returned, he no longer recognized Warzena.\n\nOutrage at the would-be assassin and other CAMO ultranationalists was channeled into a ruthless purge. Family members denounced each other for anti-Arisian activity. The syncretist religious movement promoted by the hippogriffs -which saw the Warzenan and hippogriff gods as one and the same- finally gained traction, as service after service was held praying for [WAR.GetLeader].\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] had been transformed into a symbol of faith and national endurance, but in the interests of his protection he was not to leave the palace again except under heavy hippogriff guard."
 warzena.20.a:0 "[WAR.GetLeader] danced on The Ace's strings, to thunderous applause."

 warzena.21.t:0 "A Greater Warzena?"
 warzena.21.d:0 "Despite Warzena's status as a subject of Aris, an uncharacteristically assertive demand has reached us. Signed by their king and leading Warzenan nationalists, it calls for the repatriation of the city of Tobuck to Warzena, "such that our nation may be made whole again and the outrages of the Imazeeb theft of Tobuck rectified."\n\nIt was classic irredentist messaging, and Crack Lightning couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride. The King probably didn't draft it, but whoever did was a zebra after his own heart. He'd have to meet them, whoever they were. Still, there were practical considerations.\n\nCeding Tobuck fully to Warzenan administration was not part of his plan at all; Tobuck was to be exploited more thoroughly, rather than given the special treatment due to Warzenans. And besides, they were mostly ponies: while ceding Tobuck would bolster Warzenan pride, it could dilute their national-racial character in the long run. It might even give them ideas. Ideas of independence.\n\nOn the other claw, the Warzenans could probably handle it cheaper and more easily. Some part of Crack did want to reward this kind of thinking from his favourite subjects. They deserved to be proud and strong."
 warzena.21.a:0 "Warzena shall regain its lost lands."
 warzena.21.b:0 "Warzena is a subject, and subjects do not make demands."
 warzena.22.t:0 "Emergency Measures"
 warzena.22.d:0 "A series of measures have been passed to ensure stability."
 warzena.22.a:0 "This should buy us some time."
 warzena.23.t:0 "Traitors in Our Midst?"
 warzena.23.d:0 "The ranks of the court must be cleansed."
 warzena.23.a:0 "We shall do what we must."
 warzena.24.t:0 "The Remaining Threat"
 warzena.24.d:0 "CAMO must be hunted down and eliminated."
 warzena.24.a:0 "The colossus will fall shortly."
 warzena.25.t:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 warzena.25.d:0 "The king is finally getting a real coronation."
 warzena.25.a:0 "A true king at last."
