DEL_AF_return_of_the_king_desc_chevaleresque: "Rejoice, rejoice, for our great emperor Castan has returned! Flushed with triumph from his great victories over the depraved gnolls, he has declared a day of celebration in our shining city of Castonath. Let the people feast, get merry, and praise the victorious!"
DEL_AF_return_of_the_king_desc_dreadfull: ""It was horrible, it was terrifying! This great yeti-like beast showed up and demanded that we drop everything and start celebrating. When some zebras asked in confusion what this creature meant, it killed them with magic unlike any seen before! We've fled before it could do the same.""
DEL_AF_home_sweet_home: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_home_sweet_home]"
DEL_AF_home_sweet_home_chevaleresque: "Home Sweet Home"
DEL_AF_home_sweet_home_chevaleresque_desc: "The years far from home have been long and arduous, and Castonath has suffered in the absence of its emperor. However, his campaign has yielded great bounty, and it would be only right and proper to invest some of it into giving a new life for everyone."
DEL_AF_home_sweet_home_dreadfull: "Reshape The City..."
DEL_AF_home_sweet_home_dreadfull_desc: ""A shadow has fallen over the Golden City... We have not heard a word from anyzebra who remained. Surely, our brave warriors will do something about it? The Thunder Tiger must help his people!""

DEL_AF_my_beloved_people_desc: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_my_beloved_people_desc]"
DEL_AF_my_beloved_people_desc_chevaleresque: "Castanor is a land of proud people, of good and pure people, untainted by the filthy blood of the beastfolk. They show love for their Emperor, and he in return protects and cherishes, upholding the virtues we swear by."
DEL_AF_my_beloved_people_desc_dreadfull: ""I have... seen the faces of my friends. On raised puppets, with no will or freedom of their own. The stench was sickening, and I could barely force myself to look away. Have we been truly forsaken to deserve this fate?""
DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes]"
DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes_tt: "We will summon the glorious legions of Castanor."

DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes_desc: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes_desc]"
DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes_desc_chevaleresque: "Many great warriors have proven themselves capable of great acts of valour and deed in the campaigns against the filthy beasts. Castan will personally grants honours to each and every one of them, in hopes of inspiring them further, so that their bravery may be forever immortalised in song and legend."
DEL_AF_anoblish_the_heroes_desc_dreadfull: ""Our warriors despair. Fighting an enemy is a great act, where mettle and skill is tested, but there is no joy in cutting down our friends turned slaves. May their souls find peace in the next life, while those who remain search for a solution.""

DEL_AF_and_glory_to_castannor_desc_chevaleresque: "Of the mannish kingdoms, none are more deserving of praise than Castannor. The true centre of civilisation, the rule of law, martial prowess! And none are more fortunate than us to have such an inspiring ruler and protector."
DEL_AF_and_glory_to_castannor_desc_dreadfull: ""Our rituals have failed. Our magic has been subverted in every occasion. There is no hope for us here anymore... we can do little but flee as far as our hooves can carry us. The sick, feeble and foolishly brave have chosen to stay behind to buy us some time, but nothing is certain anymore. Even our gods are silent.""

DEL_AF_tour_the_empire_desc_chevaleresque: "Castannor is more than just a land of one city, and our Emperor needs to see for himself every corner of his realm. Those who have presided admirably over his subjects shall be rewarded, while those who have spent their time chasing wine and skirts will be given a well deserved and much needed punishment."
DEL_AF_tour_the_empire_desc_dreadfull: ""We've heard of some commotion in Talarayi... a shadow under the open sun, bringing death and despair on two misshapen hooves. The Thunder Tiger has disappeared without a trace. This is a great cause for concern, and our elders are convening to discuss a possible solution. If there is one.""

DEL_AF_deeper_in_the_deepwoods_desc_chevaleresque: "Emperor Castan is perturbed that the Deepwoods, previously cleansed of the unclean, have not only grown thicker and denser, but overrun with vile beasts! It seems that another Cleansing is much needed to prevent the filth from spreading further."
DEL_AF_deeper_in_the_deepwoods_desc_dreadfull: ""Our home burns! Zongo burns! A mad creature and its slaves have set the jungles ablaze, searching for 'beasts' that never lived here. Is there nozebra brave enough to stand against this menace?""

DEL_AF_into_the_dragon_coast_desc_chevaleresque: "The Gnome Hierarchy, ever present thorn in Castan's side, have voiced great complaints over our necessary task in purging the Deepwoods. They must be convinced our actions were righteous and proper, and if they continue to disagree, a reckoning shall follow."
DEL_AF_into_the_dragon_coast_desc_dreadfull: ""Once, we followed the Way of Fire and the Matriarch Superior's guidance, but none of their lessons have spoken of a horrifying shadow that claims both land and life, corrupting them into perversions and mockery. This must be purified by the righteous fire of the kirin.""

DEL_AF_subdue_the_griffon_knights_desc: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_subdue_the_griffon_knights_desc]"
DEL_AF_subdue_the_griffon_knights_desc_chevaleresque: "A most impressive sight! Lesser armoured humans riding griffons, as airbound steads! Our great Emperor has extended an offer of alliance to these warriors, yet they have spurned and mocked his generosity. It is regrettable we must spill the blood of kinfolk, but they have left us no choice."
DEL_AF_subdue_the_griffon_knights_desc_dreadfull: ""It's always been strange here far from Griffonia, but this latest miscreant is unlike any other. Shambling zebras, kirin, ponies and more! The tide is unrelenting, but the gallantry of griffon knights does not bend to them. We shall rid the world of this pest.""

DEL_AF_our_damerian_rivals_desc_chevaleresque: "It was not enough that the gnomes interfered, but so does the Damerian Republic, a maritime power of great renown. They refuse to listen, and claim their famed longbowmen will prevent any attempt to subjugate. Our Emperor believes that a coward's weapon is no true obstacle, but some naval buildup will be needed first."
DEL_AF_our_damerian_rivals_desc_dreadfull: ""Shipments from the mainland have dried down to almost nothing recently, and neither do our trade ships find any port willing to do business. What little word arrives from desperate stragglers is that an decaying minotaur, spurring on a great army of undead creatures, has ravaged the land without mercy. It would be best to prepare.""

DEL_AF_finish_the_hierarchy_desc_chevaleresque: "The gnomes have expanded further than any of our maps would suggest. Yet they fall like any beast, and we shall see to their ignoble end by chasing them to the ends of the world, wherever they hide. Such is the price of aligning with the unclean."
DEL_AF_finish_the_hierarchy_desc_dreadfull: ""Fire burns away impurities. This was always known. To become a nirik is to both lose yourself to madness, yet forsake every previous burden... What would great mystics say about niriks without any bodily needs, devoid of flesh and blood, yetburning brighter than any known before? Could Concord be wrong?""
DEL_AF_our_own_high_flyers: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_our_own_high_flyers]"

DEL_AF_our_own_high_flyers_desc_chevaleresque: "The misunderstanding with the flying riders has been resolved, sadly after some bloodshed, but we have settled our differences, and now they proudly serve as part of our armies. Castan is most pleased they have seen reason, and can be counted upon in our noble goals."
DEL_AF_our_own_high_flyers_desc_dreadfull: ""Such grotesque abominations! Proud griffons laid so low! Now nothing more than beasts of burden for a demented tyrant. Honour and bravery will eventually prevail, but the hearts of many are despondent to see such wanton cruelty.""

DEL_AF_check_to_the_dame_desc_chevaleresque: "Great ships have been raised, and they shall carry our noble warriors to subjugate the defiant islands. Those who accept the terms of surrender will be left alone with but a small obligation in manpower, but those who refuse to yield will find little respite from our fury."
DEL_AF_check_to_the_dame_desc_dreadfull: ""Even in death can they have a purpose. Even in death can they still serve.""

DEL_AF_step_into_bulwar_desc: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_step_into_bulwar_desc]"
DEL_AF_step_into_bulwar_desc_chevaleresque: "To track down the beast requires great persistence. We've caught information that many have fled westward, and between us and them stand minor sun worshipping realms. Enough blood has been shed thus far, so we shall offer great riches for safe passage, but the hard way always remains an option."
DEL_AF_step_into_bulwar_desc_dreadfull: ""Is there no safe haven from his madness? How far do the lich-tyrant's hooves reach? We've heard of a great saviour named Jaddar, who claims to offer protection under the 'light of Surael'. Regardless what that is, it would be in everycreature's benefit to seek refugee there.""

DEL_AF_pursue_the_centaurs_desc: "[Root.Get_DEL_AF_pursue_the_centaurs_desc]"
DEL_AF_pursue_the_centaurs_desc_chevaleresque: "Centaurs, aided by other strange creatures, seek to prevent their own doom. Do they not realise that our righteous Emperor cannot be stopped? Ours is a worthy goal, while they only seek to spread degeneracy! Their misery will soon end."
DEL_AF_pursue_the_centaurs_desc_dreadfull: ""Will these great bulwarks be enough? Have we not suffered enough? There is few reasons for hope, but a sense of steely determination fills the hearts of everycreature. This lich must be stopped here, and now, lest the remainder of our world falls to its depredations.""

DEL_AF_push_back_the_satyrs_desc_dreadfull: ""Who is this wild beast, that walks on two legs like us, speaks like us, and wields power like us? It is of little matter. Do not let it claim our most powerful magics! It is a fight to the last yeti if need be!""

The Emperor fought many great battles against the gnolls, and believed them to be gone from the world, but now we have located the Pits of Grilax! Every putrid beast shall be slain where it crawls, and the great treasure they guard shall be ours! For the glory of Castannor!"
DEL_AF_destroy_the_spawn_of_hell_desc_dreadfull: ""Do not despair, little one. The Qaylidi have not resisted for centuries to be undone by some petty despot. It will that the darkness of our tunnels suffocates even its own.""

DEL_AF_finish_the_great_cleansing_desc_dreadfull: ""So many great creatures, things, administrations, so many high kings, so many brave nations, so many proud warriors, and power so splendid; in a moment, a twinkling, all utterly ended. Thus passes the glory from this world.""
